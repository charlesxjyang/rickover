      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document, detailing the 1960 AEC Authorizing Legislation Hearings, features Admiral Hyman Rickover&#x27;s compelling testimony on two key areas: the Shippingport Atomic Power Station and nuclear submarines. Rickover underscores Shippingport&#x27;s vital role as a transparent research and development plant, citing its impressive fuel burnup rates (averaging 1,990 megawatt-days per ton, peaking at 8,770 MWd/ton in its natural uranium blanket) and the pragmatic decision to upgrade its core to 150 megawatts, utilizing a ~$4 million heat sink for excess energy to facilitate ongoing, uninterrupted research for all water reactors. Concurrently, he issues a stark warning about the Soviet submarine threat, estimating their fleet at 450 vessels with a 100-per-year build capacity, and passionately argues that the U.S. is &quot;frittering away a lead&quot; by not constructing more attack submarines (despite a claimed U.S. capability of 10 additional per year). Rickover contends that short-range, submarine-launched missiles represent a *greater* threat than ICBMs due to their accuracy and the vulnerability of U.S. coastal industry. The hearings also include AEC Chairman John A. McCone&#x27;s explanation of how the commission internally reallocated approximately $11 million from various projects (e.g., Euratom R&amp;D, Eniwetok Proving Grounds) to fully fund Project Rover, the nuclear rocket program, demonstrating a strategic approach to budget management.</p>

<p>Mr. Luepecke. I would like to correct an error in our testimony on<br>Tuesday, Mr. Chairman, when it was indicated that the size of this<br>project was the same as for last year. This was in error. In fact, last<br>year’s project was $3 million and this is $4 million. ,</p>
<p>Representative Hotmre.p. I noted that 2 years ago you had $2 mil-<br>lion, last year $8 million, and this year $4 million. i appreciate the<br>increases involved in this. I am wondering if the increase is in line</p>

<p>Representative Houriip. The thing we are concerned with, as Sen-<br>ator Anderson said, is that we start on one of these and it seems to go<br>up, both in capital cost by changes and also in the cost of operation.</p>
<p>In line with this $105 million accelerator at Stanford, we wonder if<br>you start at $105 million if you are going to end up at $200 million.</p>
<p>Dr. McDaniru. Perhaps during the later hearings before the com-<br>mittee we can explain this. I believe our experience on these other<br>machines will help us in preparing a better estimate on the Stanford<br>accelerator.</p>
<p>Representative Hormieiy. We are going into that in more detail<br>as soon as reports are available.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Again speaking from the same side of the<br>tossed coin as Mr. Holifield, the design of this particular machine in<br>relation to capital cost would have cost infinitely more if the previous<br>design had been used. This is a capital-cost-cutting design, as I under-<br>stand it ; is that right ?</p>
<p>Dr. McDanret. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You get a good deal more for your dollar<br>in terms of intensity and force than you do with the older.</p>
<p>Representative Horirieip. It is a capital cost, but the ratio of value<br>appears to be greater to the dollars; is that right?</p>
<p>br. McDaniev. That is correct.</p>
<p>Representative Hosser. If it was considered in cost per kilowatt as<br>we do powerplants, it would be a cut down in the cost.</p>
<p>Representative Wrstnanp. Is there anything comparable to this any<br>place else in the world?</p>
<p>Dr. McDanien. There is no machine under construction that I<br>know of, and I believe we have good information. There is no ma-<br>chine, » 12.5 Bev. proton accelerator, of the high intensity of this<br>machine: no, sir, It would be a unique machine and highly applauded<br>by the scientific community.</p>
<p>Representative Horan. Are there further questions on this?</p>
<p>If not, we will pass on to section (b).</p>
<p>At this&#x27;time we will ask Admiral Rickover to come forward.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ALTERATIONS TO SHIPPINGPORT REACTOR FACILITIES</p>
<p>Mr. Lugpecks. Section L07(b), project 60-e-12, is a request for an<br>inerease in authorization for the alterations of the Shippingport<br>reactor facilities from the authorized $5 million in the 1960 bill to a<br>total of $9 million, to enable the Commission to go ahead with the<br>increase of the core size to 150 megawatts, and to provide a heat dump</p>
<p>to take care of the excess steam over and above the capabilities of the<br>present generating facilities.</p>
<p>r. . Representative Horirmp. Are there any questions on this?<br>~ Representative Van Zanpr. What is the cost to us now for a kilowatt<br>of energy at the Shippingport plant?<br>; Admiral Rickover. You realize, Mr. Van Zandt, that on a develop-<br>~~ ment project such as Shippingport, cost figures on power generation</p>
<p>have fittte meaning. To give you a specific number, however, some-<br>thing like 70 or 75 mills is of the right order. But it is not a realistic<br>figure because we are doin things with the Shippingport plant you</p>
<p>ne</p>

<p>would never do in a plant built and devoted exclusively to the com-<br>mercial generation of electric power.</p>
<p>Phat is the point I want to develop. In<br>other words, this is a research and development plant.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir; this is a research and development<br>project, and from this project we are obtaining by far the majority<br>of knowledge being developed for all water reactor plants, both pres-<br>surized and boiling. This information is also of great value to other<br>types of reactors.</p>
<p>Questions on the cost of the Shippingport project have largely<br>stopped in the last year when those who a0 to complain bitterly about<br>the cost of Shippingport are running into the same high levels of costs<br>themselves. do now the only question left to them is the cost of a unit<br>of electric power from Shippingport.</p>
<p>One thing we do at Shippingport not done for any of the other<br>plants is that we put down our real costs; there are no hidden costs<br>or subsidies of any kind. All other reactors being built or planned,<br>in computing their costs, assume they are going to run at a load factor<br>of 80 percent.</p>
<p>You see, when you try to find out the cost from any of the com-<br>mercial reactors, you can never get the complete figures. But the cost<br>figures on Shippingport are always available to you because the only<br>money we have is the money you appropriate. So that ties it right<br>down, But you’ cannot find out from anyone else what their true<br>costs are.</p>
<p>. Representative Van Zanpr. What does it cost us to operate the Ship-<br>pingport lant ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It costs the Government about $2 million a year.<br>I am not talking about the research and development. I am talking<br>about what it costs the U.S. Government to run the plant.</p>
<p>Representative Hortrterp. Does that include fabrication of fuel?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. N 0, sir; that does not include research, develop-<br>ment, or the fuel fabrication costs. The $2 million is an extra sum the<br>Government puts in to carry out operational tests with the reactor</p>
<p>lant. If we stopped all research and development today, $2 million<br>is what it would cost the U.S. Government to get the necessary test<br>data out of Shippingport.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvt. Is the plant down at the present time?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Yes, sir; the plant is down for re ueling at the<br>present time. In about 2 months we expect to have it back in opera-<br>tion. —</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpt. What core is this?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We are still on the first core. This first core<br>consists of a seed and a blanket. The first seed contained about 75<br>kilograms of fully enriched U2&quot; and the blanket has about 14 tons of<br>natural uranium.</p>
<p>When we designed the plant, we estimated that the blanket of the<br>first core would last for two seeds. We also estimated that the life<br>of the first seed would be about 3,000 full-power hours. Actually, the<br>seed ran for 5,800 full-power hours.</p>
<p>We are in the process of replacing this first seed with a second seed.<br>The second seed will operate, we estimate, about 1,000 hours longer<br>than the 5,800 hours of the first seed.</p>
<p>r</p>
<p>One of the most important factors in evaluating economics of nu-<br>clear power from reactors using natural or slightly enriched unanium<br>is the expression known as “megawatt-days per ton.” The Shi pping-<br>port reactor has at present been subjected to a greater megawatt-days<br>per ton burnup than an reactor in the world. I am talking about<br>natural uranium. So all of the promises, all of the statements being<br>made about the life of power reactors of any kind, are based largely on<br>what we have proven so far at Shippingport.</p>
<p>This includes the British Calder Hal] type reactors, too. The<br>average megawatt-days per ton, until the present time, to which we<br>have subjected the Shippingpet natural uranium blanket, is about<br>1,990. That is average,</p>
<p>&#x27; Representative Hortrrerp, 1,990?<br>dmiral Rickover, Yes, sir; 1,990 megawatt-days per ton average,<br>n a reactor, the maximum burnup is about four times the average,<br>So you must be careful when you question people about megawatt-<br>days per ton that you ask them, “Are you talking about the average<br>or the maximum burnup ?”</p>
<p>epresentative Honirrenp, In other words, some of the rods last<br>longer than others?<br>iral Rickover, Yes, sir; as you know, the megawatt-days per<br>ton burnup depends on the neutron flux; the flux distribution js like<br>that of a cosine curve. At the center there is a much higher burnup<br>than there is at the ends or sides of the core.</p>
<p>The largest maximum burnup which has been obtained to date<br>with natural uranium in any Operating reactor in the world, has been<br>at Shippingport. So, anyone who js quoting figures on costs and life<br>must inevitably base his estimates on Shippingport results. The<br>actual] Shippingport burnup figures are 1,990 mMegawatt-days per ton<br>average, with 8,770 megawatt-days per ton maximum,</p>
<p>presentative Horirenp. Relate this to the guarantee which an<br>merican manufacturer gives to a foreign purchaser.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovrr. The guarantees aro all made on the basis of<br>average figures. When a man comes around and tells you his reactor<br>core will be subjected to 10,000 or so megawatt-days per ton, he is<br>talking about average burnup figures, which means he is talking about</p>
<p>ires which are about five times as great as we have achieved in the</p>
<p>uippingport reactor in its 2 years of operation. With the present<br>core we would have to operate Shippingport for about 10 yearg to<br>prove out in an actual power reactor this 10,000 Megawatt-days per<br>ton burnup.<br>€presentative Horrrrenp, These new reactors are going to be dj f-<br>ferent from Shippingport, and, therefore, from a technological stand-<br>point, do you feel that this is why the fi ve-tines-life guarantee can<br>given? Or do you feel that this is based more on speculation than<br>it is based on analysis? .</p>
<p>iral Rickover, I can only say this, Mr. Holifield: If I were</p>
<p>&amp; contractor, I would not guarantee any such reactor. The Govern-</p>
<p>ment, because of its unlimited financial resources could. But as a<br>contractor I would not, if I were running a business, guarantee 10,000<br>average megawatt days per ton.</p>
<p>am certainly not father to all wisdom in this field. There are<br>many people who have looked into this matter. But from experience</p>

<p>Admiral Rickover. The plant was designed for 60,000 megawatts<br>electrical net output, which means about 67,000 to 68,000 gross, the<br>other 7,000 to 8,000 being used to service the plant itself. We have<br>generating capacity for 100,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>Representative Hourim.p, With the old core?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. With the old core. We purposely installed a<br>100,000-kilowatt turbogenerator instead of a 60,000 one because we<br>figured that some day we would get smart enough to design a core that<br>would give us 100,000 kilowatts. So when we started designing the<br>hew core we initially aimed at 100,000-kilowatt output. But after<br>proceeding a while it appeared we could obtain 150,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>The Shippingport roject is so important. for developing basic re-<br>actor information I thousht it, wise to take this subject up with Mr,<br>McCone, and he agreed, as did your committee, a year ago, that we<br>should proceed on the basis of a 150,000-kilowatt core.</p>
<p>So the real isstie now is how do we get the additional capacity to<br>dissipate the energy in excess of 100,000 kilowatts, That is the real<br>issue. The core which is presently installed was designed for 60,000<br>kilowatts. We installed generating capacity for 100.000 kilowatts,<br>with the idea we would learn more as we went along to enable us to<br>design a new core for 100,000 kilowatts,</p>
<p>ad we not. been so good in design we would not be here today. Our<br>trouble stems from the fact that we have done too well. That is why<br>we are in difficulty.</p>
<p>Chairman Anperson. Why do you propose a heat sink instead of<br>adding electric generating facilities ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We did not propose a heat sink originally,<br>Senator Anderson. Originally we proposed adding electrical generat-<br>ing capacity, not only an additional 50,000 kilowatts, but an additional<br>75,000 kilowatts, because we figured we might run into the same<br>problem later on—that on the third core we could get even more than<br>150,000 kilowatts,</p>
<p>’ We wanted to be prepared for future improvements, In view of<br>the stringincy of Government funds and for other reasons, such as the<br>problems connected with an intrast ate utility and a number of other<br>technical and legal problems. the Commission decided, and I agreed<br>with them, that we should approach the Duquesne Light Co. to see<br>whether they would supply the additional 75,000-kilowatt generating<br>capacity at their expense,</p>
<p>ou must realize that of all reactor contractors working with the<br>AEC, Duquesne has been a most generous financial contributor. They<br>have already put in $20 million of their own money on generating<br>facilities. In addition they are paying for about 100 of the employees<br>who are manning the Shippingport station.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they contributed about $5 million toward the develop-<br>ment and construction of the plant itself. I believe these are pretty<br>good indications of generous interest by a private utility company.</p>
<p>From their standpoint—they are, as vou know, an intrastate utility<br>With no customers outside the State of Pennsylvania—they have done<br>an outstanding job in cooperating with the Government.</p>
<p>537596012</p>
<p>172 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION FISCAL YEAR 1961</p>
<p>When’ we ask them to put in an additional $23 million or so, that is<br>another matter. You can understand the natural reluctance of an<br>‘ intrastate utility such as Duquesne to spend that much more money.<br>So when the Commission asked me to develop this problem with<br>Duquesne, I went to Mr. Fleger, the chairman of their board. He<br>came up with the figure of about $23 million for the cost of an addi-<br>tional 75,000-kilowatt gross nerating capacity. Of this $23 million,<br>$8 million was for additional transmission faci ities.</p>
<p>Representatve Horirrep. How much was that figure?</p>
<p>&#x27; ‘Admiral Rrcxover. $5 million for the transmission facilities, which<br>would havé to go in to be able to transmit the electricity to the city of<br>Pittsburgh. eir plans at the present time do not include generating<br>additional electricity from the Shippingport direction,</p>
<p>’ Representative Hortrrety. The existing lines could not carry it?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct; and they figured that this $5<br>million cost for transmission line expansion was a proper charge to<br>make.</p>
<p>They estimated $18 million for the additional cost of the generating<br>plant. Their pro sal amounted essentially to this: They would<br>_ supply the sum o $23 million, and they wanted a contract to last<br>10 to 15 years so they would amortize the $23 million. Their proposal,<br>essentially, amounted to the Government paying 6 percent interest<br>annually on $23 million.</p>
<p>This was the real substance of the Duquesne proposal. In addition<br>to that, they asked for guarantees from the Government on reactor<br>output and on total yearly power generation. If we did not meet<br>these guarantees requested by Duquesne, we would be obligated to<br>make them up financially.</p>
<p>Shippingport being a research and development plant, we obviously<br>could not go along with such a proposal. So the Commission ap-<br>pointed an AEC I oard to look into the matter. The Board recom-<br>mended against its acceptance. Mr. McCone then requested that I<br>go back to Mr. Fleger to see if I could get better terms.</p>
<p>Duquesne stated they could not give us any better terms in view<br>of the large sum of mone they had already invested. Then it<br>was decided to go back to Duquesne and ask if they would, at their<br>expense, put up a heat sink, similar to a condenser. They said they<br>would do this, and that it would cost approximately $4 million.<br>They could be willing to put up the $4 million, and to charge ap-<br>proximately 6 percent interest, but the Government would not have<br>to make any performance guarantees of any kind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the end of a 5-year eriod, which they were going<br>to use to amortize this heat sink, the heat sink would belong to the<br>Government. J tink this was an eminently reasonable proposal. But<br>from the standpoint of the Government, after the Commission<br>looked into it, it appeared that it would be cheaper for the Govern-<br>ment to put the heat sink up itself. This is where this matter<br>stands now.</p>

<p>NUCLEAR SUBMARINE</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Admiral, &#x27;this is not directly on the point of your<br>testimony ‘just. now, but it is certainly a related matter. While all<br>the attention has been focused on the missile gap, I have been equally<br>concerned with the submarine threat. From the state of reactor<br>development which Congressman Holifield and Congressman Van<br>Zandt witnessed in the Soviet Union several months ago, from the<br>launching of the icebreaker, I have been concerned that perhaps they<br>had the capacity for a nuclear submarine, with the multiplication of<br>their submarine threat and possible development of missile capability<br>from submarines.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you if you share my view or if you can discusg<br>it in open session, if you obtained any information while you were</p>
<p>there, which led you to believe, as I have been led to believe, that:</p>
<p>the Soviets perhaps have such capability ?</p>
<p>‘I do not want to be specific in my questions, because I do not<br>want to be in the position of eliciting any classified information.<br>But if you have any observations on this line, I would be pleased to<br>receive them. &#x27;</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. Senator Gore, I cannot, of course, go into<br>detail, as you yourself recognize, on specific questions about our missile<br>or submarine strength in an open meeting.</p>
<p>Senator Gorw. I have not asked specific questions,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I understand, sir. I&#x27;can tell you this, and<br>this has been testified to before by myself and by other Navy wit-<br>nesses: That the Russians are estimated to have about 450 submarines<br>at the poecrit time, the majority of them being oceangoing subma-<br>rines; that they have the capacity to construct about 100 submarines<br>&amp; year, so<br>«There is no question in my mind, or, I am sure, in the mind of<br>anyone who is knowledgable in this field, that they are making</p>
<p>Strenuous attempts to develop a nuclear submarine capability. J<br>understand when Mr, Khrushchey visited Camp David he was quite<br>interested in seeing the motion pictures of our nuclear submarines<br>breaking through the ice,</p>
<p>you know, another of our nuclear submarines, the Sargo, punched<br>through the ice at the North Pole just a few daysago. Ifthe Russians<br>wished, they could in 5 years or so have more nuclear-powered sub-<br>marines than we have, if they make up their minds to build them on a<br>priority basis.</p>
<p>Senator Gorz. Would you say that again?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I said in 5 years or so———</p>
<p>Senator Gorn. Mr, Chairman, I cannot hear the witness.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It is my opinion, and 1 am not necessarily re-</p>
<p>flecting the views of the Defense istablishment, that in about 5 years<br>they can have more nuclear submarines operating than we.</p>
<p>n my opinion, we are frittering away a lead in perhaps the only<br>weapons system in which we are ahead. We are not taking advantage<br>of our lead by building enough nuclear submarines at the present</p>

And it would depend to what degree they are will-<br>ing to sacrifice other activities; would it not?<br>Admiral Rickover.

However, in their military sector, they do not use<br>less manpower than we do. . fom<br>‘Senator Aiken. How does our capacity to build compare with<br>theirs ?<br>Admiral Rickover. We do not have the capacity to build as many as<br>they, but we do have the capacity to build many more than we are<br>bibdingy now. Mr. Van Zandt discussed that with me the other day.<br>I believe that we could easily build 10 additional attack submarines<br>a year.

<p>Chairman Anperson. I reverse the order.</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to have protocol here,<br>Tinsist I yielded only for a question.</p>
<p>Chairman Anperson. [ never served in the Navy, so Tam happy<br>to haye my proper classification and order of preference straightened<br>out.</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Mr, Chairman, I would like to ask one more question<br>of the admiral.</p>
<p>Coming as it does from a layman, do you share the concern I have<br>felt that a fleet of several hundred submarines with missile capability</p>
<p>Might pose a threat at Jeast equal to the threat of ICBM&#x27;s?</p>
<p>Adiniral Rickover. 1 believe that at the present time the ballistic<br>missile launching submarine is the best deterrent we have, Asa inat~<br>ter of interest, T just came back this morning from the trials of our<br>second Polaris submarine, the Patrick Henry.</p>
<p>Since what we are really discussing is our freedom, that is a pretty<br>good name for the ship. Her trials were successful. Before the end<br>of the year the Navy expects to have the George Washington, the<br>first Polaris submarine, and the Patrick Henry, on station.</p>
<p>IT do not think it would be at all necessary to have hundreds of<br>Polaris submarines, because each of these subinarines has 16 missile<br>tubes. T understand that. in consequence of Senator Anderson’s re-<br>quest, the entire committee will have the opportunity to visit the<br>George Washington, going to sea in her, over the weekend of the</p>
<p>— 9th and 10th of April. So you will see for yourselves the tremendous</p>
<p>deterrent each Polaris submarine constitutes,</p>
<p>I do not believe hundreds ure necessary. Only nine are authorized<br>at the present time, with three additional requested in fiscal 1961.<br>J understand the Navy may ask for an additional number, three or<br>more, for fiscal 1961, ;</p>
<p>Senator Gorr. You have said that in your view the submarines with<br>ballistic capability were our best counterthreat. I ask you about<br>the threat to our own shores.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. From such weapons?</p>
<p>Senator Gorr. From such Weapons in the hands of a potential<br>enemy.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That definitely is the case, sir. The Russians,<br>according to information. which has been made public, have sub-<br>marines which can fire missiles a minimum of 200 miles, perhaps as<br>great as 800 miles, ;</p>
<p>With a missile range such as that, their submarines could easily<br>destroy about 70 percent of our manufacturing capacity, because it is<br>mostly concentrated along our coasts. That threat definitely exists.<br>The reason that Captain—and T hope he soon makes admiral—Van<br>Zandt was interested in asking for additional attack submarines, 10<br>a year, was to try to counter that threat, because the best way to com-</p>
<p>t an enemy submarine, particularly a nuclear submarine, is by our<br>own nuclear submarines,</p>
<p>ne</p>
<p>al a a</p>
<p>176 AEC AUTHORIZING, LEGISLATION FISCAL YEAR 1961</p>
<p>That was the basis for Mr. Van Zandt’s desire to build 10 more at-<br>tack submarines a year, above and beyond the number currently being<br>requested.</p>
<p>oes that answer your question, sir?</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Well, I think you intended to, but I wanted you to<br>be a little more specific, if you could, by way of comparison,</p>
<p>With the present state of ballistic missiles in stockpiles, insofar as<br>we know it, do you regard the potential threat from submarines with<br>ballistic oxpabilaty as great to the United States as the ICBM threat</p>
<p>may be?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rickxover. Again, talking for myself, Senator Gore, I<br>think it is even greater, because at the present time, due to the existing<br>imperfections in missiles, and, of course, this will be rectified, the<br>missile with a shorter range is easier to fire and certainly would be<br>more accurate than one with a greater range.</p>
<p>It is an easier job to fire a short-range missile than it is a long-<br>range missile. This is where the use of the subinarine comes in.<br>Assuming, for example, the Russians had 100 submarines lying off<br>the east: coast ; they could fire missiles, say, at the 200- or 300-mile<br>range. There is certainly more of a chance of hitting a target at a<br>short range than there is at a long range. The missiles are not as<br>large and the problems not as great.</p>
<p>enator Gort. Thank you.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I have just one question along this line,<br>Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>Would you judge in general that possessing a well-rounded nuclear<br>submarine fleet would be of greater value to the U.S.S.R. or the<br>United States?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It would be of greater value to the U.S.S.R.<br>than to the United States for the simple reason that it is almost in-<br>conceivable the people of this country would initiate a war.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am thinking from the standpoint of de-<br>terrence, and so forth, the general objectives of the country.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. From a physical standpoint, they would be<br>better off because their industry and their population are not as<br>concentrated as ours. In fact, for several years they have been de-<br>liberately planning, and they are succeeding in decentralizing both<br>their industrial and their scientific and development. facilities.</p>
<p>We have talked a great deal about doing the same but we have not<br>done anything so far. I doubt, with our national optimism, we will<br>do anything about it.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I included in my question a well-rounded<br>fleet, and that would bring up our attack submarines to counter their<br>missile submarines.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I tried to summarize my answer to your ques-<br>tion, sir. I think they would always have some advantage from the<br>fact that they would not be as vulnerable because of the dispersion<br>of their warmaking potential.</p>
<p>The other point is the one of national intention. I do not believe<br>the national intention of the United States to go to war with another</p>
<p>country would be anywhere near as great as for another country to</p>
<p>go to war with us.</p>

<p>FUNDS FOR PROJECT ROVER</p>
<p>There appeared in the Wall Street Journal this morning an edi- eae</p>

<p>I wonder if you would comment on this article a little bit. Tt lea ves<br>the impression that the AEC budget. is one that ean be reduced and<br>shrunk several million dollars whenever anybody requires it. Tt was<br>my impression that this represented some real sacrifices on the part<br>of AEC, and a real, sincere effort on the purt of AEC to try to meet<br>a national situation. I thought T would like to have your comments,<br>if T might, on the record, for this meet ing.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. Yes, Tf you will recall, Senator Anderson, our<br>original request. for money was reduced by about $13 million, as I<br>remember.</p>
<p>Chairman ANperson. That was for project Rover.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. Yes, It was reduced by the Bureau of the Budget<br>after consultation with NASA, the using agency, because the schedule<br>for progress on Rover appeared to NASA to be out of phase with the<br>then schedule of the Saturn project, and Rover was to be an upper<br>stage of Saturn.</p>
<p>They argued that. the project. could be decelerated somewhat and<br>brought along more jn consonance with Saturn. Later the President<br>authorized $195 million, or $135 million additional money, for NASA<br>which, among other things, accelerated the Saturn project.</p>
<p>I went to the Bureau of the Budget and asked for a restoration of<br>the funds on the ground that there was a new phasing and we had to<br>proceed with Rover in keeping with the new Saturn program ; there-<br>fore, we wanted to reestablish the original program which we had<br>requested.</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Budget came back and said that they were<br>Sympathetic with that, they would approve the authorization, but<br>they asked if we could find the money hy reapportioning nioney from<br>other sources, J told this committée in two hearings, T believe, of<br>that decision, and snid that T felt it was my Obligation and our obliga-<br>tion to see whether we did have funds fron; some sources, fron) reserves,<br>or from projects which we were carrying forward at a little less cost<br>than our estimate,</p>
<p>IT thought that was the first thing to do. If we could not find the<br>money, we would then go to the Bureau of the Budget. We found<br>money from severa] sources,</p>
<p>In the first place, the Euratom research and development program<br>had not. taken the money that was appropriated by several million<br>dollars, and, therefore, we moved $3 million from that project over<br>to the operati ng cost for Project Rover.</p>
<p>Tn 1958 and 1959 we had authorization and *ppropriations for mis-<br>cellaneous development. work and added projects for the Eniwetok<br>Proving Grounds that we could take $4.4 million for transfer to Project</p>
<p>over.</p>
<p>There was a similar situation at the National Reactor ‘Festing<br>Station for electrical distribution. Tt appears that the scope of our<br>work has changed somewhat and there is a saving of $1.7 million,<br>We moved tha t, too,</p>
<p>There was also the Tonopah Test Range project, a proposed 1961<br>project, which We, upon study, decided wo would not hive to proceed<br>with, and that provided $1.9 million.</p>

<p>In total, from those projects, we recovered the $8 million that was<br>EX . needed for the construction work in Nevada, and from the<br>Euratom program we gathered up the $8 million for operations.</p>
<p>That established the level of funding at $21 million.</p>
<p>I think it is not unusual in a budget of $284 billion for a current,<br>year and for a prior year to be able to, by a little careful screening of<br>what you are oing, find money in this order.

<p>Mr. McConr. That is right. After all, you are running $7 billion<br>worth of facilities and 110,000 men, and there are bound to be changes<br>that come up day to day and week to week.</p>
<p>That is the way this money was found. I do not. feel that this</p>

<p>You folks got turned down for any money for the period of<br>scientific work, and somebody else picks up $40 million a year to carry<br>it on. I think after that it is a harsh thing to say that the Atomic<br>Energy Commission might have been loose in finding $3 million or $4<br>million to work out what man y of us find to be an attractive proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. As you know, the Commission is enthusiastic in its<br>support of the Rover project. We think it is one of the very promising<br>projects we have underway.</p>
<p>Chairman Anverson, | know it is. I Say again, if it is delayed, it<br>has been delayed by the work of another agency and not the Atomic</p>
<p>nergy Commission.</p>
<p>Again, in open session, I want to commend the chairman, the mem-<br>bers of the Commission and their ofticials, for working as well as you<br>have to see that adequate funds are ready for Rover. This promises<br>to be an extremely fine development. I&#x27;am glad you stuck by your<br>gins,</p>

<p>ALTERATIONS ‘ro SHIPPINGPORT REACTOR FACILITIES</p>
<p>Representative Hosarer. The ad hoe advisory committee report of</p>
<p>‘ebruary 15, in its Sununary, after stating that the core 2 represents</p>
<p>significant improvements and advances and should yield substantially<br>valuable results, says—</p>
<p>We have been assured that planning and developmental work on core 2 with a</p>
<p>rating of 150 megawatts has already proceeded so far as to render moot the<br>question of undertaking core 2 with a somewhat lower rate. We feel bound to<br>say, however, that the review the committee was able to make did not convince<br>them that the increased costs were warranted by the technical advantages of a<br>rating above 100 megawats for which generating equipment is already installed,</p>
<p>That subjects both you and Mr. McCone, Admiral Rickover, to<br>criticism, and I think’ the committee, itself. I would like to have<br>something on the record that will at least, give us somewhat of a skirt-<br>cleaning job.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I really must hold myself back to answer this<br>question, because in my experience I have never found a committee<br>that could do a job. You know the old expression that 2 committee<br>cannot paint a picture, and that is exactly the situation you have<br>here.</p>
<p>You will also find that this committee recommended stil] another<br>committee, and Tam sure that that committee Will recommend still<br>another committee, because we certainly want do not want te put com<br>miltees out of business,</p>

<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION FISCAL YEAR 1961 181</p>
<p>Representative Honirrmecp. I just want to keep the record straight</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Your authority derives from the Constitution.<br>The other committees derive their authority from Government ex-<br>penditures. There is quite a difference. So there is no comparison.<br>You are performing a legal function which, of course, you should, and<br>we could not have our form of government if you did not.</p>
<p>But I do not see how people who have not been immersed in highly<br>technical problems, such as this, spend a short time ona problem and<br>make valid technical decisions,</p>
<p>Today these technical matters are highly complex. They involve<br>thousands of hours of computing-machine time, the work of thousands<br>of scientists and engineers. Noman can sit down and look at a reactor<br>design and arbitrarily say, “This is what we ought to do.” We have<br>never found that to be the case,</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You can say categorically that the benefits<br>to be gained from running this above 100 megawatts are worth the<br>expense ¢</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Absolutely, sir. 1 think if you did not do it<br>this way, you would be obliged to build a completely new large reactor.<br>All of us are interested in saving money and in using the talent we have<br>as economically as possible.</p>
<p>I will make another categorical statement: I think today if you<br>wanted to be wise in spending money, you would pick out the success-<br>ful development groups in any field, whether they are in rockets,<br>missiles, reactors, and you would load them up as much as they per-<br>mitted you to load them. No man who is really dedicated to his<br>project will undertake developments he does not believe in.</p>
<p>The surest way to have a successful project is to let a man who be-<br>heves in it work his head off doing it. That is the only way you can<br>do it. You are people who are involved in the field of polities, and</p>
<p>ou know from your political sense that you can only get things done<br>»y and through people, by judging who are the right people. That is<br>all you can do; there is no other wiry,</p>
<p>Representative Hossrer. Thank you, Admiral,</p>
<p>I was going to ask if you were going to appoint the second commit-<br>tee, but T will not do it now, Mr. MeCone.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. I would like to comment on that particular paragraph<br>in the report because it. was given serious consideration by the Commis-<br>sion in a formal meeting,</p>
<p>We concluded that there Were reasons quite beyond the considera-<br>tions of this Advisory Committee which would prompt us to pursne<br>the development of core No, 2 at 150 megawatts. This was not made<br>lightly. It was seriously considered,</p>
<p>There were some of the technical questions in core design and power<br>density that could be proven, to be sure, with a 100-megawatt core.<br>But all of the things we sought, including the demonstration of the</p>
<p>eapacity of the plant as a whole, could only be done if the core were<br>brought up to 150 megawatts. For that reason, we disagreed with our<br>Advisory Committee and, incidentally, we disagree with our Advisory<br>Committee quite often. ;</p>
<p>Sometimes the Commission haa to consider responsibilities quite<br>beyond the terms of reference of the particular committee,</p>
<p>tepresentative Hontrimnn. T do not think you have to have any fear<br>at all that this committee is not completely behind bringing this up to</p>

<p>150 megawatts and getting some operational experience at that for the<br>period of time that it is necessary to develop the statistics that we need<br>on fuel elements and other factors that are involved.</p>
<p>f would like to address myself, if I might, to the question of furnish-<br>ing this additional capacity. .</p>
<p>What was the deciding factor on their part against this? Was it<br>the interruptibility of service or was it the 8-mills per kilowatt-hour<br>that we were charging them 4</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No; the idea was that this was an additional<br>large investment on Duquesne’s part and they felt that they had<br>ulready made the most significant financial investment of any utility<br>company in the nuclear field. They did not feel it was incumbent on<br>them to provide more money to improve the art.</p>
<p>They were quite willing to put up the facilities and charge the<br>Government a 6-percent interest rate, plus getting governmental guar-<br>antees of uninterrupted service. This uninterrupted service is not.<br>compatible with the research and development we are trying to do at<br>Shippingport.</p>
<p>Representative Horirrenp. 1 understand. ‘That is why I wondered<br>if this was&#x27;a primary factor in their consideration. If they do need<br>additional kilowatts in their system, and if they have to build con-<br>ventional plants to obtain those kilowatts, and if we could furnish<br>«iditional kilowatts from this plant at an attractive price to them, I<br>wonder if that. was explored.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hontvrep. In other words, even a reduetion in price<br>of the kilowatts?</p>
<p>Admiral Rioxover. Yes; “t was explored. The basic reason, as T<br>understand it, is that as far as Duquesne is concerned, Shippingport<br>is a standby plant. Duquesne has about 1,200,000 kilowatts of in-<br>stalled capacity. What they get out of the Shippingport plant is a<br>sinall part of the total.</p>
<p>Representative Honirietp. So the investment of $23 million for an<br>muetruptible supply from their standpoint would not be economic,<br>particularly in the view that it is interruptible?</p>
<p>Admiral] Rickover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hotrrimip. Would the heat sink arrangement which<br>is going to cost—is it $9 million ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. $4 million ora little less, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Honirieiy. Will that give you the sane ability to ob-</p>
<p>tain operational data on your reactor as if it were attached /</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. It will be completely equivalent. In<br>fact, it will be even better because we will not be tied into an outside<br>demand for power. We can just use the heat sink as we wish. There<br>is no reduction in our ability to obtain data. In fact, it will be<br>enhanced.</p>
<p>Representative Horirrecp. Because you can interrupt it at will and<br>have no obligation at all for furnishing in-line power?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Representative Houtrreip. I wanted to ask you about one item<br>which I noticed was asked for, “Reactor modification to enable the<br>prototype plant,” for $5.6 million. This was denied by the Bureau of<br>the Budget.</p>
<p>The item is for reactor modification to naval prototype plants,<br>$5.6 million. Are you acquainted with that?</p>
<p>Mr. Lurpecke. Yes, sir. This item was not submitted to the Bu-<br>reaul as a construction project; it was included in our estimates for<br>the “Operating expenses” appropriation in the amount of costs an-<br>ticipated in fiscal year 1961.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes; that is not an y problem for us.</p>
<p>ALTERATIONS TO SHIPPINGPORT REACTOR FACILITIES</p>
<p>May I say one more thing about the Shippingport reactor? I hope<br>we get authority or at Jeast an understanding that the committee looks<br>favorably or unfavorably ou it because we have to go ahead with<br>architect engineering. We have certain funds which we could legally<br>use to get started.</p>
<p>Representative Horirreip. I think I would be out of place to make<br>any kind of a firm commitment, but I believe I ean express the general<br>feeling of the committee that, they want you to go ahead with this<br>operation at Shippingport, which would indicate approval of this by<br>the committee.
