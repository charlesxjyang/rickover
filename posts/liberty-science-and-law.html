      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1970 acceptance speech for The Washington Award Medal, Vice Admiral H.G. Rickover explores the intricate relationship between &quot;Liberty, Science, and Law,&quot; positing that while technology offers immense benefits, its uncontrolled application threatens human freedom, traditional values, and the environment. Rickover asserts that technology, as a human creation, must be subject to ethical control and law, not allowed to dictate human purpose. He draws historical parallels from ancient Athens&#x27;s democratic ideals to the Renaissance&#x27;s intellectual awakening, warning against unchecked &quot;progress&quot; that leads to environmental degradation, resource depletion (citing examples like whaling and strip mining), and the erosion of human dignity. Rickover advocates for engineering to become a &quot;learned profession&quot; like medicine, bound by ethical codes to prioritize human welfare, and stresses the urgent need for public understanding and robust legal frameworks to ensure technology serves, rather than diminishes, liberty for future generations.</p>

<p>To be a recipient of the award established in George Washington&#x27;s<br>name moves me deeply.</p>
<p>I was honored and pleased when I learned you considered my work<br>worthy of the ideals of the Washington Award Medal, and of the high<br>standards you established in selecting my distinguished predecessors.<br>It gave me a special sense of satisfaction that could hardly be matched<br>by any other recognition.</p>
<p>I have always felt that in honoring a person we must remember that<br>all human achievement flows not only from individual effort but from<br>associative effort as well. We, the living, are heirs to all the ideas</p>
<p>and accomplishments of every human being who has ever lived. Nowhere is</p>
<p>this more true than in the never-ending quest for new knowledge, and fr</p>
<p>new ways to put this knowledge to practical use. By its very nature,</p>
<p>this is a cooperative endeavor.</p>

<p>made such a4 contribution in the past, I only hope I can continue to add</p>
<p>meaningfully to it, and thereby more fully merit the honor you have so</p>
<p>graciously bestowed on me.</p>
<p>In view of the current public, legislative, and engineering interest<br>in our environment, I thought it would be fitting to speak on LIBERTY ,<br>SCIENCE AND LAW. I use the term science in its proad connotation which<br>includes’ engineering and t echnology- My object is to show the implica-<br>tions of scientific and technological developments for human rights and<br>fundamental freedom. ; |</p>
<p>In 1966 I had the honor and privilege of addressing the Athens Meeting<br>of the Royal National Foundation in Greece. I spoke on the Hill of the<br>Pnyx, the place where the ancient Ecclesia had its seat, where men first<br>practiced the difficult art of self-government , succeeding prilliantly<br>for a time, but failing in the end. Our country, as you know, picked up<br>the torch of liberty they had lighted and established the first<br>representative democracy in modern times, even as Athens had established<br>the first direct democracy in all history.</p>
<p>Twenty-four centuries separated these two great innovative acts in<br>time, over five thousand miles in spacee One took place in a small</p>
<p>city-state possessing few material resources, the other in a huge country -</p>
<p>of great natural wealth. Yet there is a close inner link between them.<br>They had the same objective. The principles they adopted to achieve their<br>purpose were similar. Both sought to create--and did create--the<br>political framework for a society of free men.</p>
<p>The framers of the American Constitution of 1789 drew upon Greek<br>political theory and practice, adopting what had proved successful,<br>ingeniously improving where the earlier structure had shown weakness.</p>
<p>They were men of the Enlightenment, when classical rationalism sparked a<br>new Age of Reason throughout the western world; when philosophers were<br>inspired to mount an attack on every custom and institution. that shackles<br>the mind of man and arbitrarily restrains his actions--from superstition<br>to class privilege, from tyranny by an established church to tyranny by a<br>secular autocrat. The political institutions of all the nations of the<br>free world today--beginning with ours--haa@ their inception in the turmoil<br>of that last phase of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Western civilization is set apart from civilizations elsewhere, both<br>past and present, by its dynamism, its extraordinary creativity, its<br>intense preoccupation with things of the mind. All this started with the<br>Renaissance. Not until modern western man rediscovered and retrieved his<br>classical heritage did he begin to outstrip the rest of the world.</p>
<p>To borrow a Churchillian phrase, it can be said of Athens, of Greece<br>in general, that never before or since did so few human beings leave so<br>deep and lasting an imprint on so many others, differing in race and faith,<br>distant in time and space from this cradle of western civilization. Their</p>
<p>mark is on all our science, our art, architecture, literature, theater,</p>
<p>mG on our political thinking and practice as well. The Athenians proved<br>that free men could govern themselves; that it was possible to live in a<br>civilized society without having to relinquish personal freedom.</p>
<p>This was an epochal achievement. In all his long life on earth, man</p>
<p>has had but brief moments of freedom. His own nature is the cause of the</p>
<p>paradoxical situation that civilization and liberty are interdependent,<br>yet at the same time antithetical. One cannot be had without the other,</p>
<p>yet reconciling them remains to this day what it has always been--the most<br>difficult political, social, and economic problem. . 7</p>
<p>Civilization and liberty are interdependent because basic to freedom<br>is exercise of mind and spirit, of the faculties that set us apart from<br>other living things and make us fully human. For this there must be a<br>modicum of leisure which comes only with civilization, when men no longer<br>need devote all their time and energy to appeasement of hunger and<br>protection against the elements--as must the animals.</p>
<p>But release from endless toil for mere survival does not automatically<br>set men free. Indeed, the. very opportunity to cultivate mind and spirit</p>
<p>which civilization opens to man lies at the root cf the antithesis between</p>
<p>civilization and liberty, for this opportunity is not seized to the same<br>degree by everyone.</p>
<p>Always and everywhere, civilization results in much greater enlargement<br>of the scope of human thought and action among the minority possessing high<br>intelligence than among the majority of average people. Nature endows men</p>
<p>with unequal capacities for acquiring knowledge and competence. More so in</p>
<p>‘the realm of the intellect, which is all-important in civilized life,</p>
<p>fnan in the realm of physical strength and courage, which counts most in<br>primitive society. Men become, as it were, more unequal as civilization<br>adwances.</p>
<p>Life grows complex, harder to understand for ordinary people,<br>demanding competencies many are unable to acquire. In understanding and<br>competence, the gifted swiftly forge ahead. what they achieve is beyond<br>the capacity of the average. The result is that men grow apart, their<br>interests diverge. Society tends to divide into segments according to<br>superiority of competence or superiority of numbers. The temptation is<br>great for each seqment to use the power, its particular superiority confers<br>to bend the whrle of society to its will, thus putting an end to freedom.</p>
<p>The Athenians were first to devise a political system that preserved<br>the citizen&#x27;s liberty by counteracting the natural human inequalities<br>which are the root cause of segmented power centers. The basic principles<br>of their system remain to this day the best protection of individual<br>freedom. Government of the people, by the people, and for the people was<br>their great invention; political equality their‘ crowning achievement.</p>
<p>They inaugurated the reign of mind over force by providing for resolution<br>of differences in point of view and interest through public dialogue<br>leading to consensus, instead of by the exercise of power. Ferhaps the<br>most remarkable feature of their polity was that it engaged the continuous<br>participation in public business of a large part of the citizenry--<br>somewhere between one fifth ana one fourth at any given time. It was</p>
<p>obvious to them that only when the people are personally involved with</p>
<p>their government will public officials be responsive to the popular will.</p>
<p>Atimens who shunned public service were called idiotes ana considered<br>e=seless; in some cases, failure to do one&#x27;s public duty resulted in loss<br>o= civil rights.</p>
<p>To quote Edith Hamilton, the American classicist who was made an<br>monorary citizen of Athens, &quot;the idea of the Athenian state was 4 union<br>of individuals free to develop their own powers and live their own way,<br>obedient only to the laws they passed themselves and could criticize and<br>change at will.&quot; This is the political ideal that to western man spells<br>liberty and that is rejected in toto by all autocracies, modern as well as<br>ancient.</p>
<p>The Greeks, 1 think, understood better than most of us what it means<br>to be free. In his play, The Persians, Aeschylus who fought at Marathon<br>puts his finger unerringly on what distinguished free Greece from unfree<br>Persia. He has the Queer of Persia ask about the Athenians: &quot;who is<br>their master?&quot; To which she received the answer, &quot;they are not subject to<br>any man&quot;; they obey only the law. When she is told of her son&#x27;s defeat,<br>the Queen remarks: &quot;Even if he fail, there is no jaw can call him to<br>account.&quot; How better could one express the contrast between the<br>protagonists in today&#x27;s cold war?</p>
<p>Liberty, never gained without enormous effort and sacrifice, is all<br>too easily lost. Those who enslave their own people seem irresistibly<br>driven to extinguish freedom everywhere. When we understand them, we are<br>better prepared to ward off their aggression. More important still is</p>
<p>awareness of the forces within free societies that endanger liberty. in</p>
<p>both respects, there is still much we can learn from the Athenians.</p>
<p>I will discuss certain developments in modern democracies that have an<br>e@mwerse effect upon the liberties of the individual and the social and<br>moral welues cherished by free men. The causative factor of this new<br>threat to liberty is science and science-based technology. |</p>
<p>This new science-technological threat is but the latest version of the<br>age-old conflict between civilization and liberty--a conflict that has no<br>permanent solution but reappears perennially in new form.</p>
<p>Liberty is never gained for once and for all. Each generation must<br>win it anew. Each must defend it against new perils. These perils arise<br>because men, being endowed with free. will, continually alter the conditions<br>of life. Countless decisions made in pursuit of private objectives may so<br>transform society that institutional safequards once adequately protecting<br>human liberty become ineffective. It is then necessary to return to first<br>principles and to adapt them to altered circumstances.</p>
<p>| The title of my speech--LIBERTY, SCIENCE AND LAW--expresses my<br>conviction that unless certain practices in the technological exploitation</p>
<p>of scientific knowledge are restrained by law, they will cost us our</p>
<p>- liberties.</p>
<p>‘Science and technology are, of course, of immense benefit to man.<br>But they may bring about. changes in our physical environment of greatest<br>potential danger. Certain technologies admittedly injure man, society,<br>and nature. Yet, even in countries where the people are sovereign and<br>where they recognize the danger, efforts to bring these technologies under<br>social control have had little success. Those who have the use of</p>
<p>technology are powerful enough to prevent legal restraint, the main prop</p>
<p>of their power being the esoteric character of modern science.</p>
<p>Much of it is incomprehensible even to intelligent and educated<br>laymen. When scientific-technological considerations enter into<br>public issues--as is often the case today--the issues cannot be<br>understood by the electorate, frequently not even by the public officials<br>who are directly concerned. There is then no recourse but to call on<br>scientists for expert advice. In effect, the issue will be decided<br>by them, yet they. have hot been elected, nor are they accountable to</p>
<p>What is left of self-government when public policy no</p>
<p>longer reflects ‘public consensus? And, when the public finds that it</p>
<p>cannot judge and evaluate issues involving science, will it not<br>become apathetic toward all public issues? Does this not spell the<br>doom of: self-government, hence of ‘freedom for modern manz Though<br>all the institutions established to safeguard his liberties may<br>remain ‘intact, the substance of freedom will have been lost. —</p>
<p>By one of those ironies of fate beloved of Greek dramatists,<br>this new threat to liberty has its source in the noblest Greek<br>achievement, the freeing of the human mind to roam at will in pursuit<br>of truth and knowledge. All things are to be examined and called<br>into question, said the Greeks. Unless men understood the world in<br>which they lived, and because of this understanding felt at home in it<br>and could be. useful citizens, they were not truly free. Never before<br>or since was intellectual freedom valued so greatly. &quot;All things were</p>
<p>in chaos when mind arose and made order,&quot; said Anaxagoras, the</p>
<p>mathematician and astronomer.</p>
<p>wen Renaissance man recovered his classical heritage, the most<br>mneciLous treasure he found was freedom of the mind. with his mental<br>powers set free, it took him put three and 2 half centuries to build<br>~_ foundations laid in classical Greece the whole magnificant<br>edifice of modern science. No one could have foreseen that in<br>its ultimate consequences the Scientific Revolution might diminish</p>
<p>ruman . liberty:</p>
<p>But. it has brought us back full circle. Science--the vital</p>
<p>area of knowledge today--is for most of us virtually 4 closed pock;<br>again it has become the monopoly of a small elite- This is not the<br>fault of the scientists. Unlike ancient priesthoods, they have no<br>wish to bar others from knowledge or to use it tc enslave the<br>ignorant. Many scientists make strenuous efforts to explain science<br>to the lay public. Nevertheless, we find ourselves in much the same<br>position as the ancient Egyptians whose very lives depended on knowing<br>when the waters of the Nile would rise and £a11--knowledge possessed<br>by their priesthood alone. |</p>
<p>As in the past, it is not the knowledge gap per se that is most<br>detrimental to freedom, not the fact that the majority cannot follow<br>scholars into the realm of higher mathematics and science; rather<br>it is the effect iqnorance of science has on public attitudes toward<br>science and science-based technolocy. The impact of technology,</p>
<p>in particular, on the individual and on society at large is profoundly</p>
<p>e@fected by prevailing concepts of what technology is and what purpose<br>Gt shoulc serve.</p>
<p>If people understood that technology is the creation of man,<br>@herei- =&lt; subject to human control, they would demand that it be<br>mwsed to produce maximum benefit and do minimum harm to individuals<br>ana to the values that make for civilized living. Unfortunately,<br>there is a tendency in contemporary thinking to ascribe to technology<br>a momentum of its own, placing it beyond human direction or restraint--<br>a tendency more pronounced in some countries but observable wherever</p>
<p>there is rapid technological progress.</p>
<p>It manifests itself in such absurd statements 4s that technology<br>demamds some action the speaker favors, Or that &quot;you can&#x27;t stop progress.&quot;<br>Fersonalizing abstractions is a favorite means of semantic misdirection;<br>it gives an air of authority to dubious statements. -iost people are<br>easily pressured by purveyors of technology into permitting so-called<br>progress to alter their lives, without attempting to control it--<br>as if they had to submit meekly to whatever is technically feasible.<br>If they reflected, they would discover that not evert .ing hailed as</p>
<p>progress contributes to happiness; that the new is not always better,</p>
<p>nor the old always outdated.</p>
<p>The notion is also widespread that, having wrought vast changes in</p>
<p>the material conditions of life, technology perforce renders obsolete</p>
<p>traditional concepts of ethics and morals, as well as accustomed ways of</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>sz political and social relationships. Earnest debates are</p>
<p>orremitle taking place whether it is possible to act morally in the</p>
<p>my thectmological society, and proposals have been made--quite seriously--<br>+met science must now replace traditional ethics! We have here 4<br>oonfesion that must be cleared up.</p>
<p>Through technology we are relieved of much brutal, exhausting,<br>ginysical labor as well as boring routine work; we are provided with<br>mune ous mechanical servants who do certain kinds of work faster, cheaper,<br>ema more efficiently than people. Why shoulda the ease and affluence<br>technology makes possible affect moral precepts that have guided western<br>man for ages This may brand me as old-fashioned but I have not yet<br>found occasion to discard a single principle that was accepted in the<br>america of my youth.</p>
<p>Technology is tools, techniques, procedures, things; the artifacts<br>fashioned by modern industrial man to increase his powers of mind and body.<br>Marvelous as they are, let us not be overawed by these artifacts. Certainly<br>they do not dictate how we should use them nor,+ by their’ mere existence,<br>go they authorize actions that were not anteriorly lawful. We alone bear</p>
<p>responsibility for our technology- In this, as in all our actions, we are</p>
<p>bound by the principles governing human behaviour in our society.<br>Does it make sense to abandon principles one has lived by because he<br>has acquired better tools? Tools are for utilizing the external resources</p>
<p>at our disposal; principles are for marshaling our inner, our human</p>
<p>resources. Tools enable us to alter our physical environment; principles<br>serve to order our personal life and our relations with others. The two</p>
<p>have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>il</p>
<p>@uis should be obvious, but erroneous concepts of science and<br>“eutimelogy abound because people tend to confuse the two. Not only in<br>thinking but even among the well-informed, science and technology</p>
<p>are mot always clearly distinguished. Characteristics pertaining to<br>Seiemce are frequently attributed to technology, even as science itself is<br>oamfounded with ethics. |</p>
<p>Science has to do with discovering the true facts and relationships of<br>observable phenomena in nature, and with establishing theories that serve<br>to organize masses of verified data concerning these facts and<br>relationships. By boring into the secrets of nature, scientists discover<br>keys that unlock powerful forces which can be made to serve man. It is<br>through technology that these forces are then put to human use.</p>
<p>Science is a body of systematized knowledge; technology is the</p>
<p>which knowledge is _practical use. The difference</p>
<p>is important.</p>
<p>Because of the care scientists take to verify the facts supporting<br>their theories, and their readiness to alter theories when new facts prove<br>them imperfect, science has acquired great authority. What the scientific<br>community accepts as proven is not questioned by the public. No one<br>disputes that the earth circles the sun, or that atomic fission produces<br>energy.</p>
<p>Technology cannot claim the authority of science and is therefore<br>properly a subject of debate, not alone by experts but by the public as<br>well. Little thought is customarily given to the possibility of harmful</p>
<p>aftereffects by those responsible for technological exploitation of</p>
<p>-weific kmowledge. In consequence, technology has proved anything but</p>
<p>bly beneficial. Indeed, much damage has been done because ho</p>
<p>yen to the interaction of technology with nature. More of</p>
<p>tie presently.</p>
<p>&amp; certain ruthlessness is encouraged, in the mistaken belief that to<br>#i{eregard human considerations is as necessary in technology as it is in<br>exiemee. The analogy is false.</p>
<p>Rigorous exclusion of the human factor is required by the methods of<br>science. These were developed to serve the needs of scientists, whose sole<br>anterest is to comprehend the universe; to know the truth; to know it<br>securately and with certainty. The searcher for truth cannot pay attention<br>to his own or other people&#x27;s likes and dislikes, or to popular ideas of the<br>fitness of things. What he discovers may shock or anger people--as did<br>Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. But even an unpleasant truth is worth having;<br>besides one can choose not to believe it! Science, being pure thought,<br>harms no one. |</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>Technology, on the other hand, is action, often potentially dangerous<br>action. Never has man possessed such enormous power to injure his fellow<br>humans and his society as has been put into his hands by modern technology.<br>This is why technology can have no Legitimate purpose but to serve man--man<br>4n general, not merely some men; future generations, not merely those who<br>currently wish to gain advantage for themselves; man in the totality of his<br>humanity, encompassing all his manifold 4nterests and needs, not merely some</p>
<p>one particular concern. Technology is not an end in itself; it is a means</p>
<p>to an end, the end peing determined by man himself in accordance with the</p>
<p>aC CO</p>
<p>laws prevailing in his society.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>4 word may be 4n order concerning the disparate meaning of the term</p>
<p>g on whether 4t is used in the ordinary gense--which 43 also</p>
<p>ze<br>cue ariginal sense of the word--or by scientists.</p>
<p>Lew, &amp;s commonly understood; refers to those rules of human conduct<br>grescribed and enforced by society. Its purpose is to resolve human<br>oumflicts by the application of definitive rules. These rules are always</p>
<p>Sebatable and can be changed when there is demand for 4 change.</p>
<p>The scientists have appropriated the term law to describe regularities<br>exhibited by physical phenomena --the rules by which the universe governs<br>atself. In the transition, the word has taken on a new meaning.</p>
<p>From the layman&#x27;s point of view, what the scientist calls law is fact,<br>rather than law--immutable fact. Or, if you prefer, 4t is law operating in<br>a sphere where human beings can exercise no influence. We cannot alter the<br>laws of the cosmos; we can only discover them. A law of science expresses<br>mechanical regularity where no choice of action, no free will comes into<br>play; it deals with constancy of behavior in nature. It nas relevance for<br>us because 4t makes the universe comprehensible and go enables us to<br>utilize the forces of nature for human purposes.</p>
<p>We are bound by the laws that science has disclosed when we exploit<br>these forces by means of technology - Likewise we are pound by the man-made<br>laws of our society, for our actions affect fellow human peings. Technology<br>straddles, as 4t were, the law of the universe and the law of man; it 1s</p>
<p>subject to poth.<br>‘Much confusion in popular thinking arises from this fact. “The two laws</p>
<p>are confounded. Or, to put it aifferently;, they are thought to be part of a2<br>single system of law_so that one_or the other must perforce take precedence</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Ewer since scientists discovered that the earth 4s not the center of<br>me aumiverse, &amp;5 had been maintained by the highest human authorities, we<br>iene been learning painfully that the laws of nature cannot be overturned</p>
<p>=, fiat. It has taken 4 long time to attain this rational attitude;</p>
<p>we ane now conscious of the consequences of intolerance ain the past.<br>Serhaeps this is why we are 50 tolerant toward those who claim the right to<br>gee technology as they see fit, and who treat every attempt by society to .<br>regulate such use in the public interest as af it were a modern repetition<br>ef the persecution of Galileo!</p>
<p>The rignt to be protected by law against injurious action by others is<br>basic to civilized society. Yet, opponents of legislation intended to<br>restrain use of potentially dangerous technologies are often able to prevent<br>or delay enactment of such laws py playing upon the layman&#x27;s respect for<br>seience. It 4s their common practice to argue as if at issue were 4 law of<br>seience when, in fact, what is peing considered is not science but the<br>advisability or legality of the technological exploitation of a scientific<br>discovery. The public would not be deceived by ‘such arguments 4f it clearly<br>understood the fundamental difference between science--which is knowledge~~<br>and technology--which is action based on knowledge -</p>
<p>To guard against peing misled, one should cultivate an attitude of<br>scepticism whenever the word science 4s used. Is 4t science that is being<br>discussed or is 4t technology? If technology, the question at once arises<br>whether the proposed action is legally permissible and socially desirable.<br>These are matters that lie outside the domain of science. Just as the law</p>
<p>of the cosmos cannot be overturned by human fiat, so is human law supreme</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>4ts own proper sphere of operation. Technology must therefore<br>‘eoeZor= to that most pasic of all human laws, the maxim of the &quot;mutuality<br>ef liberty,&quot; the principle that one man&#x27;s liberty of action ends where it<br>woulda injure another. without this maxim, freedom would be a barren<br>privilege.</p>
<p>whether or not a particular technology has harmful potentialities<br>should not be decided unilaterally by those who use it. The user is an<br>anterested party to the conflict between private and public interest that<br>every potentially haraful technology poses. Nearly always he is also @<br>practical man. 7</p>
<p>I think one can fairly say that the practical man&#x27;s approach is<br>short -range and private, concerned with ways to put scientific discoveries<br>to use in the most economic and efficient manner. Rarely will he give<br>thought to the long-range and public consequences of his actions, that is,<br>to the effects that &amp; new technology may have on people, on the nation, on<br>the world; on present and future generations.</p>
<p>To illustrate the disastrous consequences of a narrow practical<br>approach, let me give some examples of technological damage to our natura!<br>environment.</p>
<p>Carelessly emitted, the waste products of new technologies create &amp;<br>massive problem of soil, water and air pollution. We may be permanently<br>damaging the atmosphere by changing its chemical composition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we keep right on puilding things that belch great<br>quantities of junk into the atmosphere, with little or no regard for th:</p>
<p>consequences. Even now, living in Los Angeles or New York City means</p>
<p>acks of cigaretts 4 day! At the</p>
<p>w in the equivalent of five P</p>
<p>—t time truly clean air can only be found at the middle of the</p>
<p>American is the &quot;owner&quot; of nundreds of</p>
<p>We take pride that each<br>aking and disagreeable work in our</p>
<p>eal slaves who do the packbre</p>
<p>But we do not give thought to the fact that each of these</p>
<p>umemical slaves produces about the same amount of wastes as @ human.</p>
<p>dad should cause us to question what our</p>
<p>iis is &amp; sobering thought an<br>and its significance to</p>
<p>&quot; 43 doing to our environment,</p>
<p>go-called “progress</p>
<p>| =r posterity.<br>fitable to manufacturers and useful to consumers ,</p>
<p>i Mew products, pro<br>For instance, detergents</p>
<p>ere often themselves intractable pollutants.</p>
<p>| which unlike soap do not dissolve 4n water, or pesticides and weed killers<br>winch , carelessly applied, will poison soil, crops; pirds, animals, fish and</p>
<p>: ewentually man. |</p>
<p>Other technologies enable man to alter the very contours of the land--<br>es with new strip mining machinery - Huge chunks of earth and rock with |<br>their topsoil and vegetation are gouged out, changing fertile country into</p>
<p>cape--&amp; land robbed not only of its 4rreplaceable mineral</p>
<p>= desolate lunars</p>
<p>wealth but of 4ts fertility as well.</p>
<p>Man now has the means to slaughter all the wild animals on earth and</p>

<p>We witness at the moment the end of one of the saddest cases of misuse</p>

<p>‘apbed by truly effective 4nternational action, the great wh<br>victims of man&#x27;s &quot;practical&quot;</p>
<p>ales--the blue;</p>
<p>cme finback, the sperm--will goon disappear,</p>
<p>These and other whales once populated the high seas in 4mmense</p>
<p>mumbers. For hundreds of years whaling remained a reasonably fair contest</p>
<p>between man and the intelligent, swift -moving mammals he hunted. Modern</p>
<p>sechnology has turned it into prutal genocide. Blindly pursuing what</p>
<p>they doubtless consider an eminently practical objective --maximum profit</p>
<p>today --the whalers are wiping out the very resources that could insure them</p>
<p>a profit fomorrow.</p>
<p>zxomors=<br>Last year, Norway&#x27;s only whaling company announced that because the</p>
<p>number of whales allotted to 4t was so few it would make the operation of</p>
<p>4ts whaling fleet unprofitable; therefore they would not participate in</p>
<p>whaling this year. Even in 1966, Japanese ships had to return home after</p>
<p>only three of the normal five months at sea pecause they could find no</p>
<p>whales.<br>practical considerations aside, is anyone justified 4n using</p>
<p>technology to exterminate &amp; species that has existed on this earth for</p>
<p>eons--the largest animal the world has ever seen? Are we certain our</p>
<p>descendants may not at some future time have need of these mammals?</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>How we use technology profoundly affects the shape of our society. In</p>
<p>Me brief span of time--a century or so--that we have had a science-based<br>| gechnology what use have we made of it? We have multiplied inordinately,</p>
<p>wasted irreplaceable fuels and minerals and perpetrated incalculable and</p>
<p>4rreversible ecological damage. On the strength of our knowledge of nature,<br>we have set ourselves above nature. We presume to change the natural<br>environment for all the living creatures on this earth. Do we, who are<br>transients on this earth and not overly wise, really pelieve we have the<br>right to upset the order of nature, an order established by a power higher<br>than man? | Let us not be carried away by our victories over Nature. It<br>will take revenge for every such victory, .</p>
<p>These are complicated matters for ordinary citizens to evaluate and<br>decide. How in future to make wiser use of technology 18 perhaps the<br>paramount public issue facing the electorates of industrial countries. It<br>will tax their mental resources and challenge their political acumen.<br>Certain measures suggest themselves:</p>
<p>Experience shows that by itself, the legal maxim of &quot;the mutuality of<br>liberty&quot; will not prevent commitment to technoligies that may later prove<br>harmful. The maxim must be implemented by preventive public action--~action<br>of the kind that has long been operative in the field of public health.<br>There is need for laws requiring that before 4 particular technology may be<br>used, reliable tests must have been made to prove 4t will be useful and<br>safe. A few such laws have been enacted; more are needed.</p>
<p>I suggest that, as a special public service, engineers take on the<br>task of working for better protection against technological injury. This</p>
<p>is a new and fruitful area in which they could make important contributions</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>&quot; anler implementation of the traditional principle that injuring the health</p>
<p>go cman welfare--an area which requires no revolutionary change in the</p>
<p>miitical or economic structure of society, merely greater precision and</p>
<p>or causing the death of human peings is unlawful. The term health should<br>not be limited to physical health but should 4nclude psychic health and</p>
<p>protection of the human personality a8 well. New technologies based on</p>
<p>the uncertain &quot;science&quot; of the gocial sciences involve snooping into the<br>4nner recesses of the human mind, personality testing and pseudo-scientific<br>manipulation of human beings. When they are 4mposed as conditions of<br>employment or otherwise partake of an element of compulsion, these<br>technologies should be regulated or outlawed entirely. |</p>
<p>Much more thought should be given to technological interference with<br>the balance of nature and its consequences for man, present and future.<br>There is need of wider recognition that government has as nueh @&amp; duty to<br>protect the land, the air, the water, the natural environment against<br>technological damage, as it has to protect the country against foreign<br>enemies and the individual against criminals. Conversely; that every<br>citizen is duty bound to make an effort to understand how technology<br>operates, what are its possibilities, ite limitations, its potential<br>dangers. The leisure modern technology makes available to ever larger<br>numbers of citizens could not be better spent than in @ determined effort<br>to narrow the knowledge g&amp;P between those who understand science and<br>technology and those who do not.</p>
<p>Since law and public opinion always lag behind the swift development</p>
<p>of new technologies, there 4s need for more 4nformed and responsible</p>

<p>As I see it, the most important aspect of the engineer&#x27;s code of</p>
<p>umnecessarily aggravate future conditions of life. To my mind his greatest<br>task is to do everything he can to preserve opportunities for a good life<br>to coming generations who will not be as rich in land and resources as we<br>are today. This means, in particular: no needless waste of irreplaceable</p>
<p>materials; no permanent destruction of good soil or of our shrinking water</p>
<p>resources merely for the sake of immediate advantages; it means utmost<br>4ngenuity -n substituting abundant materials for scarce materials, renewable<br>resources for irreplaceable resources.<br>Apove all, it means doing everything possible to preserve and protect<br>our environment for our posterity. |<br>. These are my suggestions; others may have petter ones to offer. What<br>seems to me of utmost importance is that we never for a moment forget that<br>a free society centers on man. It gives paramount consideration to human<br>rights, 4nterests, and needs. Society ceases to be free if a pattern of<br>life develops where technology, not man, -becomes central to its purpose.</p>
<p>We must not permit this to happen lest the human liberties for which mankind</p>
<p>has fought, at so great 4 cost of effort and sacrifice, will be extinguished</p>
