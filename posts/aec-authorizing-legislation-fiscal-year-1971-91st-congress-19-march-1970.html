      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this segment of the 1971 AEC Authorizing Legislation Hearings, Admiral H.G. Rickover passionately advocates for the Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR), presenting it as the singular path to dramatically improve nuclear fuel utilization by converting thorium into fissionable uranium-233, thereby extending energy resources for &quot;hundreds of years&quot; compared to the mere 1-2% efficiency of current light water reactors. He stresses the LWBR&#x27;s practical advantage, noting its adaptability to existing pressurized water reactor (PWR) plants, which limits the &quot;technical uncertainties and extensive development inherent in other reactor concepts&quot; and aligns with the utility industry&#x27;s significant existing investment (estimated at $50 billion). While detailing fabrication progress, including $17 million committed to date for the Shippingport core (targeting 1974 operation with results by 1977), Rickover expresses skepticism about long-range cost projections, famously contrasting &quot;academic&quot; reactor designs with &quot;practical&quot; ones, highlighting the hidden complexities and true expenses of real-world development. He supports his arguments with detailed graphs on uranium mining requirements, cash flow expenditures, and cost comparisons (referencing WASH-1082 and Hanford data), and includes a letter from John W. Simpson of Westinghouse supporting the LWBR program&#x27;s vigorous pursuit.</p>

<p>- statement of vice adm. H. G. Rickover, director, division</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The light water breeder reactor (LWBR) is expected to provide the capability to make a major improvement in the utilization of our nuclear fuel resources without. the many technical uncertainties and extensive development inherent in other reactor concepts, The LWBR is the only known approach to breeding in a light water thermal re- actor. If our development. program is successful, the LWBR core we are fabricating to install in the Shippingport reactor plant in 1974 will demonstrate technology which could permit the conversion of existing and future pressurized water reactors to self-sustaining breeders.</p>
<p>Once an LWBR type core is operating on the breeder cycle, making more uranium-233 from thorium during power operation than it con. sumes, it will be possible to convert about 50 percent of mined thorium into fissionable fuel for use in power production. The United States and world thorium reserves ‘ire So vast that this energy resource could provide mankind with an energy source for hundreds of years into the future.</p>
<p>By comparison, present types of light. water reactors, both boiling and pressurized types, can make available for power production only 1 percent to 2 percent of the potential energy in the nuclear-fuel ré- serves. This tremendous improvement in resource utilization can only be achieved through breeding.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the start of fabrication of the LWBR breeding- demonstration core in fiscal year 1969 and provided additional funds in. fiscal year 1970, The third increment of fabrication funds is $10 million of the $24 million requested for the LWBR in the Commis- sion’s fiscal year 1971 budeet request.</p>
<p>The additional core fa orication money is required to pay 1971 costs</p>
<p>or fuel and related core components, the reactor vessel head, and con-</p>
<p>col rod-drive mechanisms, most of which were obligated under core”</p>
<p>be ne OE years</p>
<p>tracts we entered into with the obligational authority provided by Con- gress in fiscal years 1969 and 1970. The other $14 million included in the fiscal year 1971 budget request is required for the continuing LWBR research and development program.</p>
<p>Manufacturing of the breeding demonstration core is progressing satisfactorily. This work is still on a schedule that should permit us to begin the breeding demonstration in 1974. I expect significant results from the breeding demonstration to be available beginning in 1977.</p>
<p>The LWBR is the only reactor system that promises significant ac ae pine in ‘fuel utilization while being devoid of many of the technical problems that must be solved to obtain high fuel utilization using other systems. In the long term, the LWBR may turn out to be the most practical approach to obtaining the high fuel utilization needed to make nuclear power fulfill its promise of providing man- kind an essentially unlimited energy source.</p>
<p>For many years the utility industry will be committed to basing the expanding nuclear central-station electrical-generating capacity on water-type reactors. Any manufacturer using a different coolant. will find it increasingly difficult to gain acceptance for his product since there will be a great reluctance to change to a new coolant when the water-cooled reactors will have such a wide base.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if events prove one of the alternate concepts is more desirable, the LWBR program will still have provided important contributions to general reactor technology—just as development done by Naval Reactors for the Shippingport project provided basic tech- nology on which the current application of nuclear power in industry is based. Since the expanding nuclear industry will for many years be based on water reactors, the technology developed in the LWBR pro- gram has an assured application.</p>
<p>This concludes my prepared statement on the LWBR, program. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irtexp. Thank you, Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>Mr. Hosmer?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral, on the first page where you state that the present light water reactors can make available for power roduction only 1 to 2 percent of the potential energy in the nuclear- uel reserves, is that in the context of ‘a single loading of a fuel ele- ment absent the reprocessing and refabrication ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. For present types of light water reactors to attain the 1 to 2 percent fuel utilization requires full recycle of unburned uranium-235 in the cores as well as the plutonium formed from irradiation of uranium-238 during the cycle.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But the burnup during the time you are in the reactor is one thing. If you go back in the reactor, you can continue, theoretically, to a hundred-percent burnup, not 1 or 2 percent.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. You must remember that less than 1 per- cent of the mined uranium is fissile—only 0.7 percent is the fissionable uranium-235. The rest is mainly uranium-238 which fissions to a very ‘mall degree from fast neutrons, but for the most part cannot be fis-</p>
<p>ioned unless it is first converted to plutonium. Now, consider what aappens to the 0.7 percent of the uranium which is uranium-235;</p>
<p>roughly 0.2 percent is left in the diffusion plant “tails” and only about 0.5 percent ever gets in a reactor core. If none of the uranium-238 were converted to plutonium and burned, the fuel utilization could be no higher than about 0.5 percent. But by recycling the plutonium many times it may be possible to get the fuel utilization of present types ot light water reactors up to between 1 and 2 percent. or</p>
<p>You can’t make much of an improvement in resource utilization until you start breeding. When you get your ratio of conversion of fertile material to fuel up equal to or exceeding the rate of burning fissile material, the efficiency of fuel use jumps up dramatically. In the case of the LWBR-type reactor we expect it will be possible ulti- mately to convert about half of the available thorium into fissionable uranium-233 for use in power production. The other half of the thorium would be lost during the repeated reprocessing and core fabri- cation cycles.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You state your opinion that any manu- facturer using a different coolant than water is going to find it in- creasingly difficult to gain acceptance for his product. On what do you base that?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The reason for that is very simple, sir. I believe most utility plants are based on having a life of about 30 years. The plant is a major capital investment. Now with the LWBR you can put it in an existing PWR plant and need to change very little.</p>
<p>You must remember, Mr. Hosmer, that the electric utilities have al- ready committed themselves to about $50 billion in long-term invest- ment and operating costs for light water reactors. This includes. buy- ing the plants and fuel for 30 years of operation as well as financing charges. Over half this amount is for pressurized water reactors.</p>
<p>By the time any reactor using a coolant other than light water has been demonstrated sufficiently for widespread use, the industrial base for light water reactors will be much larger than it is already. By that time the component and fuel vendors will have large numbers of trained engineers and skilled workers experienced in designing and manufacturing light water plants. Also, the utilities will have large numbers of their own design, operating and maintenance people trained and experienced in light water reactor technology. As with any new major system introduced in competition with a widely used existing system, the proponents of the introduction of reactors using a coolant other than light water will have to convince the utilities that the bene- fits of the new reactor system warrant the effort, expense and risk of de- veloping a new industrial base to support the new concept. As the in- dustrial commitment to light water reactors increases, the attractive- ness of new reactor concepts must also increase if they are to gain acceptance.</p>
<p>In the Shippingport reactor we will replace the pressure vessel closure and control-drive mechanisms. We plan to use the rest of the plant. On the other hand, if a utility wants to go to a liquid metal breeder he has to put up a brand new plant. He cannot use any part of a water plant except perhaps some of the instrumentation.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Theoretically, however, once having bui</p>
<p>a plant as a light water plant and under the compulsion to constantly expand his utility system, anyway, it is unlikely you are going to retrofit reactors into breeders.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It depends on what value you put on energy sources. If you have a constantly expanding industry and do not care about conservation of fuel, you are correct, sir. You would then just put up new plants regardless of their fuel utilization. However, if the conservation of energy resources is of moment and if there is public objection to having large numbers of plants, then you must do every- thing you can to keep your number of plants at a minimum, and have each plant be as efficient in fuel use as possible to save your energy sources.</p>
<p>Of course, that is the entire purpose of breeding. In my view, the sole purpose of breeding is to get more energy out of your uranium and thorium reserves and thus insure a long term source of electrical energy for future generations. .</p>
<p>Representative Hoan: One more coolant question. With the em- phasis that the AEC Division of Reactor Development and Tech- nology is putting on the liquid-metal fast-breeder, isn’t it coming into sufficient familiarity on the part of the utilities so that the liquid- metal systems are going to be acceptable?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. As far as I know, there are a considerable num- ber of utilities, including Consolidated Edison, who are involved with the liquid-metal breeder. I am sure their engineers are quite familiar with what is going on. I believe a number of them are playing an active part in it. Mr. Roddis is, himself, I know.</p>
<p>However, I doubt that any utility is going to build a large liquid- metal reactor until a reasonably sized one has been proved out by the Government. I doubt that you will get a utility to put up all its own money, unless there are some tax write-offs or something of this sort, until it has been proven. I don’t think you will get the utility industry to pay the huge sums of money.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. The demonstration program is aimed at that very point, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. After it has been demonstrated, with a reason- ably sized reactor, and if the utilities play a part in the construction and operation of the plant, I am sure at that point they will go ahead— provided, of course, it works and they think it is all right for wide- spread application.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral, I am going to ask you a series of about six questions which are aimed at comparing some things that have to do with the LWBR and the PWR.</p>
<p>Capital costs of large lwbr’s and pwr’s</p>
<p>The first is, will you give us a feel for the comparative capital costs of the light-water breeder and the ordinary pressurized water reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There is no inherent reason why they should differ greatly, that is, the LWBR from a PWR, of similar rating.</p>
<p>For example, we plan to install the LWBR breeding-demonstration core into the existing Shippingport reactor plant without modifica- ‘ions other than those associated with physically changing the core.</p>
<p>“hat is, we will provide a new core, a new vessel head and a new con-</p>
<p>trol-drive mechanisms. The breeding-demonstration core is expected to operate at about the power level for which the Shippingport reactor plant was initially designed and operated during the life of the first core.</p>
<p>Of course, the breeder core has certain design features that are necessary to achieve breeding, such as a closely spaced fuel lattice and moving fuel-reactivity control. These features can and probably will affect costs. However, there is no reason to expect that the overall capital cost for a nuclear central station with a light water breeder core would vary much from a pressurized water reactor of the same rating.</p>
<p>There certainly will be more expenses at the beginning—there al- ways are on a new type. Once you get over making the first core and you start adding more of the same type, of course, you have already paid for the learning, and more companies will get into the business. Costs then start going down.</p>
<p>pe ppeeeitiait ve Hosmer. My question was predicated not on first of a kind.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think there will probably be some more capital cost, but not a significant amount. Of course, it is a more complex core.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Can you give us the same kind of compari- son for operating and maintenance costs?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. The maintenance cost should be no different. Once you install a core in the pressure vessel, it is locked in. It works or does not work. There is nothing you can do about it. The core is there. You don’t need more people.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. A little more cost of fabricating the core?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes. Initially there certainly will be some more cost for fabricating the core. You cannot make a comparison on the first core. You will remember that when we were building the Ship- pingport reactor the utility industry took great issue—the utility in- dustry said it was no good, the costs were too high, which is always true of the first development model of anything.</p>
<p>Fuel costs of large lwbr’s and pwr’s</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Let us pull it down a little bit closer, right to the fuel cycle, itself, for comparison and see how costs compare for the two different types of reactors, such things as inventory charges, fuel fabrication costs, burnup costs, and so on.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Mr. Hosmer, as I have stated on many occasions in the past, I don’t believe comparisons of long-range cost projections of systems under development are meaningful. Even cost projections of systems already developed are of doubtful validity.</p>
<p>For example, you have seen direct evidence yourself of the wide variation in the costs phi for commercial nuclear central stations of existing types even during the past few years. Cost projections are based on assumptions about reactor performance, allowable heat flux, allowable fuel central temperature, reactor operating requirements, as well as economic assumptions.</p>
<p>The use of different assumptions often affects the calculated cost to a much greater extent than the differences one would calculate be- tween different systems. Using one set of assumptions, one system might look cheaper while, on a different set of assumptions, a different system might come out cheaper.</p>
<p>Further, the system predicted to have the lowest cost may not be technically achievable, no matter how much is spent on development.</p>
<p>I would like later on to read from an editorial I wrote about 15 years ago about the “academic” and the “practical” reactor.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe many of the assumptions made in comparative studies of the economics of future reactors can lead to false or im- proper conclusions.</p>
<p>One such assumption is ignoring the inflationary trend this coun- try has been experiencing during the past decade. If a reasonable rate of inflation is counted, this increases future costs and increases their impact on any cost studies using the so-called “present worth” method of discounting.</p>
<p>Another assumption usually made is that interest must be charged against the value of all owned assets.</p>
<p>In essence, these two assumptions say that you cannot afford to buy something of value now when prices are low and hold it for future use when prices will be higher.</p>
<p>Another assumption normally made is the size of the industry producing the product. The larger the industry, the cheaper the unit price of the product, so it is said. If you assume a large enough fuel- fabrication and processing industry, the fabrication and processing costs, of course, then become a very small part of fuel-cycle costs.</p>
<p>We did one study last year in which we estimated the fuel cost as- sociated with the fuel inventory and burnup parts of the fuel cycle for a 1,000-megawatt electrical, pressurized-water reactor of the type projected by industry as compared to a rough estimate we made of a 1,000-megawatt light-water breeder. We took into account the fact that after about 10 years of operation, the breeder would be on a self- sustaining cycle, where thorium is the only makeup fuel required, while it is necessary to continue mining uranium for the PWR through- out its life.</p>
<p>Also, once a given capacity of LWBR plants is operating on a breed- ing cycle, that capacity is available essentially forever without re- quiring the mining of more uranium.</p>
<p>We also used the increase in uranium cost calculated by Mr. Shaw’s people due to the rate of consumption of uranium forecast for present types of light-water reactors. And we used an inflation effect of 3 per- cent per year. You are well aware that the inflation effects during the past several years has been much higher than 3 percent.</p>
<p>Uhave here some graphs which show the results of these calculations.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. By way of interjection, I thought you were going to attack my question, but you are answering it too.</p>
<p>. Admiral Ricxover. Sir, your questions are always cogent, relevant, and to the point. I am most happy to answer them.</p>
<p>Is that the proper way to say it, Mr. Chairman?</p>
<p>“1698</p>
<p>Chairman Hotariexp. It sounds like you’ covered the waterfront.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The first graph shows the uranium-mining re- quirement’ for inventory and burnup for a single 1,000-megawatt light-water breedei, compared. with''a ‘Single 1,900-megawatt-PWR. You can gee that aftér about 10 years ho more uranium need be mined forthe LWBR. After 30 years only: about one-third as much dranium has had to be mined to support the LWBR asthe PWR’</p>
<p>Of course, no uranium has to be mined for the LWBR replacement plant,-since on‘a self-sustaining’ breéding cycle you “will always: have one -reactor’s worth’ of U2&quot; available for use in réplacement. plants.</p>
<p>Now look at the next’ graph. This shows 4° calculation Of cash ‘flow for the uranium’ ‘and thorium inventory and’burnup over ‘the 30-year life of the plant. You can see initially there is a gréater cash outfiow for the LWBR, because the LWEBR prebreeder cores'contain more fuel because of the‘closely spaced “fuel lattice needed to breed. However, after 10 years there is no’ more cash outflow for uranium for the LWBR while the cash outflow continues for uranium for the entire 30-year life for the PWR. The total cash outflow for the PWR exceeds that for the LWBR after about 10 years. ; : tos</p>
<p>‘This graphically illustrates one of my points about economic as- sumptions. Accounting for the interest on this early cash outflow for a breeder.but ignoring the increased cost. of ‘inflation on the later cash flow of a nonbreeder that can mislead people into undervaluing a breeder. OO</p>
<p>Now turn to the third graph. This shows the results of a. present- worth calculation of the.cash flow of the second. graph as a notion of interest rate, assuming3-percent annual inflation. This shows that a nonbreeding PWR can be.much more expensive in fuel cost, since it is very sensitive to the interest rate. The LWBR is not sensitive to</p>
<p>the interest rate, since. it does not require makeup uranium, after 10</p>
<p>The. difference between the two curves on: the third graph. is the cash value available to offset possibly higher fabrication and process- ing costs for-a. breeding core compared to.a conventional PWR..</p>
<p>‘These costs comparisons of course prove nothing concerning the rela- tive overall potential economics of large-scale PWR’s and, LWBR’s. However, it should be obvious there:is no present basis for concludin, which will be more expensive or whether future LWBR’s will or will not bea, reasonable choice for a-utility. to make compared to present types of water reactors when all factors are considered. After all, our veal natural resources are our people, our air, our water, and. our minerals in the ground, not, dollars. We may. conclude it is in the na- tional interest,'to. pay money, if necessary, to conserve. our energy resources once thé technology’ gives. us the. capability. .-. .</p>

<p>Admiral Ricrover. Now I would like to read some comments I made at an earlier time about theoretical-versus-practical reactors. It was in the early 1950’s—— a</p>
<p>Representative Hosmzr. You understand I am asking for compari- son simply between PWR and LWBR, don’t you?- -</p>
<p>Admiral Ricrover. Yes, sir. -.</p>
<p>With your permission, T would like to bring in what some of these highfalutin ideas—I am not referring to you, of course—you being a member of this committee, everything you say has the validity of law— but I am talking about other misinformed people. [Laughter.]</p>
<p>Senator Arken. Did you say “other”—“other misinformed people”?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovezr. I certainly did not mean to imply in any way that Mr. Hosmer is misinformed. He is one of the best informed people</p>
<p>know. ar .</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to erase the word “other” from my</p>
<p>Testimony. , ; practical versus academic reactors ;</p>
<p>Many years ago one was never allowed to'say anything about these theoretical reactors. So I hit on a device of publishing an editorial in the “Journal of Reactor Science and Technology,” volume. III, No. 3, which was a very secret document. And it sneaked by because no one knew I was publishing this editorial. Furthermore, it was'in a secret document.</p>
<p>I let this be known to people. So after it was published, they went to the Commission and said, “Look, there is no restricted data in this editorial.” So finally it was published. '</p>
<p>I would like to read this editorial because what I said many years ago, in my opinion, is still applicable today.</p>
<p>Important decisions relative to the future development of atomic power must frequently be made by people who do not necessarily have an intimate knowl- edge of the technical aspects of reactors. These people are, nonetheless, interested in what a reactor plant will do, how much it will cost, how long it will take to build, and how long and how well it will operate. :</p>
<p>You see, these are the same questions you are asking me, Mr. Hosmer, right now, the same thing. '</p>
<p>When they attempt to learn these things, they become aware of confusion exist- ing in the reactor business. There appears to be unresolved conflict on almost every issue that arises.</p>
<p>I believe that this confusion stems from a failure to distinguish between the academic and the practical. These apparent conflicts can usually be explained only when the various aspects of the issue are resolved into their academic anq practical components, To aid in this resolution, it is possible to define in a gen eral way those characteristics which distinguish the one from the other.</p>
<p>An academic reactor or reactor plant almost always has the following basic characteristics :</p>
<p>' (1) It is simple. (2) It is small. . (3) Itis cheap. : (4) Itislight. .</p>
<p>(5) It can be built very'quickly..-  - -  - .°. :</p>
<p>(6) It is very flexible in purpose. (‘omnibus reactor”). -</p>
<p>(7) Very little development is required. It will use mostly “off-the-shelf” components, —~ — Tt oste ss nn</p>
<p>(8) The reactor is in the study phase. It is not being built now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a practical reactor plant can be distinguished by the following characteristics.</p>
<p>(1) It is being built now.</p>
<p>(2) It is behind schedule.</p>
<p>(3) It is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items. Corrosion, in particular, is a problem.</p>
<p>(4) It is very expensive.</p>
<p>(5) It takes a long time to build because of the engineering-development problems. :</p>
<p>(6) Itis large.</p>
<p>(7) It is heavy.</p>
<p>(8) It is complicated.</p>
<p>A common example can be given to indicate the application of the above generalities.</p>
<p>A fairly conventional academic power reactor might use natural or slightly enriched uranium rods in which the burnup is a minimum of 10,000 megawatt- days per ton. The fission products are confined to the fuel element by a simple cladding technique. The elements operate in high-pressure water at 600 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>In the practical reactor, difficulties are encountered. No element of the above type has been tested beyond a few thousand megawatt-days per ton. Hight years of work on high-uranium fuels have failed to produce cladding techniques which give really satisfactory performance in water at even 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>That was at that time.</p>
<p>At 600 degrees Fahrenheit, uranium reacts violently when exposed to water. The Chalk River experience shows the difficulty of maintaining a plant in which some fission products have escaped.</p>
<p>The tools of the academic-reactor designer are a piece of paper and a pencil with an eraser. If a mistake is made, it can always be erased and changed. If the practical reactor designer errs, he wears the mistake around his neck; it cannot be erased. Everyone can see it.</p>
<p>The academic reactor designer is a dilettante. He has not yet had to assume any real responsibility in connection with his projects. He is free to luxuriate in elegant ideas, the practical shortcomings of which can be relegated to the cate- gory of “mere technical details.” The practical reactor designer must live with these same technical details. Although recalcitrant and awkward, they must Be solved and cannot be put off until tomorrow. Their solutions require man- power, time, and money.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for those who must make far-reaching decisions without the benefit of an intimate knowledge of reactor technology, and unfortunately for the interested public, it is much easier to get the academic side of an issue than the practical side.</p>
<p>_ For example, the siting of reactor plants—I am sure this is the same issue you face in this committee on other areas.</p>
<p>For a large part those involved with the academic reactors have more in- clination and time to present their ideas in reports and orally to those who will listen. Since they are innocently unaware of the real but hidden difficulties of their plans, they speak with great facility and confidence. Those involved with practical reactors, humbled by their experience, speak less and worry more.</p>
<p>Yet it is incumbent on those in high places to make wise decisions, and it is reasonable and important that the public be correctly informed. It is con- sequently incumbent on all of us to state the facts as forthrightly as possible. Although it is probably impossible to have reactor ideas labeled as “practical” or “academic” by the authors, it is worthwhile for both the authors and the audience to bear in mind this distinction and to be guided thereby.</p>
<p>I wrote that on June 5, 1953.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I guess if today you were rewriting it, all you would add is that the practical reactor is under attack by the ~nvironmentalists.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right. This is one of the great dilemmas or any congressional committee. You have all sorts of people who</p>
<p>are experts, who’ comme to you.’ They are wise men: They have many degrees, You listen to all these people, you say, “I am only a politician. How can I understand this thing?” That is the problem you have. _</p>

It is an easy and fatal-step to think that the accuracy of our arithmetic is equivalent to the accuracy of our knowledge about the problem in hand.

<p>Re - ° . Lwbr:i8 ‘a ‘development project</p>
<p>“I would like to add one thing here —where I stand-on the LWBB- ‘The LWBR._is a development project. We are trying out technolog ta show whether this technology works... 20-6 est es</p>
<p>It has been my experience—and I am sure this committee knows this—that every time you develop something new and different, it becomes more economical after the development problems have been solved and people start thinking positively about what can be done to apply the technology.</p>
<p>I have often referred to this problem as a “failure of imagination.” It is not unique to civilian reactor development. I ran into the same problem 20 years ago in nuclear-submarine development.</p>
<p>There were many in the Navy and Department of Defense who could not see the value of a nuclear submarine that can operate sub- merged indefinitely.</p>
<p>There are your people who have the greatest facility with paper, pencil, and erasers.</p>
<p>Lwbr fuel cycle cost</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral, I have one other question. Is there a cost of U;O; at which the fuel-cycle cost of an LWBR would be lower than those of a regular PWR?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. May I ask Mr. Leighton to answer that question ?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Right.</p>
<p>Mr. Letcuton. If you will turn to figure 3 that you have in front of you there, Mr. Hosmer, you will see that as a function of inter- est rate we have plotted the total cost of uranium and thorium to run either a PWR or an LWBR over the life of the plant as far as the material is concerned.</p>
<p>You can see from this graph a 1,000-megawatt electrical LWBR would be cheaper in fuel cost for material than would be a PWR over the life of the plant.</p>
<p>Now, this plot does not take into consideration the residual value at the end. The residual value at the end would be much higher for the LWBR than for the PWR.</p>
<p>The answer to part of your question is, yes, the material may be cheaper. The problem is that we are not able to predict the total fuel- cycle cost.</p>
<p>One of the big unknowns is in the fabrication cost. As the admiral pointed out, until you develop the LWBR and find out what is in- volved and then get fuel fabricators to see how to make it cheaper, you don’t know what your fuel-cycle cost will be.</p>
<p>We are not in a position to say today whether you can or cannot develop an LWBR-type core that can make the fuel-cycle cost cheaper than for a PWR. We just do not know.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I think that you realize that the questions T have asked you today are not particularly mine but are those which are kicking around the trade. I thought as a service to both of us, it would be well to get them on the record and have them answered.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Hosmer, public money is being spent on this project, as on any other project. There is no secrecy in the LWBR project. Therefore, any question is a legitimate question and should = asked. We should, as you say, clear up any points that people may</p>
<p>However, I do want to make it clear we cannot in many of these wes give exact answers until the development is done and people sart thinking positively about applying the technology.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmzr. That is exactly true.</p>
<p>&quot; lwbr fuel inventory -</p>
<p>Mr. Ramer. Mr. Chairman, I think on this question of the initial fuel inventory for the light. water breeder, our studies in the last year or two have made that look considerably better in terms of reactor design and fuel management.. . 7</p>
<p>The reason I mention this is that in the analysis of the light water breeder concept, one of the alleged problems of the light water breeder- is this initial inventory, and applying utility-accounting practices to it always seemed to make costs seem a little high at the start. —</p>
<p>When we started talking to the equipment companies in the last few months that would be selling this type of reactor in the 1980’s, hope- fully, I think they feel a good deal better about it now and believe that it is a manageable thing from a financial standpoint.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. You must bear in mind one thing, sir, that we are building this breeding demonstration now. We are beyond any de- sign stage. We know our expected performance figures. Our physics have had to be carefully figured out, because whenever you get close to. this 1.0 or a little over in end-of-life fissile inventory ratio, you have to be very careful. .</p>
<p>As you well know, a very small fraction of a percent above or below 1.0 end-of-life fissile inventory ratio makes a great deal of difference. We have been verifying this now for a year or year and a half. We are certain, insofar as it is humanly possible to be certain, we know where we stand, because we are building the core now.</p>
<p>Mr. Leteuton. May I make one comment, Mr. Chairman?</p>
<p>Chairman Hottriexp. Yes. .</p>
<p>Mr. Lerenton. In regard to fissile fuel inventory the graph we were just discussing includes the original fuel inventory as well as the fuel usage over the life of the plant. So the cost of inventory is included in this curve for both the PWR and for the LWBR and the graph shows the effect.</p>
<p>One other thing, Mr. Hosmer. Your questions certainly are not origi- nal, as you have pointed out. These graphs we have used to answer your questions were prepared over a year ago to answer almost identi- cal q&lt;uestions on the part of the Commission and the Bureau-of the Budget. This same information was presented to the Commission and to the Bureau of the Budget in their review last year and’ was con- sidered by them in their recommendations to continue with the LWBR</p>
<p>roject. - ; oar at P Representative Hosmer. Possibly, now that they have been presented in a committee hearing, the word will.get around more.thoroughly-</p>
<p>Mr. Le1cuton. Maybe so, sir. oe - re</p>
<p>The point I want to make clear is that this information has-all. been reviewed by the Commission and the Bureau of the Budget. Appar- ently, they have been satisfied with the answers to these and many other questions, because they have been willing to support the project.</p>
<p>Chairman Hotirmrp. The-Chair would like to recognize Senator Aiken, if he desires recognition, , . Me -</p>
<p>Senator Arken. I don’t think I have any questions to ask at this time..</p>
<p>Admiral, I know you are doing good work as fast as you can and as well as you can, so I don’t think I will delay-this hearing any longer a this time. . rr</p>
<p>Admiral Ricrover. Senator Aiken, we have many problems on this project, as on any other project, because by definition a development project will have problems. If it does not have problems, if you already know the answers, then there is nothing to it. We have many problems. But I think we try to face them squarely, and we have always kept the Commission and this committee informed of our problems.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.triexp. Mr. Price?</p>
<p>Representative Price. No questions.</p>
<p>Chairman Hottrimxp. Mr. Anderson ?</p>
<p>Representative Anprrson. Admiral, you say that the experiment will begin in 1974 and in 38 years you will have significant results. What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The breeding demonstration core is expected to start operation in 1974. The life of that core is about 3 years. After the 3 years of power operation the core will be removed and analyzed to determine whether we have achieved our objective of having bred as much uranium-233 as we have burned in the 3 years of power opera- tion. Of course, we will get some information as we go along. You can almost immediately check if the physics are correct, because you can run at different power levels. Also, this core is very highly instru- mented. So we will be able to find out what goes on in the core. That is one of the reasons these developmental cores are expensive, because we do much to it that is not necessary for the core, itself.</p>
<p>But ultimately the only way we can find out how well we will do on breeding is by using the core up and chemically processing it. That is the only way there is in the world to find out. You have to wait until you have run the life of the core.</p>
<p>Chairman Hottrrexp. Mrs. May ?</p>
<p>Representative May. I have no questions.</p>
<p>Chairman Hotirtevp. I have one or two questions, and then we will go to our next witness.</p>
<p>What is the present status of the fabrication of the LWBR breeding demonstration ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. The new equipment that is required consists principally of the core, pressure-vessel head, and control-drive mech- anisms, as I said. Everything else already in the plant is being reused. Work on the new equipment began in fiscal year 1969, and the present status is as follows.</p>
<p>To date a total of a little over $17 million has been spent or com- mitted for fabrication of the breeding-demonstration core.</p>
<p>The order for the pressure-vessel head was placed in March 1969. The heavy forging has been completed, and fabrication is proceeding. Delivery is scheduled for mid-1972.</p>
<p>A development control drive mechanism has been fabricated and is on test. The design of the production mechanisms is complete. In arallel, lead units of this production design are being manufactured.</p>
<p>The core barrel was ordered in December 1968. Material has been</p>
<p>elivered and fabrication is proceeding. Delivery is scheduled for the</p>
<p>summer of 1971. Other structural parts of the core are also in manufacture.</p>
<p>The thorium-fuel pellets were ordered in February 1969. Work under this order continues.</p>
<p>The fabrication of the zircaloy tubing has started. The order for manufacture to the final sizes will be placed this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The remaining core fabrication work, including thorium dioxide— uranium-233 oxide binary pellets, zircaloy structures, fuel-rod sup- port, and fuel-rod assembly, and core assembly, is being done at Bettis. Manufacturing preparations at Bettis for this work started in early 1969. Some portions are already complete, and manufacturing devel- opment and preproduction are underway in all areas.</p>
<p>Work is on a schedule that permits starting the breeding demonstra- tion in 1974.</p>
<p>So, to sum it up, sir; this is all under manufacture. On all parts of the project the manufacturing is underway to fit the time schedule of 1974.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirrerp. Thank you for that full statement on that</p>
<p>oint. At my request, Mr. John Simpson, president of Westinghouse Power Systems, furnished the Joint Committee with a copy of his letter to Chairman Seaborg of October 16, setting forth his reasons for stating—and I quote part of his letter:</p>
<p>“T feel that the LWBR breeding-demonstration program should be pursued vigorously by the Commission.”</p>
<p>We will insert his letter to Dr. Seaborg at this point in the record, as it bears on this point.</p>
<p>(The letter referred to follows:)</p>
<p>WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORPORATION, Pittsburgh, Pa., October 16, 1969. Dr. GLENN T. SEABORG, Chairman, U.8. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Seasore: I appreciate the opportunity I had to review the progress and status of the Light Water Breeder Reactor ( LWBR) program at the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory on the occasion of the recent visit by the General Advisory Committee. The high quality of the work in progress was evident to me during our tours. The work accomplished to date strongly supports breeding in a light water-cooled, thorium-fueled reactor. The technology being developed is also of benefit to other reactor programs, particularly in the areas of reactor fuels and reactor materials.</p>
<p>Although Westinghouse is committed to the long range goal of developing an economical liquid metal fast breeder reactor ( LMFBR), it is my belief that the LWBR may well occupy an important place in commercial power in the event that the fast breeder program is delayed. Since the LWBR is less develonmental than other reactor concepts and can be backfitted into present day PWRs, the possibility of its early introduction by utilities, if conditions warrant, is evident. Thus, LWBR provides an excellent opportunity for the continued use of our light water reactor power generating facilities and operating experience.</p>
<p>We predict that the plutonium availability from light water reactors will exceed the demand for use in fast breeder reactors, emphasizing the need for more effort on plutonium recycle. At the GAC review, Bettis stated that pre- liminary studies indicate plutonium could be effectively used as a fissile fuel in pre-breeder operation to produce U233 for breeding. Thus, it appears that LWBR could serve a complementary role with the PWRs for the use of this material. '</p>
<p>Based on the ‘above, I feel that the LWBR breeder demonstration progre should be pursued vigorously by the Commission.</p>
<p>Sincerely, JOHN W. Simpson.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrienp. As the witness has noted, the Commission is behind this. The Bureau of the Budget is supporting it. And, of course, the committee has been supporting this for some time now. We are glad to hear the report. of progress on it, Admiral.</p>
<p>Admiral Riexover. Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Honieiy, Thank you very much. We will excuse you now at this time and call the next witness to the stand.</p>
<p>You will stand by, Admiral Rickover, for a later meeting with the committee, won’t you?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Honirrevp. Mr. Roddis, welcome from the firing line.</p>
<p>Mr. Roddis is president of the Consolidated Edison Co. of New York. He is a pirate of the Joint Committee staff , 1 might add, having taken John Conway away from us when we weren't looking. We will forgive you, however, because we know you have a lot of problems up there, and we believe John ean help you solve them.</p>
<p>You may proceed with your statement, Mr. Roddis.</p>
