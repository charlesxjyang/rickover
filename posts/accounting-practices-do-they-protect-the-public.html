      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a scathing 1970 address to the Federal Government Accountants Association, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover passionately argued that federal accountants have largely failed in their duty to protect the public interest, particularly regarding defense contracts. He highlighted the urgent need for uniform cost accounting standards, estimating potential savings of $2 billion annually, and criticized the ineffectiveness of the Truth-in-Negotiations Act (1962) and contract renegotiation due to widespread non-compliance and inadequate accounting rules. Rickover detailed how current practices, including profit calculations based on a percentage of cost and the unchecked growth of conglomerates, lead to inflated costs and discourage efficiency. Citing figures like the $40 billion spent on military procurement in 1969, and referencing thinkers from Lord Kelvin and Oscar Wilde to Peter Drucker, he challenged the profession to move beyond self-interest and corporate loyalty, urging them to embrace a broader public responsibility akin to the Hippocratic oath.</p>

        <p>ACCOUNTING PRACTICES - DO THEY PROTECT THE PUBLIC?</p>
<p>by Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy</p>
<p>at the Federal Government Accountants Association 19th Annual National Symposium, Carillon Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida, Thursday, June 18, 1970</p>
<p>I welcome the opportunity to address your Association.</p>
<p>I have some definite views related to the theme of your Symposium "Prologue to Progress: Let the public service be a proud and lively career," especially as it applies to the federal accountant.</p>
<p>It is my view that the accountant, particularly the federal accountant, must accept a greater responsibility for the public well-being.</p>
<p>I am a Naval Officer and an engineer, not an accountant. My interest in accounting stems from my experience in managing technical programs for the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense, and from personal concern as an interested citizen. It also stems from the fact that the funds I am given are limited and must be expended as economically as possible or we will have fewer ships to protect our country. Added to this is my knowledge, based on much experience, that without the active help of accountants, I cannot do my job efficiently.</p>
<p>For over 20 years I have been responsible for designing, procuring, constructing and maintaining the nuclear plants in our nuclear-powered warships. I was also responsible for the design and construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first full-scale central station nuclear power plant in the United States. Managing civilian and military programs has afforded me a unique opportunity to assess the contributions as well as the deficiencies of federal accounting, particularly as they relate to government dealings with industry.</p>
<p>Professional societies in all disciplines must, I believe, be more active in looking out for the public interest. A year ago I made this same point in an address to the American Society for Metals. I questioned whether industrial safety codes developed by private industry associations were adequate to prevent injury to the public health and well-being. I asked, "Who protects the public?" The same question applies here. Who protects the public in accounting matters?</p>
<p>Today our nation faces many difficult problems. Our cities are crowded and run-down. We are using up our natural resources at a prodigious rate. We have polluted our water supply and the air we breathe. The ecological balance is threatened.</p>
<p>The ever-increasing concentration of economic power in giant corporations threatens our competitive economic structure. In a number of basic items, our industrial society is no longer competitive in world markets. Balance of payments deficits are a recurrent worry. Many of our institutions have grown so large, they are almost unmanageable. For example, the Department of Defense today is larger than the entire federal government was in 1939, and federal employment has tripled since then. Inflation and cost overruns are plaguing military programs. The public has lost confidence in military procurement. The words "economy in Government" have lost significance.</p>
<p>Can the federal government accountants solve all of these problems? Obviously not. But the point I want to make is that you could make a greater contribution than you have in the past.</p>
<p>I am encouraged that your agenda includes panel discussions on three topics relating to current problems in defense procurement: uniform cost accounting standards, implementation of the Truth-in-Negotiations Act, and profits on defense contracts. The problems in each of these areas relate directly to your professional accounting responsibilities as well as your responsibilities to the public.</p>
<p>The role of the federal government has expanded over the years. Today the government affects the economic climate in which almost every industry operates. It regulates banking, communications, broadcasting, transportation, and utilities. It subsidizes farming, shipping, airlines, large and small business. It spends $60 billion a year through government contracts. It collects over $200 billion a year in income taxes, social security taxes, excise taxes, and so forth. It greatly influences education, health and welfare, scientific research and development—every aspect of national life.</p>
<p>The growth of large industrial and financial corporations has paralleled the growth of the federal government. Years ago, the typical business unit was a small, local establishment with a single owner. But for the past one hundred years, the history of industrial development in the United States is largely the story of the growth of large corporations. The advantages of the corporation as an instrumentality for the conduct of business in a free enterprise system have resulted in its phenomenal growth in the United States. The reality is that a new economic order is emerging, characterized by large industrial organizations that maintain a partnership between themselves and government.</p>
<p>It may be that in this rapidly spiraling scientific and technological age this is the best way to marshal our resources, both for national security and for optimum economic use of resources and manpower. If this is so, a great responsibility rests on all of us to see that these giant organizations do not become, in effect, a fourth branch of government—a fourth branch, but without the accountability to the public that is the distinguishing mark of a democracy.</p>
<p>For if the tendency of the federal bureaucracy to make accommodations with industrial corporations is not properly controlled, we will, in effect, have a fourth branch of government, where men exert power without political responsibility. This constitutes a threat to our democratic society and makes it imperative that the federal accountant do his job properly, since it is his responsibility to make relevant facts visible and to show the financial consequences of management actions. It is therefore essential that accounting be accurate in a total sense—that it be meticulous in portraying facts as they are, not as someone wants them to be. Lord Kelvin once said:</p>
<p>"When you measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind."</p>
<p>It is the accountant's job to insure that the relevant facts are expressed in the right numbers.</p>
<p>As our nation has grown, this role of the accountant, both in government and out, becomes more and more important to the public and to those responsible for the management and supervision of our large industrial and governmental institutions.</p>
<p>Government, the public, and industry management look to the accountant for objective reports. They want differences in accounting figures to reflect real differences. They want timely and responsive reports containing reliable information so that they may be able to judge efficiency. This cannot be achieved unless there are definitive rules and standards for reporting costs.</p>
<p>The difference between operating with and without definitive accounting rules is like the difference between a man who has fallen into the water and a man who is bathing—both have to swim, but one does it frantically from necessity and the other deliberately from choice.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of accountants, and particularly of federal accountants, to establish proper standards. In my opinion the federal accountants have not, as a group, met their public responsibility in this regard. Consider first the current situation in defense contracting. The Department of Defense spent over $40 billion for military procurement in 1969. Of this amount, about $4 billion was spent in formally advertised, competitive contracts and the remainder, $36 billion, in negotiated procurements—procurements which are not truly competitive. Of the $36 billion in negotiated procurement, $24 billion was spent under sole-source contracts; $12 billion in contracts involving only limited competition among two or sometimes three bidders.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances supplier costs are bound to be the primary consideration in determining contract prices. The government is, however, compelled to rely almost entirely on the contractor's estimates and cost records for data to determine the reasonableness of the prices he demands.</p>
<p>I find that it is virtually impossible, without spending months reconstructing each supplier's books, to discover what it really costs to manufacture defense equipment or how much profit contractors actually make in producing it. The problem is the extreme variability of accounting practices—the lack of uniform standards. Costs on some contracts are not considered as costs on other contracts. Contractors price contracts under one accounting system, yet charge their costs under a different accounting system. On most defense contracts there is no requirement that the contractor keep meaningful cost records. In these circumstances, it becomes virtually impossible to determine true costs.</p>
<p>I first raised the issue of cost accounting standards for defense contracts before Congress in 1963. Each year thereafter I testified before Congressional committees about the serious need for such standards. Finally, in 1968, the House of Representatives passed a bill requiring the development of uniform cost accounting standards for defense contracts. Even at that late date the accounting profession gave little heed to the problem.</p>
<p>In the 1968 Senate hearings on the House Bill, the Department of Defense claimed that adequate standards already existed. The General Accounting Office hedged and attempted to side-step the issue. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants opposed the bill. Financial executives of company after company in the defense industry went on record against the bill.</p>
<p>In all the accounting profession, only Mr. J. S. Seidman of Seidman and Seidman, Certified Public Accountants, testified to the serious need for cost accounting standards. The federal government accountants were conspicuous by their silence. As a result, the bill that emerged from Congress in 1968 required only that the General Accounting Office study the matter.</p>
<p>After studying it, the GAO agreed that uniform cost accounting standards are both feasible and necessary. Mr. Staats, the Comptroller General, in testimony before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, stated that he believed uniform cost accounting standards would result in a substantial saving of public funds. My own estimate is about $2 billion a year.</p>
<p>Industry, of course, strongly opposes uniform cost accounting standards. It is lobbying to weaken, frustrate, or if possible kill uniform cost accounting legislation. To hear industry tell it, uniform cost accounting standards would be a tragedy.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Oscar Wilde's famous quip about the death of Little Nell in Dickens' Old Curiosity Shop a man would have to have a heart of stone to read their stories without laughing. Industry naturally does not like uniform cost accounting standards. It would like to continue the system whereby it can nationalize its losses and privatize its gains.</p>
<p>To date this lobbying has been effective, aided to a considerable degree by the reluctance of federal accountants, particularly the General Accounting Office, to take the initiative in establishing such standards. Several years ago, the General Accounting Office testified to Congress that someone other than they should conduct the study of uniform accounting standards. Ultimately, Congress had to direct it to make the study.</p>
<p>Now the study is complete and the need for uniform cost accounting standards well established. However, the GAO—legally the most authoritative accounting group in government—has once more testified that some group other than itself should be given the job of setting these standards.</p>
<p>That office took a similar position when the Joint Economic Committee asked it to study defense profits. The Comptroller General said it was not his job; someone else should do it—someone outside government—or industry might not cooperate.</p>
<p>One excuse given by the GAO in backing away from sensitive issues has been that it lacks the legislative authority to do the job. Yet its charter is extremely broad. Here is an extract:</p>
<p>"The Comptroller General shall investigate at the seat of Government or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds, and shall make to the President when requested by him and to Congress at the beginning of each regular session, a report in writing of the work of the General Accounting Office, containing recommendations concerning the legislation he may deem necessary to facilitate the prompt and accurate rendition and settlement of accounts and concerning such other matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and application of public funds as he may think advisable. In such regular report, or in a special report at any time when Congress is in session, he shall make recommendations looking to greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures."</p>
