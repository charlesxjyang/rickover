      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a July 15, 1970 address to the SOS and Chowder and Marching Study Groups, Admiral Rickover, identifying as an &quot;amateur historian,&quot; offers insights into American political parties by drawing parallels between the 1970s and historical realignments, specifically Washington&#x27;s first administration and the 1850s. He posits that a party&#x27;s enduring success hinges on its ability to align with the core beliefs and frustrations of a stable &quot;middle American&quot; majority, rather than relying on coalitions of minorities. Rickover illustrates this through the failures of the Federalists and Whigs, contrasting them with the successes of Jefferson and Madison&#x27;s Republicans and later Lincoln&#x27;s Republican Party, which championed &quot;free labor&quot; and the &quot;Protestant Ethic.&quot; He advises that, like the 1860 Republicans who appealed to self-reliant, hardworking citizens, today&#x27;s party should represent the &quot;middle segment&quot; that values law and order, quality education, individual responsibility, and fair taxation, while advocating for reforms like public campaign financing. Rickover also references Carl Becker and Carl Schurz.</p>

        <p>Remarks before the SOS and the Chowder and Marching Study Groups Washington, D. C. July 15, 1970</p>
<p>I am no historian, but American history -- history in general--has fascinated me all my life. Despite a heavy work schedule, I have managed to turn myself into a fairly knowledgeable amateur. In any event, I find that current issues are Clarified for me by looking at them in the light of history. I am struck with the similarity of the present to the past, not with its differences as so many others see it, especially the young who have learned very little history in our school system and think the past is not &quot;relevant.&quot; Observing history being made all around me, and reading how it was made in the past, has led me to certain convictions about the American party system. Whether they could be of practical help, I cannot judge. But here they are.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that no party has an assured and long future unless it establishes:‘a convincing, clearly stated connection with the troubles and frustrations, as well as the aims and aspirations, and basic beliefs of a relatively stable majority of the American people. To sense the formation of a new majority is the secret of the successful party. To sense the erosion of an existing majority and profit thereby is part of that secret. I would judge we</p>
<p>are currently in a situation somewhat resembling both the period at the end</p>
<p>of Washington's first administration and during the 1850's.</p>
<p>The Federalists who were chiefly responsible for the creation of our Federal Union and who organized the central government under Washington and Hamilton, failed to convince a majority of the people that their policies-- by enhancing the strength of the Nation politically and economically--were in fact directly beneficial to them as individuals.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of Americans at that time were self-sufficient farmers producing little beyond the needs of their families and perhaps a local market, or they had small shops or were artisans or fishermen. It was not immediately evident to them how they could personally profit from Federalist efforts to build a strong national economy, to secure the credit of the Nation, and to provide a stable currency. It was therefore extremely easy for Jefferson and Madison to win a majority for their new anti-Federalist party-- then called the Republican Party, as you all know--by accusing the opponents of &quot;monarchical&quot; or &quot;aristocratic&quot; tendencies, of being concerned only with the rich and not with the ordinary citizen. On their famous &quot;botanizing&quot; expedition to New York in 1791, Jefferson and Madison forged a coalition of southern planters, western farmers and the poorer segments of northern city people which proved extraordinarily durable. Defeating the Federalists in 1800, the Jeffersonian Republicans controlled the Federal Government for almost three decades, ruling with virtually no national opposition.</p>
<p>The party held together until 1828, when its larger part formed a new coalition of farmers and mechanics under Jackson who called it the &quot;Democracy.&quot; Clay</p>
<p>rallied the dissident remnants in a new party, the Whigs, whose appeal was more</p>
<p>broadly based than that of the Federalists but whose policies were essentially</p>
<p>Hamilton's brought up-to-date. The Whigs wanted to build a large domestic market which would make the country economically independent--tariffs to promote domestic industry, federally aided internal improvements to facilitate overland transport, sound money and a national bank. They, too, failed to convince a stable majority that these were policies benefiting them. Jackson had no difficulty making a case against the Whigs on the grounds of allegedly favoring the rich, the “eastern money&quot; power. Winning occasional victories, the Whigs never held power long enough to carry out their economic program. The seesaw between them and the Democrats down to the Civil War was not unlike the situation we have had since the early 1930's.</p>
<p>Yet the very policies espoused first by the Federalists, then by the Whigs, formed a major part of the platform on which the newly formed Republican Party rode to victory with Lincoln in 1860, and maintained itself in power for half a century thereafter.</p>
<p>I am no expert in political matters; indeed I have no business talking to experts like yourselves on these matters. But if I were concerned with trying to build up your party nationally so that we should have a close equilibrium, with power shifting frequently between the two great parties--more frequently and more completely than in the past 40 years--if this were my job, I should study very carefully how the Republicans of 1860 managed to convince the majority that theirs was a &quot;popular,&quot; not an &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;aristocratic&quot; or &quot;rich man's&quot; party. I suspect it was because they sensed that a large majority in the North were</p>
<p>tired of government by a coalition of minorities. I think it may well be that</p>
<p>something like this is taking place today. Superficially, everything seems</p>
<p>different--today's Americans are different people, the divisive issues are not sectional. But I would guess, that, as of 1860, a majority is in process of formation which does not feel itself fully represented by either of today's two parties.</p>
<p>It is generally thought that our political system functions best when both parties share a large body of similar beliefs and objectives. As Carl Becker said, government by majority performs most successfully when political issues do not tou ~ - deep social and economic divisions. The reason of course is that the minority then finds it relatively easy to accept defeat at the polls--</p>
<p>a lost election does not mean &quot;a fatal surrender of vital interests.&quot; This is true enough in normal times, but not when there is a deep rift in the body politic. Such a rift cannot be bridged unless the parties accurately reflect the opposing views so that conflicts may be settled by majority decision instead</p>
<p>of being allowed to linger on, imperfectly resolved by negotiated compromises-- as was the case during the three decades preceding the Civil War.</p>
<p>Slavery--with all its political, economic and social ramifications--was, of course, the cause of the rift, of the growing alienation between North and South. Yet neither of the two parties took a clear-cut stand on this issue; both evaded it in order to remain &quot;national&quot; parties. Third parties were formed, but they were insignificant and short-lived, none offering a program broad enough to appeal to the majority of &quot;middle&quot; Americans. None, that is, until the advent</p>
<p>of the Republicans.</p>
<p>Combining as it did the economic policies of the Whigs with a promise of homestead legislation (steadfastly voted down by the southern-controlled Democrats) and with a straightforward ban on further extension of slavery into the territories (an old Federalist objective), the 1860 platform of the Republican Party represented the first commitment in years to the interests of a broad segment of the population of the North where there were as yet few social or economic differences and most enterprises were still owner operated. It therefore appealed to independent mill owners, merchants and farmers, as much as to those who w ~ ° for others but had ambitions to become independent--for them the realization of these ambitions was tied to keeping slavery out of the federal territories and making the land available to &quot;free labor&quot; as a safety valve, should industrial conditions worsen, and as an ever present opportunity for everyone willing to face the risk of pioneer life in order to achieve economic independence.</p>
<p>Of those who abandoned old party affiliations and voted Republican in 1860-- and for many decades thereafter--few were rich. Indeed, as is true of most &quot;middle&quot; Americans then and now, great wealth and the power it wields were anathema to them. They disliked rich northern mill owners--the so-called &quot;lords of the loom&quot;--as much as southern slave holding planters--the &quot;lords of the lash.&quot; But what I believe they disliked more than anything else was the coalition of these two which to them was personified in the Democratic Party-- then no longer Jackson's party of the common man--no less then in the Whigs</p>
<p>who put up no strong opposition, being rendered ineffective by their desire to</p>
<p>hold on to their southern constituents. In contrast, the Republicans never</p>
<p>ceased denouncing the &quot;slave power&quot; and its control of the Executive, the Senate, and the Supreme Court, especially the use by the southern minority of the 5th Amendment--as in the Dred Scott case--to bolster their demand for the extension and national protection of slavery. The party never tired of glorifying the dignity of &quot;free labor,&quot; setting it against its debasement where- ever slavery existed. Carl Schurz, endorsing Lincoln's nomination in 1860, summed it all up in the words: &quot;The Republicans stand before the country not only as the antislavery party, but emphatically as the party of free labor.&quot;</p>
<p>The term &quot;free labor then applied to all who worked with their own hands and brains to support themselves and their families. America was to them the country of opportunity for the common man, the one country in the world where he controlled his government. They were, if you will, a &quot;silent majority&quot; become vociferous when they felt that a coalition of minorities above and below &quot;middle&quot; America was perverting the Union of the Pounding Fathers. They believed the society of the North exemplified the best in America, that of the South the worst--a conviction confirmed in every major Republican campaign speech. To them, the determination of the new party to capture the Federal Government and thus end the minority rule of the &quot;slave power&quot; meant a return to the cardinal principles of the American political system, the rule of the majority.</p>
<p>It was this clear-cut commitment to a middle class society, composed of self-reliant people coming up from the ranks of labor, none very rich, but</p>
<p>hardworking, with faith in education and what has come to be called the</p>
<p>&quot;Protestant Ethic&quot;--it was this that distinguished the Republicans of 1860 from the Federalists and Whigs with whom they shared their whole economic philo- sophy. Only when those favoring a strong nation, both economically and politically, tied this Philosophy to the aims of &quot;middle&quot; Americans did they win</p>
<p>a stable and continuing majority. Noone since Lincoln--except perhaps</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt--succeeded SO well in convincing &quot;middle&quot; America that</p>
<p>One might dismiss this as ancient history, but I feel certain that without emulating this identification of Purpose no dependable majority support can be built. The pa =r most natural to the Republican Party is identification with &quot;middle&quot; America. It Cannot be avowedly &quot;conservative&quot; for, in the context of American political values, this would brand it as a party of the rich, Nor, in my judgment, would it have a secure future if it left itself open to the accuSation of disregarding the interests of &quot;middle&quot; Americans in favor of one Or another or a combination of minorities. This would be to build on Sand--at least in the long run, [ may be wrong, but I believe that a large and Stable middle segment is evolving in our Society--not altogether unlike the constituency of the Party in 1860 and for decades thereafter, the segment your Party is inherently best equipped to represent.</p>
<p>Ranging through every economic level, it consists of People who are competent in their own sphere of activity, hardworking, able to make their way on their own. They pay most of the taxes yet receive Proportionately the least benefit from them since, asa group, they are given few if any special Privileges--</p>
<p>no federal Subsidies for them for non-work or plain incompetence, no tax</p>
<p>write offs, no Government contracts yielding high profits--no handouts from</p>
<p>the Government. The issues which today loom large in the eyes of these</p>
<p>people involve no demands on their part for special benefits; they are issues concerning all Americans who contribute to society and are fundamentally in accord with our political system. Such as the need to devise new ways to finance political campaigns out of public funds so that candidates need be neither rich nor obligated to large campaign contributors. To bring about this reform today would be as great a party achievement as was the ban on slavery in the territories in 1860--then as now, effecting a return to the fundamental concept of our political system; government chosen by and accountable to the people or, more precisely, to the current majority of the people. Or take the long over- due reform of our school system. What &quot;middle&quot; Americans want is good</p>
<p>education, not schooling that is used primarily for social experimentation..</p>
<p>They are for law and order in the sense that every civilized person wants it--even- handed administration of justice with no privileged status for anyone; competent and honest police; laws made by the representatives of the elected majority not by self-righteous minorities. They are against the parasites of society whether they be the very rich who escape taxation by gimmickry or the very poor who demand, as they see it, too large a slice of their own hard earned income in taxes.</p>
<p>I need not pursue this further, except to remark, in passing, that it is these people who have contributed an outsize share of men to defend the nation in war. To see the flag trampled and the United States derided, destroys the spiritual</p>
<p>basis of their lives, makes a mockery of their beliefs. I suspect that this</p>
<p>education, in the law, even in the business world.</p>
<p>They are at heart all self-made or would-be self-made men; they sense the</p>
<p>unnaturalness of the PSeudo-psychosociologica] notion that man is but the</p>
<p>I don't know whether any of this might be useful to you, But this is what</p>
<p>Over the years [ have come to believe,</p>
