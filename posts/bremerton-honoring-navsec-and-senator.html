      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his September 11, 1964 remarks, Vice Admiral H.G. Rickover delivered a robust tribute to Secretary of the Navy Paul H. Nitze and Senator Henry M. Jackson, emphasizing their critical roles in the advancement of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s nuclear program and national strength. Rickover underscored the transformative impact of nuclear power, citing impressive statistics such as Polaris submarines operating submerged for 60+ days, the fleet accumulating nearly 4 million miles, and a tenfold reduction in the cost per unit of nuclear energy over a decade. He highlighted the historic 33,000-mile unreplenished world cruise by the USS Enterprise, Long Beach, and Bainbridge. Rickover specifically credited Senator Jackson and the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy for enabling the current fleet of 50 nuclear ships (with another 50 planned) and for the development of Polaris submarines, which proved crucial as a deterrent during the Cuban missile crisis. Beyond military contributions, Rickover lauded Jackson&#x27;s profound dedication to human welfare, posterity, and the preservation of national resources, hailing him as a warm, dedicated patriot.</p>

        <p>‘Ay east &quot;bremerton, “swashington: = september 11, 1964</p>
<p>There is little I can add to what has been waty Tear Nitze and Senator Jackson, I might, of course, cite a number of interesting statisticst that our Polaris submarines spend practically their entire sea-going lives submerged, generally for 60 or more days at a time; that our nuclear ships have steamed close to 4 million miles; that a train of tank cars more than 100 miles long would have been required if they had burned oil; that in the past ten years we have decreased the cost per unit of energy from our nuclear cores by a factor of ten} that our 3 nuclear surface ships, the aircraft carrier ENTERPRISE, the cruiser LONG BEACH, and the frigate BAINBRIDGE, are now on a history-making 33, 000 mile ground the world cruise, and this without replenishment of food or of fuel for the ships themselves or their aircraft.</p>
<p>But all of these facts merely high-light the vast changes which have taken place in the Navy in the last few years, and future changes still td come »</p>
<p>What is important to understand is that nuclear power has radically influenced the technical foundation of our Navy and has. brought with it great internal strain.</p>
<p>In this period of strain, augmented by vast changes among the nations of the world, it is fortunate for the Navy that there are two men in government who thoroughly comprehend the causes of this strain and what must be done swiftly and surely to cope with it. I refer, of course, to Secretary Nitze and Senator Jackson. Our Secretary has devoted most of his working life in the State Department, in the Department of Defense, and most recently in the</p>
<p>Navy Department. He understands the significance of sea power. He knows that</p>
<p>national policy, unbuttressed by military strength, is but a weak reed.</p>
<p>' He is doing everything he can to maintain and augment our naval strength. It is fortunate that he heads our Navy at this critical point of time,</p>
<p>But Secretary Nitze, by himself, cannot accomplish that which he knows to be necessary and to which he is dedicated. He cannot accomplish it without the help and approval of Congress. And it is here that Senator Jackson plays a vital part.</p>
<p>I have known the Senator since the inception of the Navy's nuclear program in 1947. It is largely due to him and to members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy that we now have 50 nuclear ships in operations, and another 50 to be in operation in about 4 years, It is largely due to his foresight and determination that it was possible to get backing for this revolutionary type of ship which many in the Navy were dubious about and did not wish to support.</p>
<p>That today we have Polaris submarines which are a major deterrent to aggression against the United States -- the deterrent which probably, more than any other factor helped resolve the Cuban crisis, is in large measure due to your Senator and his colleagues on the Atomic Energy Committee.</p>
<p>But his work in Congress extends far beyond what he has done to keep our country strong in a military way. There is another side to Senator Jackson which I consider even more important. As we grow older we realize that the only permanent value in life is the way we live with our fellow men. We are all children of God; each of us is heir to all that has been accomplished by every human being who has ever lived. For this reason each of us is responsible for the welfare of all mankind.</p>
<p>In the many years it has been my privilege to know Senator Jackson, I have found him to be a warm, dedicated human being. His friends in the State of Washington know at firsthand of his generous humanity and his sincere friendship. Many of us in Washington and elsewhere in the United States also know this</p>
<p>and respect him for these human qualities.</p>
<p>He devotes himself, not only to the welfare of present citizens of the United States; he devotes himself also to the welfare of our posterity -- our future citizens. All of us are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. Our ancestors came here to find a better way of life for themselves and their children. Today Senator Jackson's services to his country are high-lighted by his efforts to make us strong. But on the day when men finally learn that war is an abomination in the eyes of the Lord, then will it be recognized what Senator Jackson has done to preserve our natural resources and the beauty of our land *- to preserve that which we are in duty bound to leave to our descendants.</p>
<p>I consider it one of the great rewards of my work that I have been privileged to associate with and hold the friendship of so fine a patriot</p>
<p>and man -- a man whose accomplishments do so much honor to his native State.</p>
