      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1968 remarks at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, Admiral Rickover underscored the critical importance of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), crediting Congressman Samuel S. Stratton as Chairman of the ASW Subcommittee. Rickover detailed the historical threat of submarines, noting Germany&#x27;s success in sinking 11 million tons of shipping in WWI with just 47 submarines, and 14 million tons in WWII, contrasting these with modern nuclear submarines&#x27; indefinite submerged endurance and high speeds. He highlighted the significant contemporary threat posed by the Soviet Union&#x27;s 350 submarines, including 50 nuclear ones. Rickover then showcased the impressive growth and technological prowess of the U.S. nuclear navy, stating 108 nuclear submarines were authorized (77 operational by 1968, including 41 Polaris and 36 attack subs), and detailing innovations like the NR-1 deep-sea research submarine, the USS *Seawolf* (first to stay submerged for 60 days), and the USS *Triton* (first to circumnavigate the globe submerged in 83 days). He also mentioned nuclear surface ships like the USS *Enterprise* and the upcoming USS *Nimitz*, emphasizing the fleet&#x27;s 12 million miles steamed without reactor failure, a $14 billion investment, and extensive training of 15,300 sailors and 2,800 officers in the nuclear propulsion program.</p>

        <p>Mr. Stratton is here today as Chairman of the Anti-Submerine Warfare Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. He is interested in seeing the contributions the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory is making in this field, particularly with respect to the reactor for the fast submarine recently approved by the Congress. The ASW subcommittee was formed in 1966 at the suggestion of Mr. Stratton. {Tt was during a tour of duty with the Naval Reserves that Mr. Stratton studied the problems associated with the detection and tracking of nuclear submarines. He thought them important enough to the security of our country that he reported on them to the Committee. The subcommittee was formed immediately thereafter and Mr. Stratton</p>
<p>has been Chairman ever since. In this capacity he has made numerous investigations and heard much testimony on this most important matter.</p>
<p>You will remember that WW I was nearly lost because of German adimar lies. The Germans sank 5500 ships totalling 11 million tons. At one time in April, 1917, 4 month in which the Allies lost over a million tons of shipping, there was only four days of food and munitions left for the Allied Armies in France. And all this was accomplished with only 47 submarines at sea at any one time.</p>
<p>In World War II the Germans sank 2759 ships totalling 14 million tons. And all</p>
<p>of you know how very close we cameto losing both wars. But many people do not</p>
<p>know that it took 20% of the entire war effort to combat these submarines.</p>
<p>But the WW I and II subs could make only 10 knots for l hour. Today, nuclear submarines can remain submerged indefinitely and steam at high speeds.</p>
<p>the 350 modern submarines the Russians have, including 50 nuclear ones, represent</p>
<p>a great threat to us. From these figures you can understand the importance of Congressman Stratton's work in ASW. He is doing a great service to our Country and to our families by</p>
<p>helping us to protect curselves.</p>
<p>Page 2. It has been a great pleasure and a privilege for me to be associated with such</p>
<p>conscientious man. He is patriotic, hard-working. He is devoted to his country,</p>
<p>to his state and to his district. He combines the rare ability of being able to balance the national interest with that of his own constituency. It is always a pleasure to go to him for his kindly advice. | The United States now has 108 nuclear submarines authorized. Of this number 77</p>
<p>are in operation, 41 Polaris and 36 attack submarines. 31 more are under | construction, 30 attack submarines and the NR-1 which is a small nuclear powered</p>
<p>research submarine capable of going to great depths and exploring the ocean bottom.</p>
<p>This submarine will be able to remain submerged for periods of time limited only</p>
<p>by the amount of food, water, and supplies she can cCarrye She will carry a crew</p>
<p>of 7. She will map and make studies of the ocean bottom for military, commercial</p>
<p>and scientific purposes.</p>
<p>This submarine will have viewing ports for visual observation of its surroundings</p>
<p>and of the ocean bottom. In addition, a remote grapple will be installed to</p>
<p>permit collection of marine samples and other items. With its depth capability,</p>
<p>the NR-1 will be capable of exploring the Continental Shelf, an area which appears</p>
<p>to contain the most accessible wealth in mineral and food resources in the seas.</p>
<p>Such exploratory charting may also help the United States to establish sovereignty</p>
<p>over parts of the Continental Shelf. A submarine with the NR-ls depth capability</p>
<p>is capable of exploring an area several times that of the United States.</p>
<p>As for the 41 Polaris submarines, each of which carries 16 ballistic missiles:</p>
<p>They have been declared to be the closest approach now forseeable to an ultinate deterrent .</p>
<p>In addition to our nuclear submarines, there have also been authorized a total of 7 nuclear surface warships. Four of these, the aircraft carrier Enterprise, the</p>
<p>eruiser Long Beach, and the frigates Bainbridge and Truxton are now in operation.</p>
<p>Page 3.</p>
<p>Amother aircraf* carrier, the Nimitz is under construction, and the contracts for two more frigates have been placed.</p>
<p>In 1966, in what was known 4s Operation Sea Orbit, 3 of our nuclear surface ships, the Enterprise, the Long Beach and the Bainbridge circumnavigated the</p>
<p>globe, steaming 31,000 miles in 65 days. | Our nuclear ships have now steamed over 12 million miles during which no mission has ever had to be cancelled because of the failure of the reactor plant. These ships represent an investment of 14 billion dollars. 450 contractors are involved in their design and puilding. These consist of 150 large contractors and 300 small businesses. Four private shipyards and 6 Navy Yards are involved in their building and repair. |</p>
<p>In the Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program we operate 6 schools, one of which is</p>
<p>at West Milton, New York. We have now trained 15,300 sailors and 2800 officers. The Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, which is aparated by the General Electric Company for the Atomic Energy Commission has been responsible for many new types of nuclear submarines and surface ships.</p>
<p>The first was the submarine Seawolf, the world's first successful sodium cooled reactor. The Seawolf was the first submarine in all history to remain completely submerged for as long as 60 days.</p>
<p>Next was the submarine Triton, the largest submarine ever built up to that time. She was the fist submarine to circumnaviage the globe while fully submerged.</p>
<p>She steamed 36,000 miles for 83 days to do this.</p>
<p>Then came the Narwhal which is designed to be very quiet and should be in operation early next year.</p>
<p>Then there is the NR-1 which will be used to explore the ocean bottom. The Knolls</p>
<p>Laboratory will be engaged in designing the new fast submarine.</p>
<p>Page 4. = for muclear surface ships, the Knolls Laboratory designed our first mmuclear frigate, the Bainbridge and is now designing the new aircraft carrier Nimitz. This ship will Mepiace 91,300 tons and will be powered by — 2 nuclear reactors instead of the 8 in the Enterprise. These two reactors</p>
<p>will last for 13 years and will provide energy equal to 10 million barrels of</p>
<p>cil, or about 2 million tons of oil.</p>
