        <p>Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Navy Concerning Congressman Joseph G. Minish - January 4, 1977</p>
<p>I would like to say a few words about my good friend, Congressman</p>
<p>_ Joseph Minish,</p>
<p>He is a man who knows where he stands on every question of life and affairs to an unusual degree. He has a warm heart and gift for friend- Ship. He is one of those beings whose pace of life is faster and more intense than the ordinary. | He is a sincere patriot; a wise, grave, sober- minded statesman; and a gay brilliant, loyal lovable being.</p>
<p>He remains inflexibly attached to first principles. He rarely traduces men's motives; he sometimes regards their decisions as foolish or founded on inadequate information.</p>
<p>His chief virtue is courage: and to brave men most things can be forgiven. Another virtue of importance is 'honor'. When presented before the bar of history men will have to answer the question whether in a crisis they acted honorably.</p>
<p>The single, central, Organizing principle of his moral and intellectual universe is a strong and comprehensive and historical imagination.</p>
<p>He knows a great deal about the Renegotiation Board, and far more than most of the so-called experts in this field. He has been in the vanguard of those farsighted members of Congress dedicated to protecting the public</p>
<p>interest in this field. 1</p>
<p>I am particularly grateful to him for the unfailing support he has</p>
<p>given to our efforts to protect the Government's interests. For this, the United States owes him a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>- It was his committee which held special hearings in 1975 to bring</p>
<p>‘into focus the need for strengthening the Renegotiation Board.</p>
<p>He permits nothing to deter him from doing his duty to the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>In the business of government, any movement from hideous to bad</p>
<p>is progress, from hideous to fair is spectacular. And Congressman</p>
<p>Minish has done more than his share to achieve the spectacular for us. - He does not agree with many of our pseudo-intellectuals who are drowning in their own words and suffocating in their own documents.</p>
<p>He thinks that knowledge is preferable to ignorance; human sympathy more valuable than ideology. That in spite of the recent triumphs of science, men have not changed much, and in consequence we must still try to learn from history.</p>
<p>Future generations will, Iam sure, remember him above all for</p>
<p>what he has done to preserve our heritage than for anything else.</p>
