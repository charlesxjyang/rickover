      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman George Rickover, the influential Navy figure, predicted a significant expansion for the Naval Reactor Facilities (NRF) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) during a 1979 visit, emphasizing its crucial role in reactor servicing, fuel inspection, and as a core training and research hub for the nuclear Navy. He highlighted the facility&#x27;s approximate $45 million annual budget from the Navy (with an additional $25 million from other INEL facilities) and its vital function in manning the nuclear-powered fleet, noting that over 40% of the Navy&#x27;s major combatant ships were nuclear-powered. Rickover also acknowledged Senator Frank Church&#x27;s strong support for the program, which he stated greatly benefits the community, and provided detailed figures on personnel trained (18,000 enlisted and 3,000 officers over 25 years) and current staff (800 civilians, 550 naval staff, 800 in training). Despite his famously abrupt manner, the 79-year-old admiral, fresh off a Congressional extension, expressed enthusiasm for the program&#x27;s future and even lightheartedly commented on Navy men marrying Idaho girls, reflecting on his long-standing connection to the site.</p>

<p>Rickover predicts widening</p>
<p>future for Idaho Falls’ NRF</p>
<p>By BEN J. PLASTINO Post-Register executive editor</p>
<p>Admiral Hyman George Rickover, the hardy Navy boss who made the nuclear concept seaworthy, Friday predicted a fu-</p>
<p>ire at the Naval Reactor Facilities at the idaho National Engineering Laboratory as</p>
<p>xpansive at the seven oceans</p>
<p>He came to tour the Naval Reactor facili- lies, which he heads, in one of his quick unannounced trips, but took time at the Idaho Falls Airport for an interview.</p>
<p>“The work at the Naval Reactor Tacility will increase over the next several years,” he said pointedly. ** This increase consists of tor servicing and fuel inspection and will imariiy temporary in nature. Over the term, there will be a continuing need r the work that is performed at the site.” Rickover, now 79, was voted a (wo year tention by Congress last we ek to continue</p>
<p>nder of the Navy's nuclear power He ¢ ned to say whether he</p>
<p>full term his sharp,</p>
<p>V abrupt manner, he theless appeared in good spirits under the bright Idaho sun as he strolled to the iirport</p>
<p>Phu his beloved NRF program at the INE L, which he helpe ed establish, he ted, “The NRF is one of the three naval lear propulsic mn plant training facilities he only facility for inspecting and</p>
<p>ynsequentiy,” he added, ‘‘the NRF is a key facility for training the operators need- ed fo man the Navy's nuclear powered fleet and for the ongoing naval nuclear propulsion research and development program. With over 40 percent of the Navy's major com- batant ships nuclear-powered, the activities at the NRF plan an integral and essential part in a significant aspect of our national | defense ”'</p>
<p>Asked about Idaho's U.S. Sen. Frank Church actions on the naval reactor programs, Rickover replied, ‘‘In his capacity as chairman of the subcommittee on energy research and development of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Church oversses authorization of funds for work that is carried out at the Naval Reactors Facility Site.</p>
<p>“Senator Church has been a strong sup- porter of the naval reactors program, which contributes not only to our national defense, but also to the economic well being of this area. From my perspective, Senator Church has done a good job for the naval reactors program and | appreciate his support.”</p>
<p>The crusty admiral, however, curtly said he would not answer any political questions, including what he thinks of President Carter. Carter was one of his proteges as a young navy lieutenant, who made trips to the INEL soon after graduating for the Naval Academy.</p>
<p>Frail of stature but with a sparkle in his eyes, the admiral noted that in fiscal year 1979, about 1,000 enlisted personnel and 160</p>
<p>naval officers were training at NRF. Since training began at the site 25 years ago, a total of about 18,000 enlisted personnel and 3,000 officers have completed training there, he said.</p>
<p>He added there are about 800 civilians, 550 naval staff and a training class of about 800 now at NRF-</p>
<p>Rickover said the Naval Reactors Facility budget is approximately $45 million year. In addition, approximately $25 millior in work for the Naval Reactors program is accomplished each year by other INEL facilities, primarily the Advanced Tesi Reactor facility and Chemical Reprocessing Plant.</p>
<p>Asked why he didn’t call The Post Register when he came here, he did in the early years, he brusquely replied, ‘‘News papers don’t get things right anyway.”</p>
<p>He did acknowledge, however, that The Post-Register has been a warm supporte! for the INEL, adding, ‘‘This naval progran has done a lot for this community.”</p>
<p>He then discussed with enthusiasm one o} his favorite topics, the fact that the Navy men stationed here frequently marry Idahc girls.</p>
<p>“The boys,”’ he said, ‘‘can’t resist the beauty and tenderness of the girls from Idaho.”</p>
<p>‘“‘Now,”’ he said, “‘young man (appreciate the compliment), that’s all the questions I’m going to answer.”</p>
<p>This writer reminded him he had inter- viewed Rickover some 20 years ago at the time the navy program here was getting in high gear.</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember that,&quot;’ he said, then picked up his portfolio and strode to a Wes: tern Airlines desk to board a Friday after- noon flight. He had arrived here Thursday night.</p>
