      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Delivered at sea in the North Atlantic on February 9, 1981, Admiral Rickover&#x27;s remarks commemorate the successful initial sea trials of the USS *San Francisco*, commending the engineers and craftsmen of Newport News for their excellent work and praising Commander Marshall and his crew for their outstanding performance, despite many being new to sea duty. Beyond the technical report, Rickover delivers a &quot;homily,&quot; reflecting on the vast changes from his early 20th-century childhood—a time of horses and darkness—to the modern era of nuclear weapons, space travel, and the silicon chip. He laments a perceived societal shift, noting the absence of a &quot;unifying faith&quot; and a decline in reliance on reason and common sense. Rickover passionately advocates for a rebirth of honorable conduct, confidence in human reason, and national pride, asserting these non-material ideals are fundamental to a nation&#x27;s true greatness.</p>

<p>Admiral rickover’s remarks on the san francisco sea trials</p>
<p>We have just completed the first sea trials of the san francisco. The propulsion plant operated satisfactorily,</p>
<p>I want once again to congratulate the engineers and craftsmen of newport news for their excellent work, evidenced by these successful trials. The men and women of newport news continue the tradition of shipbuilding competence the navy counts on.</p>
<p>] especially want to congratulate the officers and men of the san francisco. Anyone witnessing these trials would find it hard to believe that only half the crew has been to sea before these trials except for short training periods.</p>
<p>The men and officers of the ship have demonstrated they are capable of doing an outstanding job. I know you will contine to perform your duties in this same outstanding manner. Our country should be proud of commander marshall, his officers, and his men,</p>
<p>In behalf of the navy I thank all of you for a job well done.</p>
<p>Since no church services could be held in the san francisco this sunday, I AM taking advantage of this occasion to deliver a little homily:</p>
<p>I was born in the first year of this century and experienced a childhoood which had not changed much since that of the time of the civil war. I now live in the age of the nuclear weapon, space travel, and the silicon chip. These diverse experiences make me feel as though I have been a participant in two separate lives. But I AM still much the same person I was in those early</p>
<p>Ons: there were then no automobiles on the road; horses were still ‘man’s most important companion and friend from the animal world. At night with*no electricity, there was total darkness). Only lit by the moon or stars, except for the barking of a dog or the hoof-beats of a horse, it was quiet, _ in the present age there 1S no unifying faith 79 bind US together: in its place there 1S only a hale-hearted adherence to many conflicting and divisive forms of ideolsgical or emotional nonsense,</p>
<p>Another attribute of that vanished age which distinguished it from that of the present day was a reliance of reasons on the cumulative knowledge of the pasts on common sense, instead of “pop”, or fashion or craze,</p>
<p>Despite the vast improvement in living and social conditions and the great technical and scientific advances that 1 have witnessed in my lifetime, there is one thing I should like to see reborn which is missing in the materially guided united, states</p>
<p>And dealings; a confidence in men and women of all classes and</p>
<p>Callings in their own capacity for reason and good sense; and</p>
<p>A pride in our country and its achievements, past, present and</p>
<p>Future. . This was formerly shared by aristocrat, bourgeois and working</p>
<p>People alike, these, despite all the differences in their</p>
<p>Individual circumstances and ways of life, made US united as</p>
<p>One nation, and these ideals, which cannot be served by money</p>
<p>Alone, are what make a people great. And what our people are ~</p>
<p>1S what our country is,</p>
