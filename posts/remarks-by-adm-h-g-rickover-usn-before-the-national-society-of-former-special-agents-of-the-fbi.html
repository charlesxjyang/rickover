      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this August 30, 1974 speech to the National Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, Admiral H.G. Rickover delivers a scathing critique of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s post-World War II decline in technical competence, attributing it to an over-reliance on &quot;management systems&quot; and an excessive bureaucracy. He laments the lack of hands-on engineering experience among line officers and ship captains, contrasting this sharply with the rigorous qualification standards he implemented in the nuclear Navy. Rickover argues that the Naval Academy&#x27;s curriculum has shifted too far from engineering, citing a midshipman&#x27;s focus on &quot;mouse biorhythms&quot; as an example of misdirected education. He advocates for fundamental structural changes, including a return to a &quot;bilinear system&quot; where technical bureaus report directly to the Secretary of the Navy, the disbandment of the Chief of Naval Material&#x27;s office, and a renewed emphasis on developing in-house technical capability and long-term assignments for engineering personnel to ensure the Navy&#x27;s warfighting readiness.</p>

        <p>Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, USN before the National Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;</p>
<p>Seattle, Washington; August 30, 1974</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, I have witnessed the deterioration of the technical competence of the Navy when compared to the job the Navy has todo. This deterioration has affected both the operating engineers at sea and the design engineers ashore.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Navy has become lost in its organizational complexity. New layers of administrators and managers, civilian and naval are interposed between the high echelons of the Navy and the people who are doing the actual work. These managers are empowered to ask any and all questions and to stop technical work from proceeding. Their endorsement must be obtained prior to forwarding a recommendation to higher authority in the chain of command. But there is no one that I can find in the Naval Material Command who has the authority to approve proceeding with programs.</p>
<p>The growing dependence upon management systems has been another characteristic which has evolved in the years since World War II.</p>
<p>Secretary McNamara, instead of requiring the Navy to build up its</p>
<p>in-house technical capability, decreed that it should depend on industry, The Navy was to &quot;manage&quot; the projects which it assigned to industry, His successors have followed the same path,</p>
<p>Management systems and gimmicks are now as endemic to the Government as the Black Plague was in Medieval Europe,</p>
<p>What if Columbus had applied modern management systems to his proposed voyage? He would have attended management seminars, He would have studied tables with brightly colored Squares and broad arrows to show which way plans, decisions, and problems were to go. He would not have bothered with details such as navigation and seamanship. These were technical matters, He would simply have &quot;managed&quot; the voyage. He would have used a colored-plastic decision-making card. Further, his analyst—I mean systems analyst—would have presented him with several volumes proving that the venture was not cost-effective, America would</p>
<p>never have been discovered. We would all be Indians,</p>
<p>In my opinion, there has been no period in the past 50 years where the Fleet has been in aS poor condition as it is today. It appears to me that the prime reason for the inability of the officers of the Fleet to Supervise their equipment is their lack of training.</p>
<p>On non-nuclear surface ships, officers are no longer required to qualify as operating engineers. Contrary to the practice before World War II, there are now no requirements for the captain of a ship even to</p>
<p>have served in the engineering department before he takes command.</p>
<p>The result is that many captains have little knowledge, respect, or regard for their engineering plants; they do not know how to make a critical inspection of these plants, nor can they even evaluate the recommendations of their people. Is it any wonder that ships— even new ones—are frequently found in poor material condition by outside inspectors ?</p>
<p>The emphasis on operational experience is just the opposite in nuclear ships. Since the beginning, I have required all nuclear ship</p>
<p>captains, as well as their subordinate officers, to qualify as operators</p>
<p>of the propulsion plant before being assigned to a ship. Prior to being assigned as chief engineer, executive officer, or captain of a nuclear ship, the nuclear trained officer must successfully complete a comprehensive eight-hour written examination and a three-hour oral examination at my headquarters in Washington. I personally approve or disapprove all examination results. Before he is permitted to take this examination, he must first have completed one year of academic and operational training which includes qualification as a watch officer on a fully operational, land prototype nuclear propulsion plant similar to the ones we have at sea. An engineering department officer, once he has completed his initial training, must qualify as a watch officer in a nuclear ship and serve in the engineering department for at least one year. To be eligible for the examination, he must also be</p>
<p>recommended by his commanding officer.</p>
<p>These requirements produce line officers who are familiar with the operating details of their propulsion plants and are not afraid to get their hands dirty. When reports from subordinates conflict, or where they doubt the accuracy, they know enough to look for themselves and to put the weight of their own experience behind the decision.</p>
<p>Line officers must be taken out of technical positions they are not qualified to hold. The aimless way in which the line officers have taken over engineering in the Navy in the last ten years has just about destroyed the engineering capacity of the Navy.</p>
<p>The staff of the Chief of Naval Operations has grown in recent years, until it now includes 65 admirals. This is about twice as many as were assigned to Fleet Admiral King's staff at the height of World War IL. These admirals, along with literally hundreds of other staff officers get involved in technical matters for which they have no qualifications, Recently, I attended a Chief of Naval Operations meeting at which the only subject discussed was technical ship characteristics. In addition to the large number of line admirals present, there was also a Marine general—although the meeting had nothing to do with the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>He volunteered no comments; how could he?</p>
<p>Line officers ashore seem to spend much time on matters outside of their responsibility or experience. This is reminiscent of a period after World War I when, instead of devoting full time to the condition of our ships, top Navy officials spent time on unimportant matters. As an example, between World Wars I and II the Secretary of the Navy promulgated</p>
<p>a General Order—the highest type of official directive that can be issued—</p>
<p>concerning the Navy's homing pigeon establishment. This Order divided responsibilities for the care and operation of pigeons among the Bureau of Engineering, the Bureau of Construction and Repair, the Bureau of Navigation, and the Director of Naval Communications. All these organizations were involved in pigeons at one time or another, Their responsibilities included, among other things, pigeon population and banding, transportation, housing and food. There were also plans and literature concerning the pigeon service, miscellaneous equipment, and other</p>
<p>pigeon problems. The pigeon service has now been abandoned by the Navy. That, along</p>
<p>with the disbanding of the last detachment of Indian Scouts in 1943, and the requirement for Army aviators to wear spurs in 1938, is one of the rare occasions in U.S. military history where a function has been abolished.</p>
<p>Today —with the inflated rank in the Navy— if we still had the pigeon service—the senior pigeon in the pecking order would, I suppose, be a line admiral. It would be claimed, as the argument so often goes, he needed this rank to deal effectively with his peers in the Army, the Air Force, and the other foreign pigeon services.</p>
<p>Today, many of our naval leaders are actually &quot;cheerleaders,&quot; making heroic attempts to keep the Navy together with endless</p>
<p>exhortations and lectures on the value of leadership. Yet they,</p>
<p>themselves, are not knowledgeable enough to instruct or to see that</p>
<p>the work has been done properly. What we must recognize is that the purpose of the Navy is to defend the country, not to provide a place for comfortable careers. Because our officers are the cutting edge of our military strength, we can make no compromise with their ability.</p>
<p>Management is taught at Annapolis. This has done serious harm to its young graduates. My people and I interview midshipmen before they enter the nuclear program. One midshipman, who had taken management courses, told me that he was able to learn my job in six months; he could run General Electric in a year.</p>
<p>It was not his fault. It was no crime for him to give this answer. He had been taught by his supposedly responsible and knowledgeable professors that his job was to &quot;manage,&quot;'. . . that a naval officer shouldn't bother with technical details. Yet, the devil is in the details.</p>
<p>The service academies once gave professional education in engineering. But since the end of World War II, Annapolis, at least, has changed. It has added more and more social science courses so that it now produces men more fitted for civilian life —if even for that—than for a career in the Navy. Even rewards for scholastic ability do not</p>
<p>lead midshipmen further toward their careers. I recently learned of a</p>
<p>midshipman who will spend his senior year studying ''The Effects of</p>
<p>Low Frequency Electromagnetic Field on the Circadian Biorhythms of Common Mice.&quot; We are raising a generation of naval officers who are ill-equipped to carry out their jobs in peace or war. Does a naval officer need to know the rhythms of mice ?</p>
<p>We should return to the bilinear system, in which the technical bureaus reported directly to the Secretary of the Navy. They should no longer report through the Chief of Naval Material to the Chief of Naval Operations. The entire office of the Chief of Naval Material with its huge staff should be recognized as the huge burden it is, and disbanded. Not only would this step relieve those engaged in technical work from unnecessary meetings and paperwork, it would allow the Chief of Naval Operations to cut back on the size of his office. He could then face his primary job: seeing to it that the Navy is ready for war.</p>
<p>The line officer has a professional responsibility to learn how to operate his ship and his fleet. From his experience, he should be able</p>
<p>to say what kinds of ships the Navy needs to meet its obligations.</p>
<p>Translating those requirements into operational hardware is the job of the engineering officers and the civilian engineers. These men must be forced to learn their job and assume responsibility for their work.</p>
<p>To do this requires long-term assignments. We can no longer permit</p>
<p>officers to hold their position for a short time before moving on to their next job. The headquarters organization responsible for the design and construction of ships should be reestablished as a technical organization with its engineers returned to positions requiring them to be responsible for the technical state of affairs instead of being field consultants. As</p>
<p>the Navy gains technical competence, it can build up its in-house technical capability, and demand high quality work at reasonable cost from the</p>
<p>industrial contractors.</p>
<p>Unpleasant facts are unwelcome and no one builds statues to critics. But today we are not quite as impatient of a critic as the ancient Locrians. These people gave freedom of speech to all citizens. At public meetings anyone could stand up and argue for changes in law or custom, on one condition. A rope was placed around his neck before he began to speak and, if what he said did not meet with public approval, he was forthwith hanged. ‘That, no doubt, prevented disturbing the even tenor of familiar customs and ways of life. Ihave encountered some in the Navy who look with nostalgia on this ancient custom.</p>
<p>Today we have new leadership in the Navy and the Department of Defense. I hope these men will give serious thought to reestablishing</p>
<p>engineering competence in the Navy.</p>
