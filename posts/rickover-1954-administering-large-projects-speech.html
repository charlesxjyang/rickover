      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1954 address, Admiral Hyman Rickover outlines his philosophy for &quot;Administering a Large Military Development Project,&quot; emphasizing that effective management centers on people, not just technical facts. He challenges traditional notions of leadership, asserting that a &quot;God-like&quot; figure possessing all virtues is impossible, and advocates for a &quot;political approach&quot; to achieve objectives, even citing George Washington&#x27;s use of politics in appointments. Rickover details the development of the naval nuclear propulsion program as a case study, highlighting the importance of individual initiative, continuous training, personal responsibility, and the strategic acquisition of &quot;Hunting Licenses&quot; (official authorizations) and funding from agencies like the AEC. He critiques organizational inertia, short tours of duty, and &quot;over-coordination,&quot; stressing the need for leaders who can foster open-mindedness, challenge rules, learn from failure, and integrate scientific research with technological application, ultimately seeking to make scientists and engineers work in harmony.</p>

<p>Ruring the vast Lifteon years I have addressed the students of the</p>
<p>Posteraduste School at Annapolis on 2 number of occasions. My talks heave<br>etl been confined to technical matters, and they have not required exten-<br>. sive preparation, beceuse I was talking about datters faniliar to ne, and</p>
<p>vhich dealt with things, with engineering facte, which I coulda diecuss with</p>
<p>_ some fncility and with objectivity.<br>Sub when one talke about how a job 42 dons, he necessarily talks about<br>peonle, ani not about things. He enters the realu of the subjective. His<br>_ thoushts and his actiong stem from his personality, fron his om experience,<br>from hie own view of things. &quot;The temétntion is strong to talk in goneraite<br>| ties, to define eccomplishmert in texms of standards of ormanization; or to<br>| stress the ofterepeatad qualities of leatership, ‘such og AIntellivonce, wicdon,<br>; honssty, virtues, tact, grace, sgressiveness, huni lity, courege, tenncity, ond<br>- So on - in other words to describe not a man but who possesses tio cbtributes<br>of a God,<br>In my younger days I was pyothered ty these eriteria, Somehow, thinzs<br>uu Just didn&#x27;t work out the way the hooks on administration end on losdership<br>weld they should, and I early beceme aware that I could never qualify as a |<br>leader, if it were really necessary that I possess the twenty or so qualie |<br>- thes most books or articles on leadership claimed te be necessary. So far,<br>. I havo found no one in the Nevy or in industry who possesses more then a<br>fow of thees qualities, and co I have rezretfally come to the conclusion<br>that ths only person who ever possessed all of them died some 1900 years ez.<br>I mention this because the quest for the Snnoasihle may so condition<br>ug 2g to prevent us from accomplishing ths yoesibdie.</p>
<p>“olitics has teen detinad as the art of the possible. In my opinion,</p>
<p>politicians ara those men who more face up to the realities of the world<br>ard of mankind, then any other grou of citizens. A politician must set<br>things gone, or ha loses offices,<br>T commend to you the politica? approach towards accomplishing objectives.</p>
<p>. ne thing that can be said for it is that 1+ works. 4A very eminent Secretary<br>| ‘of the Navy, iy. Forrestal, onea saids &quot;Government without polities is<br>Like conception without sex.&quot; And 4¢ will probably surprise you to iow |<br>- that even George Vashington practiced politice 4n the appolatment and /<br>promotion of officers when he considered 1% necessary to do so for ths<br>, public good. He once wrote: |</p>
<p>‘Sut if officers will not see into the political motives by<br>which I am sometines governed in my appointments, and which the<br>mood of the common enusa renders indi spensably necessary, it is<br>unfortunate; but 1% cannot, because it ought not, divert me from<br>tha nrsctice of a duty, which I think promotes the interests of<br>the United States, and is consistent with the view of that<br>power under which 2 nat,<br>=ha development of naval nuclear propulsion plants is a good exan ole<br>&#x27; of how one goes about getting a job done. It 18 a good subject to study |<br>for nethods, becnuse 1% involves not only the accomplishment of a vecos-<br>ninod diffiewlt techaical operation, tn which emenditura of hundreds of<br>millions of dollars is necessary, but also because it involves the intl-<br>; mate working tomether of tvo large governmontal orzmisationa, the Usvy<br>on on the ones hand, and a civilian orzant zation, she Atomile Enerey</p>
<p>~2n</p>
<p>Comission, on the other. It has involved the establishment of procedures</p>
<p>= and wayo.of doiria government business for which there was no precedent,</p>

<p>woot 4% gome point, sooner or later,<br>orem’ entions lend their nemes to’ a project, but the concent and the Initial<br>- wor&#x27;t 4 always started by on individual, This is difficult for military<br>weoole to comprehend, because they ars used to operating mier a rolatively<br>niga 4rmorsonal aystem. Offictal letters, for exomle, are written in |<br>the third person; the Sumgarancg ig thet &amp; Bureau or an Office does sone~<br>thing. It should be obvious that Burenna and Offices are insninate, and |<br>- therefore carmot generate ideas or do things.<br>Zar}y in 1046 the Nanhattan District decided to. build an atomic power<br>. pile to demonstrate penesful avplication of atomic energy. Industry, £2 |<br>. well ag the Amy, Rav$ and Air Corns, vere invited to perticipate in the<br>+ technical work at Oak Aides. Several officera and civilians were sent hy<br>the Uavy. I was the senior one of the group. All of the neval officers<br>.ené the civilian engineers were sent as individuals to be essigned by the<br>Kanhatten Dietrict as they considered necessary. At Oak Ridge the Navy<br>people ware assigned to various disconnected activities and no serious |<br>. thought was given to their education. i goon realized that voless the<br>“ivy people were organt sed into a unit and their training and education<br>tystematd zed we vould comlote our year&#x27;s stay at Oak Ridge and still not<br>he srepared to commence work on an atonie propulsion plant. Since the</p>
<p>+ Sureau of Ships was in no position formally to request such organization,</p>
<p>-3e</p>
<p>I established versonnl relations with the military and selentific people<br>at Oak Kidge, and soon all of the Navy people were aseigned to me. I<br>arrenged for their seneral education dn nuclear mattors, and, in addition,<br>‘eesigned ench one 2 specialty in which he was to become proficient. The<br>_ Tesult was thet by ‘the tine we left Ons Ridge we had the nucleus of a<br> -tecknierl orzand sation.<br>‘The oreparation and the writing of reports is a tedions and wnveleoe.<br>_ gob, when one 4s already devoting moat of hie time to study. But I kmew<br>| that it was important that the Chter of the Buresu understend vhat we were oF<br>&quot; doing. So I compiled a list of reports which were to be prepared during<br>_ the year and essicned them to individusls to prepare. The result was, that<br>ones every two wocks &amp; report covering 4 spocific technical subject was<br>sent out. ‘hese reports served two valuable purvorses; they forced the<br>. Students to learn the specialized subject, and at the semo tine they served<br>ts educate the leading paowle in the Bureau of the actual statue of nuclear<br>power.<br>the next step was to select a muiteblo navel vessel, and a suitable<br>reactor to be developed. After considerable disausston we agresd that<br>the subserine offered the greatest promise, and that a thermal neutron,<br>water cooled reactor, the beat propulsion plant.<br>Betause we were closely organi zed and fairly well trained in nuclear<br>technolozy in aécordance vith vhat was known. at the time, we were in a<br>“position to take adyantoge of any opportunity which might arise. Such<br>om opportuni ty goon cane. |<br>Bec ause work on the power pile at Oak Ridge ¢ ase not pan out -vell,</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>the “tonde Energy Comnission, which hed replaced the Nanhattan District,</p>
<p>| decided to cancel the project. Becnuse we were on the spot, becauss we<br>were organized as a grows and knew what we “wanted, we were able, without</p>
<p>- the Vashineton authorities realizing it, to divert the people ang the offort<br>- at On Ridge to the atudy of a submarine nile.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, we all returned to “achington. The naval grow</p>
<p>| wes broken up and assigned to different duties. Wavertheless I continued<br>in ny effort to achieve nuclear propalsion for-a sabmorine. There was now<br>&amp; ztoup of scientists end engineers studying the problem at ate Ridga, but<br>‘no anthorizetion for the work, and no requirement for a nuclear submarine<br>by tha Favy.. Obviously 1t was only a matter of a short time before the<br>work would be terminated, unless the Navy itself decided it wanted an atonie |<br>- gubacrine ond suscecded in couvincing the Atomic Shorey Conni sation that it<br>was important. ,</p>
<p>30 the next aten was to obtain a &quot;Hunting License*. This is a piece</p>
<p>feo</p>
<p>of pnger which authorizes one to do a certain thing. It is frecuently</p>
<p>_enlled a directive, or sone much descriptive tora. One must have such a</p>
<p>fe : piece of paper as a &quot;Huhting License&quot;in Governnent, «if he 13 to gat anye<br>| thing dons. | —<br>Contrary to what most navel officers balievs, nerticularly those uho<br>| heve not had duty in Vashington, policy letters and other important Jocae~<br>ments sigaed by the Secretary of the Nevy or by the Chie? of Naval<br>Qperations sre not prepared by then, but by the particular individual who.<br>wente the Job done. It de he who must fight the policy letter through .<br>tho various layers and levels before 4t reaches the Chief of Level .</p>
<p>| Cnerations or the Seeretory of the Mary,</p>
<p>fhig requires tenacity and considersble patience, becouse the Navy</p>
<p>Zopertmont te like an autonobile with elx indtytdnal brakes; the car cannot<br>start until oll six passengers agree to release their breke. Many individuals<br>in a large orgenisation have the power to cay &quot;Ho¥ = and many orofects are<br>stouved because the originator nects discourasenent after Giscournasenent ond<br>finslly saye “vhat the hell&quot;, or else is transferred to other duty. .</p>
<p>Therefore, one nust Lave a seleable 4ten which Appeals to a larze group<br>of ngople « preferably to thore in responsible positione, 4g a rule, the<br>“hd. dher paople ara in an orsont za tion, the more receptive they are to new. .<br>idens, and the problem is how to get to thege high people, This requiras<br>| a thoroush knovledse of the organiantion, of the mental attitude of those<br>who misht eporove and of thosa who nicht disesnrove. There ere many who<br>will disapprove. They ars like onlookers. in a struzele in which they have<br>not vergonal stake. They are aden’ at the etiquettes of orsint zations,</p>
<p>Dat nt thout experience in doing things. They must be by-passed,</p>
<p>In Shia procesd of obtaining the ‘Hinting License*, as well as obteine<br>ing npproval of any other important idea, the method of presentation 1s<br>imortant. If you have a proposal with five pointe, for exemple, don&#x27;t<br>. trv to call all five at one time. Likewise don&#x27;t try to sell 5 points</p>
<p>sinulteneously to a group of 5 people. If one of the § objects to one of<br>the moposdle, he will: vote against your entire vacknse. . If three of<br>the &amp; gach object to one of the proposnle, then your whole packaze is<br>dest, Sut if you only present one proposal at a time, you cnn atend to<br>heve two people vote againat you, snd still win out.</p>
<p>e6a</p>
<p>It 4s also well to renember that mony important veople fail to become</p>
<p>rserested in various projects, not because they lack interest, but because</p>
<p>‘they lack tine. Therefore, you must so plan that your own project receives<br>the sttontion of these veoyla,</p>
<p>Having obtained the “Iunting License” you must set about imolenenting</p>
<p>4%. &quot;Hunting Licenses&quot; are not too difficult to obtain. The possession of</p>
<p>&amp; license is no fuasrentee of success. Thare are generally more hunting<br>. icennes iseued than there are deer to be hunted. Only the persistent hunter<br>ever gete aceer. First the honter must get a sun; this 4a vulearly mown<br>an governnent as *monsy&quot; « end without money nothing but good will can he<br>. obtained.<br>| it takes considerable thoucht, work, and time to obtain the funds<br>necessary to carry on 2 large nroject. But since nothing can be done withe _<br>out money, this necessarily takes sriority over all other matters, In the . ;<br>Defense Zatadlishment there are about § offices we must eo throuch before |<br>* tha ‘ease is presented to ths Bureau of the Budget. And any one of these<br>. ‘omn deny the funds or decrense the anount. .<br>In the ATC It is much less difficult. The case is presented to the<br>five Consissioners, and, if they approve, 1+ coss directly to the Bursau<br>of the Budvet. |<br>It 4s extrenely fortunats that in the early years of cur project we<br>were finenced almost entirely by the A&quot;C. To have hed te go throuch the<br>avy procedure in thoss deve, and to convince the many people who possessed</p>
<p>veto power = might have resulted in considerable delay in getting started. .</p>
<p>in the besinning wa obtained nearly all of our funds from the AZC,</p>
<p>o7e</p>
<p>Gradunily the Novy sertian ‘ian heen ineronsing, until now the AUC supplies<br>‘. about 75° of the resonrch snd development fonds, and tha Kevy avout at.<br>| the ability to draw on funds from two distinct agencies is a very valuable<br>one. shen the rules of one do not nernit certain work to be done, the rules<br>of the other generally do.<br>) ‘ihe ARG, by law, controls all atonic energy work: no one, including the<br>| &quot;avy, can ennace in this work unlass authorized by the AZO. It hecame<br>abviows to me from the first, that if we wore to olay an active and simmifie<br>cant role in developing navel atomic propulelon vlants, we had to beeane . z<br>estsdlished 2s an integral part of the AEG. After about one year of nolitike |<br>ing I wae finally ordered to duty in the AEC as Chief of the Haval Rexctors<br>Branch, Abt the eane time I was assigned additional duty es Head of the<br>Nuclear Power Division of the Surenu of Ships, Thus, one nerson, one sroun<br>of seovle, aeved for both the ARC and the Navy. Sy being nart of the ALC ve<br>achieved a powerful position to assist in formulating volicy and in obtaining<br>monoy. We have offiecss in the ARC and in the Wavy.
