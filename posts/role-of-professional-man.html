      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s 1959 address, delivered at the 90th anniversary of Roosevelt Hospital, issues a stark warning about America&#x27;s technological standing. Titled &quot;The Role of the Professional Man,&quot; the speech argues that US administrative interference and an overemphasis on egalitarianism are stifling professional independence and innovation, turning experts into mere technicians. Rickover draws a pointed historical parallel to 19th-century England&#x27;s decline relative to Germany due to its undervaluing of intellect and education (citing Mathew Arnold and John Erskine), asserting that the US now faces a similar challenge from the Soviet Union. He presents striking figures, noting that by 1957, the USSR had significantly more scientific and technical professionals, with higher growth rates and advanced degrees, contributing to faster &quot;lead times&quot; in development (2.5 years for Russia vs. 5-10 for the US). Rickover implores the medical profession, whom he praises for their autonomy and societal respect, to use their influence to advocate for the proper role and independence of *all* professionals, emphasizing &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; as crucial for national security and progress.</p>

        <p>Remarks prepared by VADM H. G. Rickover, USN, Assistant Director for Naval Reactors, Division of Reactor Development, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships for Nuclear Propulsion, Navy Department, for delivery at dinner commemorating the 90th anniversary of the founding of Roosevelt Hospital, New York, New York, October 29, 1959.</p>
<p>I consider it a signal honor that you asked me to be present at this celebration of the 90th anniversary of Roosevelt Hospital. I lack the close ties that bind most of you to this splendid hospital but I share your pride in its achievements and your hopes for its future. It gives me great pleasure to speak on this festive occasion.</p>
<p>Whether what I say will also give you pleasure is problematical. I hope you did not expect of me the kind of eulogy which is customary at birthday parties. I am not good at eulogies; my forte is to bring to light unpleasant facts that show we must do better in this or that field; to harangue people who are perfectly content with the status quo, in the hope they will bestir themselves and bring about reforms. Tonight I find myself in the situation--unusual for me--of facing an audience consisting largely of people who support, manage, or work in an institution which has my wholehearted approval. I can find no unpleasant facts about this particular hospital, about hospitals in general, or about the medical profession. I have only gratitude for the good that medical people and hospitals do.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have long had what I may term a &quot;professional&quot; admiration for physicians. I am grateful that in their hands medical science is put solely to beneficial use--the only science I know from which are removed the harmful potentialities inherent in all knowledge that gives power over man or nature.</p>
<p>I envy the role your profession has won for itself in our society, and its high standards in education and professional conduct. I see a close connection between medical ethics and the physician's professional independence. Without the doctor's assumption of complete responsibility for his cases--without his insistence that he alone must judge how best to serve them--the patients' welfare would cease to be paramount in medical service. Nor would doctors be as successful in putting medical science to practical use if, in performing their work, they had to submit to lay interference. Because a doctor will never submit to orders from a layman on how to diagnose or treat disease, he retains his professional standing, even when he becomes part of an organization--be it a professional institution, such as a hospital, or one not solely devoted to medicine, such as industrial or governmental bureaucracies.</p>
<p>In short, what I envy is the medical profession's understanding of the proper role of the professional man and its success in winning public recognition of this role for physicians. Most other professions neither understand, nor convince the public, that their role should not be inferior to that of the physician. The theme of my remarks is that in this age of science and technology, we depend on our professional people to an extent unknown in the past. Unless the public comprehends the nature of the professional man's contributions to private comfort and national security, and accords a proper role to all professions, we shall lag in the technological race which the Russians have forced upon us.</p>
<p>I do not claim that the role of the professional in a nation is the sole determinant of its technological progress. Ability and willingness to give adequate financial support to those who advance and utilize science is another important determinant. Readiness to sacrifice personal to national interest is still another. But tonight I shall concentrate on the role of the professional man. Let me start by defining what a professional man is and does:</p>
<p>He is a person who has acquired mastery of a particular branch of systematized knowledge--an academic discipline--as well as a technique for applying this specialized knowledge to the problems of everyday life. Many professionals do no more than this; others, who are creatively endowed, advance their particular branch of science and devise new ways to put it to practical use. The professional man's contribution to society is his use of a good mind and specialized knowledge for solution of problems that cannot be solved by the common sense of ordinary men.</p>
<p>Life never follows routines. The problems to which professional men apply their special talents are often novel, requiring that they possess judgment and ability to use basic principles in new ways. To be a professional person, a man must therefore not merely have a good mind and specialized knowledge but he must also be able to deal with new situations--otherwise he is merely a technician.</p>
<p>Technicians can perform highly specialized and difficult work, but they do it in a routine way. A technician is not equipped to deal with novel problems; a professional man is. Whoever can do no more than routine work does not deserve to be called a professional man.</p>
<p>Professional men have in common with technicians a fund of specialized knowledge not possessed by ordinary laymen; they differ from technicians in their ability to use this knowledge in nonroutine--in new--ways; they alone move technology forward. This is today poorly understood in our country. In consequence, our professional people cannot give of their best. When we subject them to administrative interference and force them to conform to organizational routines, we turn professional men into technicians; we then obtain from them no more than what technicians are able to give. We badly need to understand the role of all professions, as we now understand the role of the medical profession.</p>
<p>The public recognizes that the physician must independently judge how best to perform his work because it sees the necessity of this independence. It sees the necessity because everyone realizes that the physician, in his field of knowledge is vastly superior to every layman. The public does not fully recognize that other professionals in their own field of knowledge are equally superior to laymen. It is supremely important that the American people comprehend that technicians will not win us the technological race; nor will administrators, public relations men or other non-professional people.</p>
<p>We must understand that the professional is the key man in the advancement and utilization of science. Without him, science would be a closed book; technology would be limited to such techniques as could be discovered by empirical means, aided by the insight of an occasional self-educated genius. Without the professions, man's ability to put nature to work is severely limited and life remains static. But we know from experience that any country can rapidly appropriate the science and technology already achieved by the most advanced nations. All it takes is determination to do so. Levels of technology therefore tend to even out as one country after another adopts modern techniques. The initial advantage possessed by nations who invent science and technology is not retained unless these nations stay ahead of the rest in technological efficiency. Their head start is easily lost, chiefly, because it breeds in people a sense of superiority which leads to complacency and slackening of effort. England, for example, lost her head start as the first country to introduce industrialization because she proved less efficient in advancing and utilizing science than her Continental competitors. These were willing to put in more effort to be technologically efficient and they understood better what this effort must be.</p>
<p>Modern science and technology were invented by the West and all Western nations have made important contributions. But not all have at all times understood the importance of the professions, nor have they at all times recognized that technological progress depends on public support of education and scientific research. The key role of the professions, in particular, is better understood by some countries than by others. A hundred years ago it was better understood on the European Continent than in England; today it is better understood by other Western peoples than by Americans. It is also better understood in the Soviet Union than in the United States.</p>
<p>Because a profession is intellectual in content (though practical in application), national attitudes toward intelligence and education influence the place of the professions in a nation's scale of values. John Erskine once wrote a piece called &quot;The Moral Obligation to be Intelligent,&quot; in which he raised this question: In the &quot;reckoning up of our spiritual goods...&quot;, in the &quot;list of our genuine admirations, will intelligence be one of them?&quot; His answer was that in Anglo-Saxon countries it is not; these countries have long been disposed &quot;to consider intelligence a peril.&quot; For different reasons, England and the United States value other human qualities more highly than intellect. In modern life this is dangerous because the science and technology upon which we must count to make life on this crowded planet dignified and comfortable depends upon men of superior intellect and education. Let me go back a hundred years to make my point.</p>
<p>The principal reason why Germany rapidly closed the gap in industrial productivity between herself and England was Germany's better understanding that a country's industrial--and hence political--position in the world depends on ability to increase and utilize scientific knowledge. She drew the correct inference that education must therefore be made widely available; that private initiative is insufficient and schools and universities must be, at least in part, supported out of taxes. She further recognized the key role of the professions. By offering them generous rewards, she insured that men of first-rate ability were drawn into the professions.</p>
<p>In education, England was then many years behind Germany and several other Continental nations. It is instructive to browse through the voluminous literature on the great educational debate which agitated public life in England during most of the 19th century. Although German manufactured products were inching into England's monopolistic control of world markets, and German military might was growing, the advocates of better education had rough sledding, for England was still the richest land on earth and Englishmen could not easily be aroused. &quot;Never did people believe anything more firmly,&quot; wrote Mathew Arnold, &quot;than nine Englishmen out of ten at the present day believe that our greatness and welfare are proved by our being so very rich.&quot; Trevelyan comments that &quot;in a world so comfortable and prosperous, it was difficult for any set of men to feel grievances very acutely.&quot;</p>
<p>Educational chauvinism comes naturally to prosperous and powerful nations. They are annoyed when told they can learn from less prosperous or powerful nations. When Prince Albert joined the advocates of educational reform, there was a feeling that, as Trevelyan puts it, the Prince spoke as he did because he was, after all, a German and &quot;popular education was a fad--fit perhaps for industrious foreigners in Central Europe who had not our other advantages of character and world-position.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany was as far ahead of England in recognizing the value of the professions as she was in education and in support of science and research. Here too Arnold's voice was raised in warning. On the Continent, and especially in Germany, the professions were &quot;the stronghold of science and systematic knowledge,&quot; he wrote, while in England they were not. Only a few of England's leaders saw how dangerous to the nation was this undervaluation of intelligence and education. Their haranguing and warnings eventually prodded England into setting up a state system of education and into giving recognition to her men of superior intellect and knowledge. For their efforts on behalf of reform, these men were often accused of disloyalty and of being in love with Germany! Their voice brought a discordant note into the Victorian symphony of self-congratulation and complacency. Indeed their criticism was sometimes scathing for they felt deeply that the nation's future was at stake.</p>
<p>Typical of their courage and the despair they must often have felt was an editorial in the magazine Nature, published on the occasion of the Queen's Jubilee in 1887. What seems to have induced the editor to break into the universal atmosphere of self-satisfied rejoicing, with a solemn warning against continued English disrespect of intellect, was his exasperation when only one Fellow of the Royal Institute was invited to the ceremony at Westminster. A theatrical entertainer, he wrote bitterly, might be admitted to the presence of the Queen, but a Darwin, Stokes or Huxley would not. &quot;The brains of the nation is divorced from its head.&quot; Abroad, he remarked pointedly, these matters were differently ordered; there men of letters, art, and science were made welcome in the councils of the sovereign.</p>
