      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s 1968 speech, &quot;Who Protects the Public?&quot;, delivered at the 50th Materials Engineering Congress, critically examines the inherent deficiencies of voluntary industry safety codes in safeguarding public health and well-being from technological hazards. Rickover argues that allowing manufacturers to set their own standards—as exemplified by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code—creates an unacceptable conflict of interest, leading to minimum requirements, insufficient independent inspection, and a false sense of security. He illustrates these failures with specific cases, including defective welds, a heat exchanger support failure costing over $500,000 in repairs, and cracked piping. Drawing parallels to the inadequacy of 1935 natural gas pipeline standards that necessitated government intervention (and citing the 1954 Atomic Energy Act as a better model), Rickover advocates for fundamental changes. His recommendations include mandatory independent design review and inspection, formal reporting and investigation of all failures, stringent qualification requirements for all personnel, and clear governmental oversight at all levels to establish and enforce robust safety codes, emphasizing that relying on self-policing by industry is &quot;naive.&quot;</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>hy</p>
<p>I welcome the opportunity of addressing this Materials Engineering<br>Congress. You may remember that six years ago I spoke to you of &quot;The<br>Never-Ending Challenge.&quot; By that I meant the need for industry to keep<br>on improving the quality of workmanship and the standards for inspection<br>of its products in order to meet the continually rising requirements set<br>by teohuclogy. We keep developing new technologies. Each new<br>development calls for new levels of performance; there is no letup.</p>
<p>Some progress has been made in the past six years but much more needs<br>to be done. ;</p>
<p>Today I want to examine a related fundamental problem. It has to<br>do with finding reliable means to prevent the private use of technology<br>from doing injury to public health and well-being. I use this term in<br>the broadest sense, including not only human life and health, but also<br>natural resources, vital services, the whole of the environment<br>enveloping man and society. Almost every new technology represents a</p>
<p>potential hazard to these human values; the more advanced it is, the more</p>
<p>OOTH2..</p>
<p>various and deadly are its adverse effects likely to be unless there are<br>adequate safeguards. These safeguards tne public cannot itself provide;<br>they must be the responsibility of those who control development and<br>application of technology. Many pelieve that 4ndustry safety codes for<br>equipment provide these safeguards. I submit that these codes, as<br>currently developed and applied, do not fully meet this responsibility.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of any safety code depends largely on who sets it<br>and who enforces it. As now constituted, industry codes have a puilt-in<br>weakness, for they are prepared and controlled on @ yoluntary basis by<br>the very people to whom they are to be applied; the analogy would be if<br>the judge and the judged were the same. All of man&#x27;s experience shows<br>that self-policing does not give the public adequate protection. It<br>does not even ensure safe use of ordinary consumer goods--foods, Grugs »<br>automobiles, etc. The purchaser has no practical way of judging them.<br>The situation is not essentially different, though far more complicated<br>in cases where the public buys @ service, yet has no control over the<br>equipment used to provide that service; where the individual is merely<br>a passive recipient, as for example, in the transportation or utility<br>4ndustries. A complicating Factor here is the widespread misconception<br>of the roles and responsibilities of the parties who buy, make, inspect;<br>and operate the equipment.</p>
<p>I am sure you are aware that the typical industry code is formulated<br>by 4 committee elected or appointed by a technical society or similar<br>group. Members are drawn primarily from the manufacturers to whom the</p>
<p>code is to be applied. Near unanimous agreement in the committee must</p>
<p>be obtained to set requirements or to change them. The code, which is<br>then widely accepted and applied, represents a minimum level of<br>requirements that is acceptable to the industry as_3 whole. What has</p>
<p>happened--to put it bluntly--is that those directly involved _in</p>
<p>manufacturing 4 roduct are the ve ones who set eode re uirements.</p>
<p>The technical society and its code committees, at pest, merely ensure</p>
<p>that the requirements are uniform throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Let me now deseribe some of the deficiencies of industry safety</p>
<p>codes and of the way in which they are used in the design, manufacture »<br>inspection and operation of equipment where safe and reliable operation<br>is essential to public well-being. I will then submit recommendations</p>
<p>for an alternative approach to setting and enforcing safety codes, ene<br>that seeks to take a4nto account the proper role of each party involved.<br>Tnadequacies of voluntary safety codes are not unique to any<br>particular industry or type of product. To focus my discussion, I have<br>selected a number of examples 4llustrating this problem in areas with<br>which I am familiar. These examples range from problems associated with</p>
<p>experimental facilities to those related to the construction of complex</p>
<p>power plants.<br>Because of my packground in nuclear power plants, I feel it</p>
<p>necessary to make 4¢ plain that what I am talking about today is the</p>
<p>manner in which 4ndustry safety codes are developed and applied. I do</p>
<p>not wish my remarks to infer that nuclear power plants are unsafe. In<br>applications of atomic power, the Government has provided a regulatory<br>As a result of this supervision</p>
<p>agency to protect the public interest.</p>
<p>by the Government, the hazard to the public from these nuclear power<br>Plants has been minimized. One way this has peen achieved is through<br>she use of safeguards which do not merely depend on industry codes.</p>
<p>Before citing cases, I should make two more points that are<br>important to a clear understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>Safety codes must not be confused with product standards, whose<br>purpose is uniformity and interchangeability among similar products.</p>
<p>To make this distinction clear, I will use the term &quot;codes&quot; --and not</p>
<p>&quot; standards&quot; --when I refer to requirements for assuring safe design,<br>manufacture, and operation of equipment. There are many aspects of<br>design and manufacture which affect safety, including engineering and<br>fabrication standards. Safety codes must cover all such requirements.</p>
<p>Minimizing cost should not be an overriding factor in setting safety<br>codes. That industry must make a reasonable profit is a basic tenet of<br>our free enterprise system. But public well-being requires that adequate<br>safety codes be established. The contractual arrangements for specifying<br>and making products which meet these requirements and for determining<br>the legal responsibilities between the parties ean then properly remain<br>a matter between buyer and seller.</p>
<p>I will use a recent experience involving the American Society for<br>Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code 48 an<br>example to illustrate two serious problems in applying industry codes.<br>The ASME Code is widely applied and is generally considered to be one</p>
<p>of the better industry codes.</p>
<p>The problems are, first, that the Code does not require the</p>
<p>manufacturer to deliver a roduct free of unacce table defects; and,</p>
<p>second, that the supposedly independent code inspector does not</p>
<p>adequately represent the buyer&#x27;s and the public&#x27;s interests.<br>Recently, during fabrication of a pressure vessel in accordance with</p>
<p>the ASME Code, the manufacturer radiographed one of the major structural</p>
<p>welds and found several defects which required repair. In order to</p>
<p>locate the defects accurately and thus facilitate repairs, the<br>manufacturer, using ultrasonic techniques, made an additional examination<br>! of the weld. This examination, which is not required by the Code,</p>
<p>revealed that numerous other defects might be present. The buyer, when</p>
<p>notified by the manufacturer of these possible additional defects,</p>
<p>considered them to be sufficiently significant in number and size to</p>
<p>raise serious questions about the integrity of the weld. The<br>| 2 manufacturer, however, took the position that the Code does not require</p>
<p>| | repair of defects unless they are discovered by the specific inspection</p>
<p>| techniques laid down in the Code. The manufacturer, therefore, repaired</p>
<p>only the defects revealed by the inspections specified by the Code. He<br>then presented the weld to the ASME Code inspector, who accepted it.<br>The Code inspection service in this case was provided by an insurance<br>company hired by the manufacturer in accordance with practices outlined<br>in the Code. These practices are accepted by most of our states, and<br>have been incorporated into their laws.</p>
<p>The buyer repeatedly protested that the evidence produced by the</p>
<p>manufacturer himself showed that the weld was suspect. These protests</p>
<p>were met by the manufacturer and the insurance company with the</p>
<p>assertion that the weld met all Code requirements. Thus the Code was</p>
<p>4m effect being used as an escape from the broad obligations that the<br>product must have adequate structural integrity for its specified<br>service conditions. In essence, what the manufacturer and the insurance<br>company were saying was that it is proper to ignore pertinent and<br>available information which casts doubt on the integrity of a product;<br>and that despite this doubt the product may be certified as meeting<br>Code requirements. The plain fact thus is that the Code requires only<br>that a product meet the specified inspection requirements, not that it<br>be free of unacceptable defects.</p>
<p>As for the insurance company, which is widely considered to be an<br>independent code inspection agency, it acted in this case as though it<br>were an agent of the manufacturer. To be specific, the insurance company<br>would not take part in technical discussions of the pressure vessel&#x27;s<br>integrity with the buyer unless requested to do so by the manufacturer.<br>The manufacturer refused to make such a request.</p>
<p>I should point out that this example of code application was not<br>one involving only a single small manufacturer. The manufacturer in this<br>case was wholly owned by an industry leader in the design and manufacture<br>of equipment for power generating stations. During contract negotiations<br>for the vessel in question, the parent company stated that it would use<br>its technical and financial resourtes to assist the manufacturer to<br>carry out properly his obligations under the contract. But, when this</p>
<p>serious question of product integrity arose, the management of the</p>
<p>parent company would provide no real assistance. They merely said they</p>
<p>uere prepared to assist their subsidiary and had assisted him on request.</p>
<p>Gut they would take no position on the technical adequacy of the weld in</p>
<p>qpaestion. In fact, they said they did not understand the buyer&#x27;s<br>4nsistence that they evaluate the suitability or acceptability of the</p>
<p>hey had not assumed any of their</p>
<p>weld. They also declared that t<br>hey said that their subsidiary</p>
<p>subsidiary&#x27;s obligations. In conclusion, t</p>
<p>s that the weld in question does meet the ASME Code.&quot;</p>
<p>“has advised u</p>
<p>In sum, the parent company also accepted no responsibility for the</p>
<p>quality of the product peyond their narrow interpretation of Code</p>
<p>requirements.</p>
<p>to understand why the parties concerned took this</p>
<p>I have tried<br>e that the Code as written was interpreted</p>
<p>position. It seems clear to m</p>
<p>poth by the manufacturer and by the insurance company to provide a</p>
<p>well-defined limited liability for the manufacturer. As the case shows,</p>
<p>this interpretation might have compromised safety had not a compe</p>
<p>alert buyer taken steps on his own and at his own expense to ensure the<br>ect both his own and</p>
<p>tent and</p>
<p>level of quality and integrity necessary to prot</p>
<p>the public&#x27;s interest.</p>
<p>To determine whether the position taken by the manufacturer and the</p>
<p>insurance company had the endorsement of the ASME Committee which is</p>
<p>responsible for developing and interpreting this Code, the buyer asked</p>
<p>the Committee a simple question:</p>
<p>&quot;te a component or part of a component (such as a weld) meets all</p>
<p>of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code requirements,</p>
<p>but is known as a result of</p>
<p>4ncluding those for inspection,</p>
<p>other supplemental inspection procedures to contain defects,</p>
<p>must this additional information be evaluated in judging</p>
<p>whether the component meets the Code?&quot;</p>
<p>The reply of the ASME Committee was unfortunately couched in the<br>diplomatic language typical of pureaucratic caution. It contained the<br>2ollowing statements which contradict each other.</p>
<p>Here is the first: &quot;If the inspector were aware of a harmful defect<br>which was not disclosed by the Code examination but which did affect the<br>safety of the vessel, he would have a moral responsibility to consider<br>this information before certifying the vessel.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is the second: &quot;Decisions based on such supplementary<br>examinations are not Code matters and must be resolved by agreement<br>pereen the manufacturer and the purchaser.&quot;</p>
<p>From this I conclude that morality requires that all available</p>
<p>inspection results be considered, put the Code does not.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the refusal of the Code inspection agency to<br>meet with the buyer unless so requested by the manufacturer, it was ©<br>recommended that the ASME make it a Code requirement that inspection and<br>certification be carried out by an organization independent of the<br>manufacturer whose product is peing inspected. The ASME Committee&#x27;s<br>answer was that in their view present practice already complies with<br>this recommendation. They said that while the inspector&#x27;s employer is<br>paid by the manufacturer, this does not place either the inspector or his</p>
<p>employer under the direction of the manufacturer, in the usual</p>
<p>contractual sense. The ASME Committee did not, however, discuss or</p>
<p>explain wy the inspection agency, supposedly not under the direction of<br>eme manufacturer, would not meet with the puyer unless requested to do</p>
<p>3 by the manufacturer. I find myself completely at a loss how GO</p>
<p>Co]</p>
<p>Ls |</p>
<p>~oconeile their views with the facts.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to shed some light on this cloudy subject, 1 had<br>inquiries made of insurance companies providing Code inspection services<br>for vessels peing manufactured to Code requirements. The inquiries<br>sought to determine; first, whether the inspection agency actually<br>serves the puyer&#x27;s interest; second, what records 4t keeps of any<br>independent inspections made by its own inspectors; third, whether these<br>records are available to the buyer. My hope is that clarification of<br>these three points can pe used to determine what additional steps buyers<br>will have to take to fulfill their responsibilities to the public. I<br>urge other puyers to ask the same questions. Also, I urge them to take<br>account of the fact that in practice the insurance company&#x27;s Code<br>anspector generally checks only the manufacturer&#x27;s inspection records.</p>
<p>Further, it should be understood that the training requirements<br>d procedures used by 2 typical insurance company for upgrading its<br>inspectors after their 4nitial qualification are not available outside<br>the insurance company 4tself. Thus no one--neither the public, nor the<br>manufacturer, nor the buyer--can find out what actually is being done.<br>More important » 4t must be fully understood that the Code inspection<br>agency accepts no responsibility for adequacy of the product. The<br>manufacturer&#x27;s data report, which is the official inspection yecord he</p>
<p>makes available to the state or to the buyer, ineludes @ certificate of</p>
<p>fmapection signed by the code inspector.</p>
<p>But this &quot;certificate&quot; contains the following disclaimer:</p>
<p>&quot;By signing this certificate neither the inspector nor his</p>
<p>employer makes any warranty expressed or implieds concerning</p>
<p>the pressure vessel described in this manufacturer&#x27;s data</p>
<p>report. Furthermore » neither the inspector nor his employer</p>
<p>shall be liable in any manner for any personal injury or</p>
<p>property damage or a loss of any kind arising from or</p>
<p>connected with this inspection.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to this disclaimer, a typical contract under which an<br>4nsurance company provides Code inspection service requires the<br>manufacturer to andemnify the 4nsurance company against any liability.<br>Let me emphasize that the shortcomings I have been discussing do not<br>lie primarily in the technical content of this ASME Code 4tself; they are<br>4nherent in the system of setting and enforcing voluntary. standards.</p>
<p>This ASME Code is, in fact, ahead of some other codes in recognizing the<br>need for inspection by an agency other than the manufacturer - Many<br>other safety codes do not even require inspection by @ go-called<br>&quot;4sndependent&quot; agency</p>
<p>Another major shortcoming of present code practices 4s: The codes</p>
<p>up_adequate requirements for desta</p>
<p>areas important for assuring safety--areas that are often not obvious 5</p>
<p>and may therefore well be overlooked by an unwary purchaser. An example</p>
<p>do not _set</p>
<p>4s the need for an independent check of design work «</p>
<p>Several years ago there was a case which illustrates this need.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Wew heat exchangers were to be installed in a central station power<br>plant. An architect-engineer was hired to evaluate adequacy of the’<br>existing support structure which was to be reused, and to design<br>aaditionai new support structures. During 4nitial filling of the heat<br>exehangers, @ failure of one of the steel support structures was<br>discovered quite by accident. Had this failure not been discovered at<br>that time it is likely the support would have proken during subsequent<br>operation, with consequences that could have peen serious.</p>
<p>Detailed investigation of this failure revealed several gignificant<br>facts. For example, the original design of the support that had failed,<br>and of several other supports was found to have been inadequate. These<br>- supports did not meet the American Institute for Steel Construction Code.<br>Moreover, the architect-engineer responsible for the redesign work had<br>apparently not checked the design of the original supports although his<br>contract required him to do SO. ‘Then too, it was found that some of<br>the new structures which he had designed did not meet this construction<br>Code. In addition, there was a lack of clear definition as to which<br>industry code applied to those parts where equipment and structures were<br>joined together. The architect-engineer chose to apply 4 less restrictive |<br>code than the one the buyer considered to be applicable under the |<br>contract.</p>
<p>As a result of this investigation and subsequent action by the<br>Government, the architect-engineer and his insurance company paid over<br>half a million dollars for additional engineering and construction costs</p>
<p>ineurred in correcting the faulty design work. This shows that 4</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>@eeiemer--in this case the ayohd berk~enzineer—nie liable if he fails<br>So Go his job properly, much as a manufacturer is liable for a<br>@efective product.</p>
<p>What this proves is that an independent design review is essential.</p>
<p>Desigers are just as fallible as anyone else. Some codes have taken</p>
<p>halfway steps by requiring the design to be certified by a professional |<br>emzineer. But these steps do not fully meet the problem, since they |<br>specifically allow the professional engineer to be an employee of the<br>organization doing the design work. Here again we have a fundamental<br>weakmess of present code practice; the design engineer may review and<br>eertify his own work.</p>
<p>Another example illustrates that the codes are not kept sufficiently<br>up-to-date on inspection methods.</p>
<p>This case involved the parehase of welded piping for the main</p>
<p>cooling water system in a large power plant. Subsequent to delivery of</p>
<p>some of the piping, the purchaser learned that the manufacturer had<br>discovered cracking in batches of additional piping being made for this<br>same order. Whereupon the purchaser subjected samples of the already<br>delivered pipe to destructive examination. He found cracks. This piping<br>had passed all inspections required by the applicable American Society<br>for Testing Materials specification, plus X-ray inspection prescribed in &gt;<br>the contract by the buyer. Additional tests and analyses conducted by<br>the purchaser established that the cracks--some of which were one-half<br>inch long--rendered the material unfit for the intended service. Here</p>
<p>was a clear-cut case where piping supplied and inspected by the</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>mea? acturer in accordance with industry requirements was in fact unfit<br>far use and nad to be replaced by the purchaser at his ows expense.</p>
<p>This and similar experiences notwithstanding, most piping codes<br>still do not require the use of such modern techniques as ultrasonic<br>fmspection which has been successfully used on many occasions and would,<br>im this particular instance, have undoubtedly shown up the presence of<br>sracks. An avoidable risk of failures in service due to undetected<br>@efects is still being accepted by the code committees, by manufacturers »<br>and purchasers.</p>
<p>“It is essential that as technology advances and products and systems</p>
<p>become more complex, the pest available inspection methods be incorporated</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>tn the codes. Code committees ought promptly and continually to be<br>specifying use of improved inspection methods. As they now stand, the<br>codes provide 1ittle 4neentive to develop and apply petter 4nspection<br>sechniques. This is perhaps not surprising given the fact that committee<br>members are generally drawn from manufacturers whose products are to be<br>inspected. Recently an ASME committee stated that use of a new |<br>anspection method cannot be required by their Code until the method is<br>capable of standardization. Since the inspections specified by the<br>eodes are, in practice, all that the manufacturer will normally carry<br>out ; development of new and improved inspection methods is pound to be<br>extremely slow. If no one applies a new technique unless it has pecome<br>standardized, inspection methods specified py the codes will always lag<br>technology &gt;» and the public will always be the loser. The difficulty</p>
<p>here is, of course; the consensus rule which prevents the code committee</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>@rqm keeping the codes abreast of new ways to protect the public.</p>
<p>So far I have spoken of specific problems encountered in applying<br>am@ustry codes. There are other deficiencies 4nherent in the present<br>aystem, to which I can only refer briefly. For example:</p>
<p>1. Important areas that directly affect safety are covered<br>only by so-called &quot;recommended&quot; or &quot;optional&quot; practices and not by<br>specific requirements » Are you aware that many industry codes do not<br>set up or require uniform methods for inspection, or even require |<br>qualification of the manufacturer&#x27;s own inspectors? Some codes, for<br>example the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, do require the<br>manufacturer&#x27;s inspection personnel to be qualified. But the extent of<br>qualification in this ASME Code 4s defined merely by &quot;necommended<br>practices&quot; issued py the Society for Nondestructive Testing. These<br>recommended practices state that they may be modified and adapted by<br>each manufacturer at his own discretion. Thus, even in this &quot;better&quot;<br>Code neither the Society for Nondestructive Testing, the Code committee,<br>nor the states 4nvoking this Code exercise any real control. Control is<br>left to the individual manufacturer.</p>
<p>2, Failure of products manufactured under industry codes<br>generally need not be reported to or investigated by an independent<br>central agency. Thus 5 4mportant lessons that could prevent future<br>failures are not disseminated among persons with a legitimate interest<br>in the matter. Great Britain has the edge on us here. Her laws require</p>
<p>that all boiler failures be reported to and 4nvestigated by an</p>

<p>held liable for t</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>eclationship--I question how long. technical societies and members of<br>their committees will be able to retain their present immunity .</p>
<p>The same question applies to the 4nsurance companies which provide<br>inspection services and certify that these eodes have been met,<br>regardless of any disclaimers they may make.</p>
<p>There obviously are parallel situations in other areas affecting<br>public health and well-being. In each of them there is initially little<br>recognition of the threat to the public. Some companies or municipalities<br>do, of course, take steps to provide protection; many do not. Then an<br>accident occurs that focuses public attention on the hazard. There may<br>be widespread damage--as by the sale of contaminated meat or harmful<br>drugs. Or a series of accidents may occur--such as airplane crashes.<br>This generally sparks discussion and proposals for government action.</p>
<p>To forestall intrusion of government, the 4ndustry concerned will usually<br>propose voluntary safety requirements. Depending as they do on industry<br>eonsensus, these requirements represent the minimum safety measures all<br>are willing to accept. This is not enough. There will be more accidents.<br>Only after the lapse of much time are laws finally enacted. Much harm<br>will have been done in the interval--harm which could have been<br>prevented.</p>
<p>Let me remind you of the dramatic natural gas pipeline story. ~AS”</p>
<p>you may know, industry standards governing gas pipeline construction<br>went into effect in 1935. They were not adequate. Many deaths and<br>injuries were sustained because of pipeline explosions. The public was</p>
<p>aroused; the matter came pefore Congress. The Congressional hearings on</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>this subject highlighted many deficiencies in this self-imposed<br>industry piping Code. For examples the Code was not mandatory; it<br>did not require checking the pipe once it was installed; 4t was not<br>adopted uniformly by the states; it had no provision for enforcement.<br>Further, it did not define welding inspection procedures; 4t merely<br>suggested inspection during yarious stages of construction; 4t did</p>
<p>not require retesting when a failure occurred during initial tests.</p>
<p>‘During testimony on this bill, 4 former chairman of the piping<br>Code Committee stated: &quot;standard specification committees tend to<br>pe dominated by the manufacturers.-ess This very often results in<br>the tolerances peing so proad that 4 user cannot be sure that the<br>material or equipment purchased under this specification is going</p>
<p>to pe suitable for nis specific use.&quot;</p>
<p>The recently enacted Federal law charges the Secretary of<br>transportation with responsibility to set_and enforce requirements<br>insuring safe transport of natural gas through interstate pipelines.<br>To assist him in developing these requirements» the law sets UP a,<br>committees composed of technically qualified members representing<br>Federal and state governments » the natural gas 4ndustry, a6 well as<br>the general public. In principle, this would seem to be the proper</p>
<p>approach for setting and enforcing safety codes.</p>
<p>This approach is consistent with that followed by the Atomic Energy</p>
<p>Commission. Written into the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is the mandate</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>shat the Commission shall carry out &quot;gevelopment and utilization of</p>
<p>imum extent consistent with..-+-</p>
<p>Atomic Energy to the max fealth and</p>
<p>safety of the public.&quot; The Commission through its Licensing process</p>
<p>has exercised a substantial amount of control over nuclear safety</p>
<p>matters, and the safety record has been good. Rapid expansion in the</p>
<p>number of commercial nuclear power plants will require that even greater</p>
<p>care be given to designing, puildings and operating them with maximum</p>
<p>safety and reliability. To this end, the Atomic Energy Commission 1s</p>
<p>cessary to develop and enforce supplementary</p>
<p>finding it 4nereasingly ne</p>
<p>safety requirements above and peyond industry codes for equipment such</p>
<p>as pressure vessels, heat exchangers, pumps, and valves. The Atomic</p>
<p>paid particular attention to the nuclear aspects</p>
<p>Energy Commission has<br>Equal attention must pe given by others to the</p>
<p>of these plants.<br>in order to avoid the kind of problems |</p>
<p>conventional parts of the plants</p>
<p>I nave described.<br>Other examples of government agencies using this approach will also</p>
<p>come to mind as you consider the fundamental problem I have described.</p>
<p>But I must repeat that all too often action is taken too late. Common</p>
<p>sense and history tell us that we must take steps to control potential</p>
<p>hazards before we have to pay 2 needlessly high price in harm to the</p>
<p>public.</p>
<p>As to the general question of how to provide necessary protection</p>
<p>for the public, T submit we must change our pasic approach. Above all,</p>
<p>and responsibility</p>
<p>we must clearly define and understand the proper role</p>
<p>of each of the parties 4nvolved--buyers » manufacturers » code committees,</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>government agencies, and the public.</p>
<p>1. The puyer--the immediate user of the equipment --should<br>actively engage in the development of the safety codes to make them more<br>effective in serving his needs and interests. But his responsibility<br>extends beyond mere participation in preparing codes and peyond the<br>setting of specifications in the contract. He must not rely on codes;<br>on the manufacturer working to code requirements, or on code inspectors.<br>He must recognize that codes do not of themselves relieve him of his<br>responsibility to protect the public, and of his liability if he does not.<br>This means that he must set specifications which clearly prescribe the<br>service conditions the equipment must meet, and he must specify whatever<br>level of quality and integrity is needed to achieve the required degree<br>of safety. He must then make certain that his specifications are met<br>by providing independent, competent surveillance of design, manufacture,<br>and inspection.</p>
<p>2, The mar manufacturer&#x27;s responsibility 4s to design and make @</p>
<p>roduct that is adequate for sts intended service, not just one that<br>meets minimum inspection requirements. In light of recent court<br>decisions regarding liability for product defects, manufacturers gnould,<br>for their own protection, and for the protection of the public, encourage<br>rather than resist the upgrading and strict enforcement of safety codes.</p>
<p>3. Technical societies and their code committees must continue<br>to play an important --though a sontrabutory--role in developing safety<br>codes. ‘The technical competence and experience of their members 4s needed</p>
<p>to develop practical, usable codes and to provide improved design methods</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>and sinspection sechniques- However » these 4ndustry groups should<br>recognize that by sheir very nature» ney cannot and should not control<br>establishment and enforcement of safety codes. Tn this connections At<br>is snteresting to note shat, in 2 recent speech, a past chairman of the<br>ASME Boiler and. Pressure vessel Committe gaid, in effect, shat yoluntary<br>codes will never pe fully effective. He suggested that 4ndustry<br>committees continue tO control preparation of these codes put predicted<br>shat government will take over their enforcement - This suggestion would<br>be an improvement » put I do not pelieve 4% goes far enough. What is<br>needed are code committees patterned after the one set up by Congress<br>for the natural gas pipeline 4ndustry</p>
<p>Opviously » what I am proposing 4nvolves pasic changes an the<br>way we get and enforce safety codes. But naving yead 4 Little nistory<br>and naving dealt with many humans » T know that changes will not occur<br>overnight - Present code committees must snerefore yndaertake » as an<br>urgent cask» correction of some of the pasic geficiencies TL nave<br>deserived 4oday « As a minimum, they ghould promptly effect four pasic<br>changes:</p>
<p>(a) Product quality should be defined in serms of unacceptable<br>defects, regardless of now chey are found.</p>
<p>(») Truly anaependent design peview and product anspection<br>must be required.</p>
<p>(c) All failures gnould be formally reported, snaependently<br>snvestigated, and the pesults widely disseminated.</p>
<p>(a) Finally &gt;» yniform and stringent qualification requirements</p>
<p>ae</p>
<p>ee .</p>
<p>should be specified for both manufacturer&#x27;s inspection personnel and<br>for independent code inspectors.</p>
<p>4, The responsibility of government agencies at local, state,<br>and Federal levels is to require puyers and manufacturers to meet their<br>own particular responsibilities. It must be recognized that no private<br>organization can completely and objectively represent the public interest.<br>Government agencies--whose responsibility is to the public--must see to<br>it that adequate safety codes are established and enforced. The<br>government agencies concerned must continue to obtain and consider the<br>assistance of industry in preparing these codes--but they must not<br>continue to permit industry to control them.</p>
<p>5. The responsibility of the ultimate user--the public--1s to<br>recognize the need for protection in our increasingly complex technical<br>society and to demand of their government that it be met.</p>
<p>I realize that my recommendations appear to be directly opposed to<br>the belief of some that the less government control the better; that<br>somehow American industry will rise above its own interests and<br>altruistically give overriding consideration to public health and<br>well-being. This is a naive idea, as has been proven time and again.</p>
<p>No person or group can pe depended on to police itself. No man can<br>serve two masters: his own 4nterest and the interest of the public.<br>Men should not be placed in a position where they have to reconcile the<br>two. It is the function of government to do so.</p>
<p>To protect man and his environment against damage from the technology</p>
<p>he. himself creates is perhaps the most important problem facing modern<br>society. You and I should consider it our personal responsibility to</p>
<p>contribute whatever we can to the solution.</p>
