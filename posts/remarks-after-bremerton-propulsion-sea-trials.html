      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This memo from December 1, 1980, details Admiral Rickover&#x27;s post-sea trial remarks for the Bremerton propulsion plant, emphasizing the paramount importance of quality and proper construction in submarines. Rickover asserts that &quot;first-class quality&quot; must always be the &quot;prime consideration,&quot; overriding concerns for lower cost or speedy construction, a principle he highlights by citing historical company orders from Electric Boat Company presidents L.Y. Spear (1945) and J.W. Jones (1965). He expresses concern that modern shipbuilding conglomerates often prioritize profit over quality, warning that &quot;transient management&quot; may lead to &quot;the loss of a submarine.&quot; The Admiral concludes by underscoring the intrinsic value of quality and integrity, referencing Matthew 6:21 (&quot;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also&quot;) and sharing an anecdote about the difficulty two &quot;experts&quot; had in locating this particular Bible verse.</p>

<p>26, 1945, mr. Spear issued electric boat company order no. 13. This order was a restatement of company policy published as order no. 4 dated september 1, 1932. It was published by the new london ship and engine works. On november 17, 1965, another former electric boat president, mr. J.W. jones, reissued mr. Spear's order to electric boat employees. The order included the following instructions:</p>
<p>&quot;First-class quality not only with respect to material and workmanship but also as to details of design is to be regarded always as the prime consideration not to be sacrificed in the interest of lower cost or of more speedy construction except when the latter is especially authorizied by the bureau.&quot;</p>
<p>Shipbuilding in the united states is now controlled by large conglomerates. In some cases the conglomerate's primary interest appears to be only to make money - regardless of what they are making, toys or naval ships.</p>
