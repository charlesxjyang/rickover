      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1977 speech, Admiral H. G. Rickover explores &quot;man&#x27;s purpose in life,&quot; beginning with Voltaire&#x27;s assertion that &quot;not to be occupied and not to exist are one and the same thing.&quot; He outlines several core principles for finding meaning: **responsibility**, which involves active participation and a commitment to &quot;rescue the world&quot; (as Confucius taught); **perseverance**, advocating continued effort even when facing a &quot;deaf world&quot;; **excellence**, emphasizing personal satisfaction and contrasting it with mediocrity, citing the Japanese &quot;National Human Treasure&quot; tradition; **creativity**, as the deepest joy in overcoming conventional opinion; **courage**, drawing on Sir Thomas More&#x27;s view of striving to guide policy; and **intellectual growth**, crucial for expanding one&#x27;s capacities, with reading (as per Norman Cousins) being a key method. Rickover highlights the declining state of morals, echoing Louis Brandeis&#x27;s insistence that &quot;fundamentals do not change,&quot; and concludes that &quot;the great end of life is not knowledge but action,&quot; aligning with Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; philosophy and likening the individual&#x27;s duty to posterity to Atlas&#x27;s burden.</p>

        <p>FOR RELEASE 12:45 P.M, (PST)<br>THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1977</p>
<p>THOUGHTS ON MAN&#x27;S PURPOSE IN LIFE<br>Admiral H. G. Rictover, U. S. Navy<br>at a Luncheon Meeting of the<br>San Diego Rotary Club<br>San Diego, California ;<br>Thursday, February 10, 1977</p>
<p>Voltaire once said: &#x27;&#x27;Not to be occupied and not to exist are one<br>and the same thing for a man.&quot;&#x27; With those few words he captured the<br>essence of a purpose in life: to work, to create, to excel, and to be<br>concerned about the world and its affairs.</p>
<p>The question of what we can do to give purpose or meaning to our<br>lives has been debated for thousands of years by philosophers and common<br>men, Yet today we seem, if anything, further from the answer than<br>before, Despite our great material wealth and high standard of living,<br>people are groping for something that money cannot buy. As Walter<br>Lippman put it in 1960: &quot;Our life, though it is full of things, is empty<br>of the kind of purpose and effort that gives to life its flavor and meaning, &quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>I do not claim to have a magic answer. But I believe there are<br>some basic principles of existence, propounded by thinkers through<br>the ages, which can guide us toward the goal of finding a purpose in<br>life,</p>
<p>Copyright ©1977, H. G. Rickover</p>

<p>Among these principles of existence, responsibility is the one</p>
<p>which forces man to become involved. Acceptance of responsibility<br>means that the individual takes upon himself an obligation. Responsi-<br>bility is broad and continuous. None of us are ever free of it, even<br>if our work is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Responsibility implies a commitment to self which many are not<br>willing to make; they are strongly attracted to accepting a course of<br>action or direction for their lives imposed by an external source. Such<br>a relationship absolves the individual from the personal decision-making<br>process. He wraps himself in the security blanket of inevitability or<br>dogma, and need not invest the enormous amounts of time, effort and,<br>above all, the thought required to make creative decisions and meaning-<br>fully participate in the governance of his life.</p>
<p>Responsibility also implies a commitment to others, or as Confucius<br>taught, each of us is meant to rescue the world. It is the business of<br>little minds to shrink from this task or to go about it without enthusiasm.<br>Neither art, nor science, nor any of the great works of humanity would<br>ever come into being without enthusiasm,</p>
<p>The sense of responsibility for doing a job right seems to be<br>declining. In fact, the phrase &quot;I am not responsible&quot; has become a<br>standard response in our society to complaints on a job poorly done.</p>
<p>This response is a semantic error. Generally what a person means is:</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot be held legally liable.&quot;’ Yet, from a moral or ethical point of<br>view, the person who disclaims responsibility is correct: by taking this<br>way out he is truly not responsible; he is irresponsible.</p>
<p>The unwillingness to act and to accept responsibility is a symptom<br>of America&#x27;s growing self-satisfaction with the status quo. The result is<br>a paralysis of the spirit, entirely uncharacteristic of Americans during<br>the previous stages of our history. Even complaints about high taxes and<br>high prices are illusory. Behind them is hidden the reality that the<br>majority, in terms of sheer creature comfort, never had it so good.<br>Those who are still on the outside looking in are not strong or numerous<br>enough to make a political difference.</p>
<p>The task of finding a purpose in life also calls for perseverance. I<br>have seen many young men who rush out into the world with their messages,<br>and when they find out how deaf the world is, they withdraw to wait and<br>save their strength. They believe that after a while they will be able to<br>get up on some little peak from which they can make themselves heard,<br>Each thinks that in a few years he will have gained a standing, and then<br>he can use his power for good. Finally the time comes, and with it a<br>strange discovery: he has lost his horizon of thought. Without perseverance,<br>ambition and a sense of responsibility have evaporated.</p>
<p>Another important principle of existence which gives purpose and</p>
<p>meaning to life is excellence. Because the conviction to strive for</p>
<p>excellence is an intensely personal one, the attainment of excellence is<br>personally satisfying. Happiness comes from the full use of one&#x27;s power<br>to achieve excellence. Life is potentially an empty hole, and there are<br>few more satisfying ways of filling it than by achieving and exercising<br>excellence.</p>
<p>This principle of excellence is one which Americans seem to be<br>losing, and at a time when the Nation stands in need of it. A lack of<br>excellence implies mediocrity. And in a society that is willing to accept<br>a standard of mediocrity, the opportunities for personal failure are<br>boundless. Mediocrity can destroy us just as surely as perils far more<br>famous.</p>
<p>It is important that we distinguish between what it means to fail<br>at a task and what it means to be mediocre. There is all the difference<br>in the world between the life lived with dignity and style which ends in<br>failure, and one which achieves power and glory, yet is dull, unoriginal,<br>unreflective, and mediocre. In areal sense, what matters is not so<br>much whether we make a lot of money or hold a prestigious job; what<br>matters is that we seek out others with knowledge and enthusiasm—that<br>we become people who can enjoy our own company.</p>
<p>In the end, avoiding mediocrity gives us the chance to discover</p>
<p>that success comes in making ourselves into educated individuals, able</p>
<p>to recognize that there is a difference between living with excellence</p>
<p>and living with mediocrity. Sherlock Holmes once told Dr. Watson,<br>&quot;watson, mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself. It takes talent<br>to recognize genius. &#x27;&#x27; To which he could have added, it takes talent to<br>know that what counts is condemning mediocrity not in others but in</p>
<p>ourselves.</p>
<p>We should honor excellence, but not necessarily with material</p>
<p>rewards alone. The Japanese have a custom which I believe it would be</p>
<p>well for us to emulate. Instead of honoring their artists with peerages</p>
<p>or knighthoods, they give them the respectful title, National Human |</p>
<p>Treasure. &quot; | |<br>Creativity is another of the basic principles of existence which I</p>
<p>believe help to give purpose in life. The deepest joy in life is to be</p>
<p>creative. To find an undeveloped situation, to see the possibilities, to</p>
<p>decide upon a course of action, and then devote the whole of one&#x27;s</p>
<p>resources to carry it out, even if it means battling against the stream</p>
<p>of contemporary opinion, is a satisfaction in comparison with which</p>
<p>superficial pleasures are trivial.<br>To create you must care. You must have the courage to speak</p>
<p>out. The world&#x27;s advances always have depended on the courage of its</p>
<p>leaders. A certain measure of courage in the private citizen also is</p>
<p>necessary to the good conduct of the State. Otherwise men who have</p>
<p>power through riches, intrigue, or office will administer the State at</p>
<p>will, and ultimately to their private advantage. For the citizen, this</p>
<p>courage means a frank exposition of a problem and a decrying of the<br>excesses of power. It takes courage to do this because in our polite<br>society frank speech is discouraged, But when this attitude relates to<br>questions involving the welfare or survival of the Nation, it is singularly<br>unfitting to remain evasive. It is not only possible, but in fact a duty</p>
<p>of everyone to state precisely what his knowledge and conscience compel<br>him to say. Many of today&#x27;s problems can be brought forward only by<br>complete candor and frankness; deep respect for the facts, however<br>unpleasant and uncomfortable; great efforts to know them where they are<br>not readily available; and drawing conclusions guided only by rigorous<br>logic.</p>
<p>To have courage means to pursue your goals, or to satisfy your<br>responsibilities, even though others stand in the way and success seems<br>like a dream. It takes courage to stand and fight for what you believe is<br>right. And the fight never ends. You have to start it over again each<br>morning as the sun rises. Sir Thomas More wrote: &quot;If evil persons<br>cannot be quite rooted out, and if you cannot correct habitual attitudes<br>as you wish, you must not therefore abandon the commonwealth. You<br>must strive to guide policy indirectly, so that you make the best of things,<br>and what you cannot turn to good, you can at least make less bad. &quot;</p>
<p>These principles of existence—-responsibility, perseverance,</p>
<p>excellence, creativity, courage-—must be wedded with intellectual growth</p>
<p>and development if we are to find meaning and purpose in our lives.</p>
<p>It is a device of the devil to let sloth into the world, By the age of<br>twenty, some of us already have adopted a granite-like attitude which<br>we maintain throughout life. Intellectually, we must never stop growing.<br>Our conscience should never release us from concern for the problems<br>of the day. Our minds must be forever skeptical, yet questioning. We<br>must strive to be singularly free from that failing so common to man,<br>deplored by Pascal in the &quot;Pensees, &quot;&#x27; of filling our leisure with meaning-<br>less distractions so as to preclude the necessity of thought. To be an<br>intellectual in the fullest sense, one&#x27;s mind must be in constant movement,<br>Aristotle believed that happiness was to be found in the use of the<br>intellect. In other words, ignorance is not bliss; it is oblivion. The<br>inspired prayer does not ask for health, wealth, prosperity, or anything<br>material, but says, &#x27;&#x27;God, illumine my intellect.&#x27;&quot;&#x27; Man cannot find<br>purpose in his life without expanding and using his intellectual qualities<br>and capacities. Liberal learning is a primary source of these qualities.<br>In liberal learning, I refer to discerning taste; wise judgment, informed<br>and critical perspectives that transcend specialized interests and partisan<br>passions; the capacity to understand complexity and to grow in response to it.<br>A cause of many of our mistakes and problems is ignorance—an<br>overwhelming national ignorance of the facts about the rest of the world.<br>A nation, or an individual, cannot function unless the truth is available</p>
<p>and understood; no amount of good on the part of the leaders or the</p>
<p>media will offset ignorance and apathy in the common citizen, Since<br>the United States is a democracy, the broad answer is that all of us<br>must become better informed. Reading is one method of accomplishing<br>this purpose. By spending a few dollars for a book, the thoughts and<br>life&#x27;s work of a great man are available to us.</p>
<p>The proof of living, as Norman Cousins has said, &quot;is in memory,<br>and all of us, through reading, can live five or six lifetimes in one.<br>Through reading, the sluices of the mind open up, making accessible<br>a range of experiences otherwise beyond our personal reach,&quot; In reading<br>books, we grow both emotionally and intellectually.</p>
<p>As areader, man is unique among living things. The ability to<br>read—-and more broadly, the ability to express complex ideas through<br>language—distinguishes him from all other life forms. Without language,<br>complex thought is inconceivable and the mind is undeveloped. The<br>inability to speak and write imprisons thought. In the same vein, sloppy,<br>imprecise thinking begets sloppy, imprecise language. Language and<br>thought are interconnected, and the written word is the vehicle which<br>best advances both.</p>
<p>Therefore, I count reading, and its associated skill, writing, among<br>the most significant of all human efforts. Good writing, after all, is</p>
<p>simply the result of enormous reading, detailed research, and careful</p>
<p>thought. It means studying to gain a good vocabulary, and practicing</p>
<p>to learn how to use it. It seems to me that these kindred skills should</p>
<p>be developed and nourished from the very first, if man is to grow<br>intellectually.</p>
<p>I now will discuss one final principle of existence essential to<br>man&#x27;s purpose in life: the development of standards of ethical and<br>moral conduct. God, it is generally conceded, has made a remarkable<br>job of the physical universe but has, strangely, not done quite so well<br>with the spiritual element. There is abundant evidence around us to<br>conclude that morals and ethics are becoming less prevalent in people&#x27;s<br>lives. The standards of conduct which lay deeply buried in accepted<br>thought for centuries no longer are absolute. Many people seem unable<br>to differentiate between physical relief and moral satisfaction; they<br>confuse material success in life with virtue.</p>
<p>The decline in morals parallels the decline of traditional religion<br>in all areas of our society. In our desire to separate church and state,<br>we have gone to the opposite extreme and have exorcised religious<br>training from our public schools and colleges, thus depriving our youth<br>of the lasting standards of the morals and ethics enunciated by the Ten<br>Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<p>Morals are the quarrel we have with behavior. Any system of<br>education which does not inculcate moral values simply furnishes the</p>
<p>intellectual equipment whereby men and women can better satisfy their</p>
<p>pride, greed, and lust.</p>
<p>We are now living on the accumulated moral capital of traditional</p>
<p>religion. It is running out, and we have no other consensus of values<br>to take its place. This is partly so because man can now obtain on<br>earth what previously was promised him when he reached heaven.</p>
<p>In our system of society, no authority exists to tell us what is<br>good and desirable. We are each free to seek what we think is good<br>in our own way. The danger is that where men compromise truth and<br>let decency slip, they eventually end up with neither. A free society<br>can survive only through men and women of integrity. Fortunately,<br>there still exist human beings who remain concerned about moral and<br>ethical values and justice towards others. These are the individuals<br>who provide hope of the ultimate realism that is marked by a society&#x27;s<br>capacity to survive rather than to be eventually destroyed.</p>
<p>Ethics and morals are basically individual values. A society<br>that does not possess an ethical dimension will find it almost impossible<br>to draft a law to give it that dimension. Law merely deters some men<br>from offending and punishes others for offending. It does not make men<br>good.</p>
<p>It is important also to recognize that morals and ethics are not<br>relative; they do not depend on the situation. This may be the hardest<br>principle to follow in working to achieve goals. The ends, no matter<br>how worthy they appear, cannot justify just any means. Louis Brandeis,</p>
<p>who was deeply convinced of the importance of standards, said: &quot;One</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>can never be sure of ends—political, social, economic. There must</p>
<p>always be doubt and difference of opinion, &#x27;&#x27; But Brandeis had no doubt<br>about means. ‘Fundamentals do not change; centuries of thought have<br>established standards. Lying and sneaking are always bad, no matter<br>what the ends.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a very enabling statement. Life is not meaningless for<br>the man who considers certain actions wrong simply because they are<br>wrong, whether or not they violate a law. This kind of moral code gives<br>a person a focus, a basis on which to conduct himself. Certainly there<br>is a temptation to let go of morals in order to do the expedient thing.<br>But there is also a tremendous power in standing by what is right.<br>Principle and accomplishment need not be incompatible.</p>
<p>A common thread moves through all the principles I have discussed:<br>It is the desire to improve oneself and one&#x27;s surroundings by actively<br>participating in life. Too many succumb to the emotional preference of<br>the comfortable solution instead of the difficult one. It is easy to do<br>nothing.</p>
<p>A person must prepare himself intellectually and professionally,<br>and then use his powers to their fullest extent. This view is well</p>
<p>expressed in two extracts from I Ching, the Confucian Book of Changes:</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>= ==</p>
<p>—The superior man learns and accumulates the results of</p>
<p>his learning; puts questions, and discriminates among those<br>results; dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he<br>has attained to; and carries it into practice with benevolence.</p>
<p>— The superior man nerves himself to ceaseless activity.</p>
<p>It is important to be both a thinker and a doer and to have a sense<br>of responsibility. A theoretician who has no responsibility is withdrawn<br>from the real world. His recommendations are made in a vacuum.<br>Because he is not required to carry them out, they may be irresponsible<br>and do harm. Similarly, those in charge—the doers—are often devoid<br>of any real thought.</p>
<p>To find a purpose to life, one must be willing to act, to put<br>excellence in one&#x27;s work, and concern for what is right before personal<br>safety. Life must be felt, not observed, but to do so means applying<br>oneself to the task daily. Ralph Waldo Emerson said: &quot;God offers to<br>every mind its choice between truth and repose. Take which you please—<br>you can never have both. &quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>No professional man has the right to prefer his own personal peace<br>to the happiness of mankind; his place and his duty are in the frontline</p>
<p>of struggling men, not in the unperturbed ranks of those who keep</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>themselves aloof from life. If a profession is to have its proper place</p>
<p>in the further development of society, it must be increasingly dissatisfied<br>with things as they are. If there is to be any exaltation in one&#x27;s work,<br>one must learn to reach out, not to struggle for that which is just beyond,<br>but to grasp at results which seem almost infinite. Robert Browning<br>wrote, &#x27;&#x27;Ah, but a man&#x27;s reach should exceed his grasp, or what&#x27;s a<br>Heaven for.&quot;</p>
<p>Man&#x27;s work begins with his job; his profession. Having a vocation<br>is something of a miracle, like falling in love. I can understand why<br>Luther said that a man is justified by his vocation, for it is a proof of<br>God&#x27;s favor. But having a vocation means more than punching a time-<br>clock. It means guarding against banality, ineptitude, incompetence,<br>and mediocrity. A man should strive to become a locus of excellence.</p>
<p>Most of the work in the world today is done by those who work<br>too hard; they comprise a &quot;nucleus of martyrs.&quot; The greater part of<br>the remaining workers&#x27; energy goes into complaining. Employees today<br>seldom become emotional about their organizations or its output; they<br>are only interested in getting ahead. And many organizations are killing<br>their employees with kindness, undercutting their sense of responsibility<br>with an ever-increasing permissiveness. This is a fatal error. For</p>
<p>where responsibility ends, performance ends also.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>We measure ourselves by many standards, &quot;&#x27; said William James.</p>
<p>&quot;our strength and our intelligence, our wealth and even our good luck,<br>are things which warm our hearts and make us feel ourselves a match<br>for life. But deeper than all such things, and able to suffice unto itself<br>without them, is the sense of the amount of effort which we can put forth. &quot;<br>Man has a large capacity for effort. But it is so much greater than we<br>think it is, that few ever reach this capacity.</p>
<p>We should value the faculty of knowing what we ought to do and<br>having the will to do it. But understanding is easy. It is the doing that<br>is difficult, The critical issue is not what we know but what we do with<br>what we know. The great end of life is not knowledge but action.<br>Theodore Roosevelt expressed this concept well in his &quot;Man in the Arena&quot;<br>passage:</p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out<br>how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might<br>have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is<br>actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and<br>dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes<br>short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the<br>great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who,<br>if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who,<br>if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place<br>shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither</p>
<p>victory nor defeat.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>The man in the arena has found a purpose in life. He daily experiences</p>
<p>Emerson&#x27;s declaration that nothing is achieved without enthusiasm. He<br>knows that men seldom come within shouting distance of their hopes for<br>themselves. Yet he does not quit in resignation as have those who have<br>taken trouble with nothing except to be born. In his work he is buffeted<br>from two sides, challenged by his own ideas which revolt at the compro-<br>mises of reality, and assaulted by reality which fights the ideas. He<br>spends himself in that struggle, and he wins by a constant renewal of<br>effort in which he refuses to sink either into placid acceptance of the<br>situation or into self-aatistaction,</p>
<p>I believe it is the duty of each of us to act as if the fate of the world<br>depended on him. Admittedly, one man by himself cannot do the job.<br>However, one man can make a difference. It is with this conviction that<br>we squarely confront our duty to posterity. We must live for the future<br>of the human race and not for our own comfort or success. Each of us<br>is obligated to bring his individual and independent capacities to bear<br>upon a wide range of human concerns.</p>
<p>For anyone seeking meaning for his life, a figure from Greek<br>mythology comes to mind, It is that of Atlas, bearing with endless<br>perseverance the weight of the heavens on his back. It is Atlas, reso-<br>lutely bearing his burden and accepting his responsibility that gives us</p>
<p>the example we seek.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>-<br>|</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>f</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>To seek out and accept responsibility; to persevere; to be committed</p>
<p>to excellence; to be creative and courageous; to be unrelenting in the<br>pursuit of intellectual development; to maintain high standards of ethics<br>and morality; and to bring these basic principles of existence to bear<br>through active participation in life—-these are some of my ideas on the</p>
<p>goals which must be met to achieve meaning and purpose in life.</p>
