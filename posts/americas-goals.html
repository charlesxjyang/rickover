      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1960 paper &quot;America&#x27;s Goals,&quot; Admiral H.G. Rickover asserts that the United States, having been thrust into global leadership amidst the Scientific Revolution and the Cold War, must redefine its national purpose to ensure survival against totalitarianism. He argues that the nation&#x27;s 18th-century founding principles, focused on individual liberties (citing the Declaration of Independence and Constitution), must evolve to prioritize national strength and unity, especially given the irrationality of war in the age of hydrogen bombs and the impossibility of isolation due to modern technology. Rickover stresses the critical importance of a robust educational system for technological prowess and calls for citizens to subordinate individual and group interests to the greater national good, critiquing complacency and the undermining of self-reliance. He reinforces his arguments with references to Lord Acton&#x27;s dictum on power, Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;social contract,&quot; Shakespeare&#x27;s depiction of national identity, Goethe&#x27;s observations on complacency, and Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s requirements for a successful democracy.</p>

<p>time pushed into remote corners. Strangely enough, the settlers were hardly conscious of being conquerors. They had not come here as members of a military expedition, headed by a prince looking for a kingdom. America was conquered by humble people, arriving singly, in families and in small groups. To them America was an empty wilderness, where they would carve out better lives for themselves and their children. For most this was a private venture; few had government backing, though government lost no time using these individual conquests to lay claim to the land so won. Of course, neither settlers nor governments had any valid legal claim to this land. It was not empty; the Indians had lived here thousands of years. But by declaring the Indians to be heathen savages, entitled to no recognition in International Law, the European invaders established the spurious "right of discovery." By virtue of this ingenious fiction, the Indian became invisible in law.</p>
<p>When the colonists threw off "absolute despotism," they set up a wholly new kind of nation on a political tabula rasa. Our national life really began with this deliberate act; it marks the real start of a common past for most present-day Americans. The United States was created by something closely akin to Rousseau's "social contract." Individuals had subdued this continent, won independence, and now were agreed to establish a political union.</p>
<p>Our political institutions reflect 18th century rationalism, which was wholly concerned with securing individual rights, and all but oblivious of a more basic need: the state's power to survive onslaughts of foreign nations. Our state and federal governments are governments of limited power both in their relations with the citizen, and in their relations with one another. To expand their powers has deliberately been made a slow and cumbersome process.</p>
<p>The machinery of government established more than 170 years ago has stood the test of time remarkably well. Through amendment and judicial interpretation, the powers of the states and of the United States have been greatly expanded -- on the whole wisely. But around this political machinery have grown encrustations of procedure that tend AT TIMES to paralyze government action. Private and public bureaucracies enlist loyalties that are SOMETIMES put above loyalty to the nation as a whole. Battles among government agencies and between pressure groups run counter to obvious national interest, as when different branches of the military service quarrel so wholeheartedly that AS the real enemy is almost lost from sight; AS when the country's need for a stable currency is disregarded in the battle to give the wage-price spiral another twist upward. We are in danger of becoming a pressure-group state.</p>
<p>We need to cultivate a questing turn of mind that is not overawed by the alleged sanctity of the status quo. Novel procedures must be devised to meet novel problems, since all routines eventually become obsolete. Rational persons know change is a part of life; they distinguish between the fixed principles we accept as guides to living, and the changing methods through which we seek to give them substance.</p>
<p>Principles are distillations of human wisdom and experience, having a long life. Changes in the physical conditions of life rarely touch them; they are overturned only during those infrequent upheavals when men reverse the ideals they live by. But in times of great change in our material world it often becomes necessary to alter our procedures so that they will continue to promote ideals and principles upon which we are agreed.</p>
<p>Proposals that we review, and if necessary change, accustomed ways of thinking and acting are always resisted by people who are not governed by reason. They rarely appreciate how necessary such change may be, for as Goethe wrote, "fools are never uneasy." Complacency is rarely found among persons with active minds; it is the disease of the uneducated, the unintelligent, the mentally lazy, who prefer clichés to independent thought. Since abstract ideas are troublesome to such people, they tend to put their trust in the concrete institutions through which we realize our basic principles, instead of in the principles themselves. This is dangerous thinking at a time when changes in the world come overnight.</p>
<p>To retain the essence of the principles and ideals we believe in, we must be flexible in our procedures, and ready to change institutions when they no longer serve our purpose. The mixture of individual, community and national interests must occasionally be altered to preserve the democratic ideal. This country's most forceful teacher of democracy, Theodore Roosevelt, warned us time and again against dogmatism, and urged that we make decisions on practical grounds. We should not be misled into believing that democracy itself limits a people's freedom to create and change the machinery of government.</p>
<p>A democratic nation reflects the human qualities of its people. It cannot have a firm purpose in the world if its citizens lead aimless lives. The shadow that has fallen lately on America's once exuberant self-confidence comes from lack of definite objectives and wholehearted readiness to commit ourselves to them, if necessary by sacrifice of personal comfort or luxury. We have an uneasy feeling that something has gone wrong with the American dream. Already surrounded by gadgets, we hear promises of a pushbutton world just around the corner, where machines will do our work and our thinking, where every American will live like a king, served by mechanical slaves and entertained twenty-four hours a day with nursery stories about "happy people with happy problems."</p>
<p>Gifted men who largely shape our thinking through mass media all too often abuse their great talents by promoting the erroneous belief that democracy can serve no higher ideal than private gain and maximum consumption of goods. It could be that we are becoming bored with their shrill voices; that we are beginning to realize the emptiness of a life centered on material possessions. Perhaps our frustration is a sign that we are rediscovering the truth that man does not live by bread alone -- nor by labor-saving machinery, superhighways, and a pursuit of a good time.</p>
<p>No democratic nation can successfully pursue its international objectives unless its people are willing to subordinate private interest to national interest in all areas where the country's world position is at stake. Our country needs enormous technological, economic, military, and political strength to accomplish its national goal. The test of democracy today is whether free citizens will voluntarily make the necessary sacrifices to strengthen their nation that totalitarian subjects are ordered to make. This calls for a strong sense of civic responsibility, to be found only among self-reliant individuals. Traditionally, self-reliance and self-determination have been typically American qualities. But of late, these qualities have been subtly undermined by a new view of the individual. The so-called "Freudian Ethic" has led us astray by encouraging us to blame our personal inadequacies on "society." In their preoccupation with people who -- because of misfortune or weakness of mind or character -- cannot cope with life in a modern industrial society, psychologists generally fail to emphasize that what may be condoned in the weak cannot be excused in the strong.</p>
<p>Such an attitude undermines the spiritual foundations of democracy. When we shift responsibility for his actions from the individual to society, we are well on the way to totalitarianism.</p>
<p>In the perilous times through which we are passing, it is important to keep in mind two basic requirements for a successful democracy. Half a century ago, Theodore Roosevelt laid them before us with these words: "Only a people of sound intelligence, and above all, of robust character is fit to govern itself. No gift of popular institutions will avail if the people who receive them do not possess certain great and masterful qualities; and above all the combination of two qualities -- individual self-reliance and the power of combining for the common good."</p>
