      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This speech by Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, delivered at the keel-laying ceremony for the Nuclear Frigate CALIFORNIA (DLGN36) on January 23, 1970, introduces and commends Mrs. Glenard P. Lipscomb of Los Angeles, California. Rickover highlights Mrs. Lipscomb&#x27;s dedicated role as a Congressional wife, actively campaigning with her husband, and her community involvement with organizations like the Red Cross and the Florence Crittenton Home. The speech also extensively praises her husband, Congressman Glenard P. Lipscomb, for his extensive public service, including nine consecutive terms in Congress, his leadership as ranking Republican Member on the House Appropriations Committee, and his reputation as a patriot, statesman, and dedicated American who served his District, State, and the Nation with distinction since his election to the California State Legislature in 1947 and Congress in 1953.</p>

<p>Introduction of Mrs. Glenard P,. Lipscomb, Los Angeles, California by Vice Admiral H. Gc. Rickover, USN on the occasion of the keel laying of the Nuclear Frigate CALIFORNIA (DLGN36) at Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company</p>
<p>Newport News, Virginia, January 23, 1970</p>
<p>I have the privilege and pleasure of introducing a most gracious lady from California who has the leading role in the ceremony for which we are assembled.</p>
<p>We are honored by her presence--~a woman who has devoted her adult life to being a partner and an help meet of one of the great members of our House of Representatives-=-~a patriot, a statesman, a gentleman, a dedicated American: Congressman Glenard P. Lipscomb.</p>
<p>Virginia Lipscomb was born in Binghamton, New York but moved to California as a child. She attended Belmont High School in Los Angeles where she met her husband.</p>
<p>The Lipscomb's have two daughters: Diane, who will assist her mother in the ceremony today, and Joyce who lives in California.</p>
<p>In 1947 Congressman Lipscomb was elected to the California State Legislature where he served until elected to Congress in 1953. As is typical of Congressional wives, Mrs. Lipscomb campaigned</p>
<p>actively with her husband and has remained close to his Congressional</p>
<p>activities. In addition, she has devoted considerable time to Red Cross work and to the Florence Crittenton Home for unwed mothers of Washington, D.C. She is an active member of the Congressional Club and has served as its Vice President. Congressman Lipscomb could not be with us today. I cherish his friendship; I know of no finer gentleman. He has the spirit of compassion and understanding; he inspires one. No words can express the energy and the wisdom he has devoted to his country. Nine consecutive terms in the House speak eloquently of his success. Since 1958 he has served on the powerful House Appro- priations Committee which appropriates money to operate the Federal Government. He is ranking Republican Member of its Defense Subcommittee and serves on the Subcommittee handling appropriations for the Departments of State, Justice, Commerce,/ the Federal Judiciary and related agencies. In addition he is the ranking Minority Member of the Committee on House Administration. He is a Member of the Joint Senate-House Committee on Printing. Since 1959 he has also been Chairman of the California Republican Delegation in Congress. His success can be measured by his accomplishments and by the high esteem and great affection he holds among his Congressional colleagues. His keen intellect and diligent research have resulted in better programs for America, especially America of the future. His voice is a steady one--a voice of decency, of conservatism, of patriotism. He renders great service to his District, to his State</p>
<p>and to the Nation.</p>
<p>It has been my privilege to know him for many years; to know how much he has helped the Naval Nuclear Program. He has had a great impact upon me because of the force of his character, the quality of his mind, his integrity. He is forthright, without guile, outspoken in his convictions, strong in his faith and love of country. He consistently speaks and fights for what he believes to be right. It has been a great comfort to me to be able to go to so fine a man for his help and kindly advice. I am grateful that our Congress has a man like Congressman Lipscomb, who has done so much for the United States. It is only through the intense efforts of such men that our form of Government can be preserved.</p>
<p>I have always admired and appreciated his concern and tenderness for his wife--who has contributed so much to his accomplishments.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is with a deep sense of pride that I introduce to you Glenard Lipscomb's lifelong partner, Virginia Lipscomb. She honors the Navy and the State of California by authenticating the keel of this ship which will bear the name of</p>
<p>her great state.</p>
