      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document presents Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s remarks and a speech titled &quot;A Humanistic Technology,&quot; delivered on May 7, 1975. Rickover begins with a heartfelt tribute to Congressman George H. Mahon, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, highlighting Mahon&#x27;s dedication to a strong national defense and modern nuclear Navy. The main speech argues for a &quot;humanistic technology,&quot; asserting that technology must serve human interests rather than dictate them, and emphasizes a critical distinction between science (immutable knowledge) and technology (actions based on knowledge, which are debatable and can be harmful). Rickover critiques the historical misuse of technology, citing the near-extinction of whales (referencing R.A. Piddlington&#x27;s *The Limits of Mankind*), widespread pollution, and the tragic consequences of dangerous drugs like thalidomide, while also mentioning Rachel Carson&#x27;s *Silent Spring* in relation to pesticides. He advocates for stronger protective laws based on the principle of &quot;mutuality of liberty&quot; and stresses the need to professionalize engineering, similar to medicine, to ensure that human welfare guides technological development.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Remarks</p>
<p>by<br>Admiral H, G, Rickover, U.S. Navy<br>at the<br>Thirteenth Annual Meeting<br>of the<br>Permian Basin Petroleum Association<br>Midland Country Club<br>Midland, Texas<br>Wednesday, May 7, 1975</p>
<p>Before starting my Speech I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge<br>the contributions of a distinguished Texan and one of the great men of our<br>Congress, The Honorable George H, Mahon,</p>
<p>I have known Congressman Mahon for more than a quarter of a century,<br>In all that time he has never wavered from his ceaseless devotion toa<br>strong defense for the United States, He has been and continues to be at<br>the forefront of those in Congress who fight for a modern nuclear powered<br>Navy. He knows that in today&#x27;s troubled world, if one might err in<br>judgment it is better to err on the side of strength than on the side of<br>weakness,</p>
<p>To know him is to be attracted to him. Not that he has ever made any<br>attempt to curry favor or radiate charm. On occasion he can be sharp,<br>even curt, He is not a man to suffer fools gladly. But no one can be</p>
<p>associated with him for long and not sense an underlying warmth and</p>
<p>kindliness,</p>
<p>The casual observer, considering this man who began his working<br>life so modestly and became what we have known him to be, might say<br>that fortune smiled on him and that he was lucky. But has anything—</p>
<p>any advancement, any distinction, any responsibility—ever come to him<br>that he has not earned by application and industry, by sheer force of mind,<br>character and integrity ?</p>
<p>There is no affectation in him, no false humility. He knows his<br>capacities, and takes pride in them, He looks on them as a trust of<br>which he must be the diligent and faithful steward, The people to whom<br>he responds are those who have ability and put it to full use, who daunted<br>neither by toil nor difficulty, give themselves without reserve to the<br>work they have in hand,</p>
<p>He is a prodigious worker himself. Nothing less than full mastery<br>of any subject he tackles will satisfy him, When circumstances make it<br>impossible to realize that goal, he regards it as a matter for self-reproach.<br>Although a man of intense convictions, he is always open-minded, and he<br>is not beyond persuasion until the last word has been spoken,</p>
<p>He knows what his goals are at all times, and he has the ability, the<br>experience, the determination, the strength of character combined with<br>high resolve and patriotism, to perform his duties in the best interest, as<br>he honestly conceives it, of this nation,</p>
<p>He is patient, laborious, and intelligent at his task. He is shrewd in</p>
<p>judgment and sound in decision, He has the gift of instantly seeing the</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>main point at issue, no matter how much it is covered up with a mass</p>
<p>of details, and the courage to speak out his mind at once. He has<br>vividness, he has sensitivity, sharpness; he has wit, he has a tremendous<br>sense of the essence of human character,</p>
<p>Ever a gentleman, he is thoughtful of individuals regardless of<br>viewpoint, He is helpful and understanding in all official matters,</p>
<p>affectionate and sympathetic in any private concern,</p>
<p>His standards of high integrity and honor, professional conduct and<br>competence, are of immense importance to the well-being of our country<br>in an age when the values on which the continuance of civilization and<br>organized human society depend are being questioned. He is an idealist<br>and pragmatist, a complex of courage and expediency, intolerant of i<br>pettiness and sham,</p>
<p>Some may find themselves in disagreement with the way he applies<br>his philosophy, but no one ever doubts the sincerity with which it is held,<br>or the integrity with which it is offered, And those who work with him and<br>see his day-to-day conduct, in Congress and outside it, know that he is<br>sensitive, honest, intelligent, aware of and often sympathetic to opposing<br>arguments, generous even to those who oppose him, and capable of<br>admitting a mistake,</p>
<p>Sometimes he is tough. One has to be and ought to be when dealing<br>with such important matters as the defense and welfare of this great nation.<br>But he is always fair.</p>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>As the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee he is one</p>
<p>&quot; of the few officials in our Government upon whom the responsibility rests</p>
<p>to recommend to Congress the specific allocation of funds for each and</p>
<p>every phase of work to be supported by the Federal Government, His<br>experience on the Appropriations Committee for over three decades and<br>as Chairman of the full committee for the last eleven years has provided<br>him a unique vantage point from which to view our defense,</p>
<p>The record he has made is memorable and outstanding in its import<br>and impact upon the national welfare. His decisions affect the life of<br>every American,</p>
<p>Now to my speech—A HUMANISTIC TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>fiS SPEECH REFLECTS THE VIEWS FOR RELEASE 17:00 PM (CDT)</p>
<p>JF THE AUTHOR AND DOES NOT WEDNESDAY, MAY 7, 1975<br>NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VIEWS<br>OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY<br>OR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY</p>
<p>A HUMANISTIC TECHNOLOGY<br>by<br>Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy<br>at the<br>Thirteenth Annual Meeting<br>of the<br>Permian Basin Petroleum Association<br>Midland Country Club<br>Midland, Texas<br>Wednesday, May 7, 1975</p>
<p>Change is now part of life in all industrially advanced countries—<br>continuous, rapid, all-pervading change. The ultimate cause of this<br>unsettling situation is the explosion of science: factual knowledge<br>doubles every decade or so, Its direct cause is the technological<br>revolution: new knowledge is put to practical use about as rapidly as<br>knowledge itself expands,</p>
<p>The impact of technology on individuals and on society at large is<br>profoundly affected by the attitude of the public and of its leaders toward<br>technology; that is, by prevailing concepts of what technology is and<br>what purpose it should serve.</p>
<p>When technology is believed to be a force with a momentum of its own<br>that puts it beyond human direction or restraint, it may become a Franken-<br>stein manster destroying its creator. But when it is viewed humanistically,<br>in other words, as a means to human ends, it can be made to produce</p>

<p>maximum benefit and do minimum harm to human beings, and to the values</p>
<p>that make for civilized living.</p>
<p>I propose to show there is a tendency in contemporary thinking to<br>regard technology as an irresistible force rather than a tool. The tendency<br>is more pronounced in some countries than in others but is observable<br>wherever there is rapid technological progress. Since it encourages the<br>use of technology in ways that on balance are harmful, this viewpoint should<br>be replaced by a humanistic attitude—an attitude that looks upon technology<br>as an instrument created for no other purpose than to serve man.</p>
<p>Technology is tools, techniques, procedures, things; the artifacts<br>fashioned by modern industrial man to increase his powers of mind and<br>body. Marvelous they are, but let us not be overawed by these artifacts.<br>Certainly they, themselves, do not dictate how we should use them nor,<br>by their mere existence, do they authorize actions that were not<br>anteriorly lawful. We alone bear responsibility for our technology. In<br>this, as in all our actions, we are bound by the principles governing human<br>behavior in our society. Ethics, I hardly need say, are not only personal<br>but social as well.</p>
<p>This cannot be overemphasized for the notion is widespread that,<br>having wrought vast changes in the material conditions of life, technology<br>perforce renders obsolete traditional concepts of ethics and morals, as</p>
<p>well as accustomed ways of arranging political and social relationships.</p>
<p>Earnest debates are currently taking place as to whether it is possible to<br>act morally in the new technological society, and proposals have been<br>made—-quite seriously——that science must now replace traditional ethics!<br>We have here a confusion of means with ends that should be cleared up.</p>
<p>The laws disclosed by science must, of course, be heeded by those<br>who wish to exploit scientific discoveries; in his technological activities<br>man is bound by the laws of science. But it does not follow that he is<br>bound by the laws of science in his purely human relations as well.<br>&quot;Science, &#x27;&#x27; wrote Vannevar Bush, &quot;has come a long way, in delineating the<br>probable nature of the universe that surrounds us, of the physical world<br>in which we live, of our own structure, our physical and chemical nature,<br>It even enters into the mechanism by which the brain itself operates. Then<br>it comes to the question of consciousness and free will—and there it stops.<br>No longer can science prove, or even bear evidence. Those who base their<br>personal philosophies or their religion upon science are left, beyond that<br>point, without support. &quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>Through technology, man has been relieved of much brutal, exhausting,<br>physical labor as well as boring routine work. Why should the ease and<br>affluence made possible by technology affect precepts that have guided<br>Western man for centuries? This may brand me as old-fashioned but I<br>have not yet found occasion to discard a single principle that was accepted<br>in the America of my youth. Why should anyone feel in need of a new ethical<br>code because he is healthier or because he has acquired better tools for</p>
<p>doing his work ?</p>
<p>ti<br>b<br>ih<br>F<br>:</p>
<p>Tools are for utilizing the external resources at our disposal,</p>
<p>principles are for marshaling our inner, our human resources. With</p>
<p>tools we alter our physical environment; principles serve to order our</p>
<p>personal life and our relations with others. The two have nothing to do with</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>It disturbs me to be told that technology &quot;demands&quot; an action the<br>speaker favors, or that &quot;you can&#x27;t stop progress. &#x27;&quot; It troubles me that<br>we are so easily pressured by purveyors of technology into permitting<br>so-called &quot;progress&quot; to alter our lives, without attempting to control it-—<br>as if technology were an irrepressible force of nature to which we must<br>meekly submit. If we reflected, we might discover that not everything<br>hailed as progress contributes to happiness; that the new is not always<br>better nor the old always outdated.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are receptive to these arguments because we tend to<br>confuse technology with science. Not only in popular thinking but even<br>among the well-informed the two are not always clearly distinguished.<br>In consequence, characteristics pertaining to science are attributed to<br>technology.</p>
<p>Science has to do with discovering the true facts and relationships<br>of observable phenomena in nature, and with establishing theories that<br>serve to organize masses of verified data concerning these facts and<br>relationships. Because of the care scientists take to verify the facts</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>supporting their theories, and their readiness to alter theories when</p>
<p>new facts prove an established theory to be imperfect, science has<br>great authority. What the scientific community accepts as proven is<br>not questioned by the public. No one disputes that the earth attracts<br>the moon, or that atomic fission produces energy.</p>
<p>But technology cannot claim the authority of science. It is properly</p>
<p>a subject of debate, not alone by experts but by the public as well. It</p>
<p>has proved anything but infallibly beneficial. Much harm has been done<br>to man and nature because technologies have been used with no thought</p>
<p>for the possible consequences of their interaction with nature. A certain<br>ruthlessness has been encouraged by the mistaken belief that to disregard<br>human considerations is as necessary in technology as it is in science.<br>The analogy is false.</p>
<p>The methods of science require rigorous exclusion of the human<br>factor. They were developed to serve the needs of scientists, whose sole<br>interest is to comprehend the universe; to know the truth; to know it<br>accurately and with certainty. The searcher for truth cannot pay attention<br>to his own or other people&#x27;s likes and dislikes, or to popular ideas of the<br>fitness of things. This is why science is the antithesis of &quot;humanism, &quot;&#x27;<br>despite the fact that historically modern science developed out of and<br>parallel to the humanism of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Science, being pure thought, harms no one; therefore it need not<br>be humanistic, But technology is action, and often potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>9)</p>
<p>Unless it is made to adapt itself to human interests, needs, values, and<br>principles, more harm will be done than good. Never before, in all his<br>long life on earth, has man possessed such enormous power to injure<br>his human fellows and his society as has been put into his hands by<br>modern technology.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to maintain a humanistic attitude toward<br>technology; to recognize clearly that, since it is a product of human<br>effort, technology can have no legitimate purpose but to serve man—man<br>in general, not merely some men; future generations, not merely those<br>who currently wish to gain advantage for themselves; man in the totality<br>of his humanity, encompassing all his manifold interests and needs, not<br>merely some one particular concern of his. Humanistically viewed,<br>technology is not an end in itself but a means to an end; the end being<br>determined by man himself in accordance with the laws prevailing in his<br>society.</p>
<p>The word law has come to have two disparate meanings: Law, as<br>commonly understood, refers to those rules of human conduct prescribed<br>and enforced by society. Scientists who have appropriated the term use<br>it to describe regularities exhibited by physical phenomena. In the<br>transition, the word has taken on a new meaning.</p>
<p>Law that governs human society is not the result of scientific method,<br>but of wisdom and experience. This law is always debatable and can be<br>changed. What the scientist calls law is really immutable fact. Or, if</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>you prefer, it is law operating in a sphere where man exercises no<br>influence. He cannot alter the laws of the cosmos; he can only discover<br>them. Scientific law has relevance for man only because it makes the<br>universe more comprehensible to him and, by disclosing how nature<br>works, allows him to utilize the forces of nature for his own purposes,<br>When we make use of these forces, we must, of course, heed the<br>laws of science which describe their behavior; they are laws we cannot<br>bend to our will. But we must likewise heed the man-made laws of our<br>society, for technology is action which affects fellow human beings.<br>Technology, therefore, is Subject to both the law of the cosmos and the</p>
<p>law of man. Much confusion in popular thinking arises from this fact,</p>
<p>The two laws are confounded, Or, to put it differently, they are thought</p>
<p>7 ==<br>aay</p>
<p>to be part of a Single system of law so that one or the other must perforce</p>
<p>take precedence.</p>
<p>Ever since science discovered that the earth is not the center of the</p>
<p>watt 5 Saati el ie</p>
<p>eS</p>
<p>cosmos, as had been maintained by the highest human authorities, we have</p>
<p>Sars Ect</p>
<p>been learning painfully that the laws of science cannot be overturned by</p>
<p>human fiat. Today, acceptance of duly authenticated Scientific theories</p>
<p>eae Tan<br>ji —</p>
<p>= = 7 = aH<br>ofa Ti<br>cin ofes</p>
<p>or laws is common practice in enlightened countries.</p>
<p>It has taken a long time to attain this rational attitude toward science,<br>and we are conscious of the consequences of intolerance in the past,<br>Perhaps this is why we have been excessively tolerant toward those who</p>
<p>Claim the right to use technology as they see fit, and who are wont to treat</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>every attempt by society to regulate such use in the public interest as</p>
<p>if it were a modern repetition of the persecution of Galileo!</p>
<p>Assuredly, we have the right to use the instrumentality of law and<br>of government to protect ourselves against technological injury. Yet<br>this simple truth is obscured by the effective way in which opponents of<br>protective measures play upon the layman&#x27;s respect for science—in a<br>conscious or unconscious attempt to brainwash the public so it will accept<br>their argument without debate. When attacking legislation that would<br>restrain the user of technology, it is common practice to argue as if at<br>issue were acceptance of a law of science. Yet what is being discussed<br>is not science but the advisability or legality of the technological<br>exploitation of science. The public would not be deceived by such<br>arguments if it clearly understood the fundamental difference between<br>science—which is pure knowledge-—and technology—which is action<br>based on knowledge.</p>
<p>To guard against being misled, one should cultivate an attitude of<br>skepticism whenever the word science is used. Is it science that is being<br>discussed or is it technology? If technology, the question at once arises<br>whether the proposed action is legally permissible and socially desirable.<br>Technology must conform to that most basic of all legal maxims, the<br>&quot;mutuality of liberty&quot;; the principle that one man&#x27;s liberty of action ends<br>where it would injure another. Without this maxim, freedom would be a</p>
<p>barren privilege.</p>
<p>Humanistically viewed, technology can have no legitimacy unless</p>
<p>it inflicts no harm, Granted this premise, the prerequisite for users</p>
<p>of technology is—or ought to be—that they comprehend and respect the<br>laws of science applicable to their particular technology; that they<br>exercise a prudent man&#x27;s care in assessing the probable consequences</p>
<p>of this technology; and, should it be potentially harmful, that they abstain<br>from using the technology until they have found ways to render it harmless.</p>
<p>Whether or not a particular technology has harmful potentialities<br>ought not to be decided unilaterally by those who wish to use it. Destructive<br>technologies are often highly profitable for those promoting them. They<br>are an interested party to the conflict between private and public interest<br>that every potentially harmful technology poses. Moreover, they are<br>nearly always practical men more knowledgeable about efficiency in using<br>a technology than about the legal and scientific implications of such use.</p>
<p>A broader range of intellectual power should be brought to bear on<br>the whole question of technological exploitation of scientific knowledge.<br>Purely practical considerations should be supplemented with scholarly<br>knowledge of long-range consequences; private interest in efficiency with<br>public interest in safety. The practical approach to a new scientific<br>discovery and its utilization through technology is usually short-range<br>and private, concerned only with ways to put the discovery to use in the<br>most economical and efficient manner, little thought being given to its</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ultimate consequences. The scholarly approach—-if I may use this<br>term—is long-range and public; it looks to the effects which a new<br>technology may have on people in general, on the nation, on the world;<br>on present and future generations. Both approaches are necessary to<br>illuminate the problem and help solve it. To exclude the one or the<br>other prevents finding the way to a humanistic technology.</p>
<p>I can best illustrate what I want to bring out by a simple example.<br>Commercial deep-sea fishing can be done so efficiently with modern<br>techniques that a few enterprises could rapidly sweep the oceans free<br>of commercial fish. And this is what the fishermen of all nationalities<br>wish to do. As practical men, they are interested only in using technology<br>to increase their catch, preserve it, and get it to market as speedily as<br>possible. In pursuing this short-range private objective, they have been<br>quite ingenious. Figuratively speaking, the world&#x27;s marine scholars have<br>stood by wringing their hands at the fishermen&#x27;s &quot;practical&quot; folly. To<br>the scholars it has been incomprehensible that rational human beings<br>should fail to see that in the end more can be taken from the sea if<br>fishing conforms to sensible conservation measures which permit the<br>species to reproduce itself.</p>
<p>We witness at the moment the end of one of the saddest cases of<br>misuse of technology by greedy fishing interests. Unless these interests<br>are curbed by truly effective international action, the great whales—the<br>blue, the finback, the sperm-—will soon disappear, victims of man&#x27;s</p>
<p>&quot;practical&quot; folly.<br>10</p>
<p>These and other whales once populated the high seas in immense<br>numbers. For hundreds of years whaling remained a reasonably fair<br>contest between man and the intelligent, swift-moving mammals he<br>hunted. Modern technology has turned it into brutal genocide. Blindly<br>pursuing what they doubtless consider an eminently practical objective<br>maximum profit today—the whalers are wiping out the very resources<br>that could insure them a profit tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hunting of the blue whale has now been prohibited, but not so for<br>the finback whale. Ten of the whaling nations are now willing to ban the<br>catching and killing of all whales—Japan and Russia will not agree,<br>Thus, despite long efforts to regulate whaling, the problem still exists.</p>
<p>Practical considerations aside, is anyone justified in using<br>technology to exterminate a species that has existed on this earth for<br>eons-—the largest animal the world has ever seen? Are we certain our<br>descendants may not at some future time have need of these mammals?<br>R. A. Piddlington, in his book The Limits of Mankind, remarks that<br>nobody knows what the biological consequences are likely to be of the<br>whales&#x27; extermination. &quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;if nearly a million of these<br>huge animals, with their enormous appetites, can be removed in a<br>Single generation from the balance of marine life without Causing violent<br>repercussions, all our previous experience of this subject has given us</p>
<p>the wrong answers,&quot;</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Irretrievable damage has been done by those who use technology</p>
<p>without giving thought to its effect on our environment. Waste products,<br>carelessly emitted, create a massive problem of soil, water, and air<br>pollution—we may be damaging the atmosphere permanently by changing<br>its chemical composition. Wholesale slaughter of wild animals upsets<br>the ecology with consequences we cannot even fathom as yet.</p>
<p>Insofar as damage is still remediable—and much of it can never<br>be undone—it must be remedied by public action, at taxpayer&#x27;s expense.<br>The total cost to the public of private carelessness and willfulness in the<br>use of technology will be enormous.</p>
<p>Experience shows that by itself, the legal maxim of &quot;the mutuality<br>of liberty&quot; will not prevent premature commitment to technologies that<br>may later prove harmful. The maxim must be implemented by preventive<br>public action—action of the kind that has long been operative in the field<br>of public health. There is need for laws requiring that before a particular<br>technology may be used, reliable tests must have been made to prove it<br>will be useful and safe. A few such laws are already on the statute books;<br>more are needed. But we rarely get positive action until a human tragedy<br>dramatizes the need for protection.</p>
<p>In the United States we now have preventive laws protecting the<br>public against dangerous drugs. The first law, strongly opposed by the</p>
<p>pharmaceutical interests, did not pass until a major tragedy had occurred—</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>the death of a considerable number of patients who had taken a drug</p>
<p>which was effective in the treatment of their particular disease, but<br>had unfenessen aide effects proving fatal to some. After much<br>procrastination, a second, more stringent law was passed, but not<br>until the uproar over the thalidomide babies caused the legislators to<br>respond with alacrity.</p>
<p>Though a technology may clearly harm paramount human values,<br>restraining laws are generally not enacted unless public demand is<br>sufficiently vocal and persistent to wear down the opposition of those<br>with a vested interest in the harmful technology. Opposition tactics<br>follow a pattern that is monotonously repeated whenever the attempt<br>is made to regulate a technology in the public interest. It is well to<br>familiarize oneself with the pattern.</p>
<p>I have mentioned efforts to confuse the issue by arguing as if a<br>law of science were at issue when, in fact, the proposed legislation<br>deals with technology, not science. If this argument fails, the need<br>for the proposed law is then categorically denied. Warnings of<br>scientists are rejected as &quot;unproven&quot; and &quot;exaggerated.&quot;&#x27; Later,<br>when these prove to have been entirely correct, the argument shifts<br>from the substantive question of whether a technology is harmful to<br>an attack on the legitimacy of any kind of protective legislation. Such<br>legislation would violate basic liberties, it is claimed; it would</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>establish government tyranny and subvert free democratic institutions.<br>If all this proves futile and legislation is imminent, there will be urgent<br>demands it be postponed until &#x27;&#x27;more research&quot; can be undertaken to<br>establish the appositeness of the proposed law.</p>
<p>These delaying tactics are highly effective. It takes firm commitment<br>to a humanistic technology to push through needed legislation as well as<br>thorough understanding of the filibustering tactics of opponents, and great<br>skill in combating these tactics. No wonder public opinion and the law<br>have nowhere fully caught up with those who misuse technology. Often<br>as not they escape with impunity, no matter how gravely they injure man<br>or society.</p>
<p>Let me give you one more example of the harm done by technological<br>interference. Today we have new technologies for the destruction of insect<br>pests and weeds. Their use is profitable for the manufacturers of pesticides<br>and weed killers; it is helpful to farmers who are able to get better crops,<br>reduce human labor, and produce at greater profit; it benefits consumers<br>who are offered a wider variety of food at less cost. Here is a classic case<br>to what technology can do for us. Unfortunately, we have left out of<br>consideration the balance of nature. If used improperly, these pesticides<br>and weed killers poison soil, crops, birds, animals, fish, and eventually<br>man. In her book Silent Spring, Rachel Carson spoke out eloquently |<br>against committing this ecological sin.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Ecologists constantly warn us that when the balance of nature is</p>
<p>upset, everything in nature is threatened, including man himself. It<br>seems certain that, unless he sets limits to his destructive instinct, man<br>will ultimately exterminate all wild life. He will then be left alone on</p>
<p>earth with his domesticated animals and with swarms of insects and</p>
<p>germs; alone in a world he has fashioned in the image of his technology.<br>The examples I have given show that to make technology safe, we<br>must have protective laws; that enactment of such laws depends upon a<br>humanistic attitude toward technology on the part of significant segments<br>of the public and its leaders. But more is needed. Law and public<br>opinion nearly always lag behind the swift development of new technologies.<br>Therefore, what is additionally needed is more informed and responsible<br>thinking among those who manage technologies. This can best be brought<br>about by professionalizing the decision-making process in technology.<br>Experience has shown that, in the hands of professional persons, technology<br>is managed with greater concern for human welfare than when it is controlled,<br>as at present, by nonprofessionals. The classic example is medicine.<br>Of all technologies, that of the physician has benefited man most<br>and harmed him least. The stringent standards set by the profession<br>and by society for the education and professional conduct of physicians<br>accounts for this happy circumstance. Not only is no one permitted to<br>practice who has not given proof of his competence, but physicians must<br>also be broadly, liberally, humanistically educated men and women.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>This gives them perspective in evaluating their professional actions, an</p>
<p>ability to see these actions against a humanistic background. Moreover,<br>they operate under a code of ethics which requires them to place the<br>needs of patients above all other considerations.</p>
<p>We owe to Greece the noble idea that special knowledge and skill<br>ought to be used humanistically, instead of merely for personal<br>aggrandizement or power, or as a means of extracting maximum gain<br>from those in need of the services of men possessing special expertise.<br>Yet this precept is rarely followed outside medicine and a few other<br>&quot;learned&quot; or liberal professions. Most human affairs are conducted<br>on the old Roman maxim of caveat emptor.</p>
<p>I have long believed that we should come appreciably closer to a<br>humanistic technology if engineering were practiced as a humanistic<br>profession and if, in consequence, engineers were accorded the<br>professional independence granted members of liberal professions. I<br>feel certain engineers would then find it possible to act with the same<br>sense of professional responsibility and service to humanity that is<br>characteristic of good physicians,</p>
<p>The role of the professional man is to lend his special knowledge,<br>his well-trained intellect, his dispassionate habit of visualizing problems<br>in terms of fundamental principles to whatever specific task is entrusted<br>to him. Professional independence is not a special privilege but rather</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>an inner necessity for the true professional man; it is a Safeguard</p>
<p>for his employer and for the public as well, It is what Chiefly sets<br>him apart from the skilled technician.</p>
<p>This independence of professional judgment has not yet been<br>accorded the engineer, He still has to win it for himself, Even<br>within the same organization, it may happen that the most experienced<br>engineer&#x27;s professional judgment will be Overruled by a lay superior,<br>while no one would think of dictating to a physician, no matter how<br>young and inexperienced he might be. Yet the university-trained<br>engineer is as competent a professional in his field as is the physician.<br>The difference lies in the determination of the medical profession to<br>resist lay interference and its success in winning this point, while<br>the engineering profession has Shown little determination and therefore<br>has had little success,</p>
<p>I speak of this with feeling, As you know, my work is in one of<br>the new technologies; one that is dangerous unless properly handled.<br>Iam frequently faced with the difficulty of convincing administrative<br>superiors that it is not safe for them to overrule their technical experts.<br>Here is a case in point:</p>
<p>A superior once asked me to reduce radiation Shielding in our<br>nuclear submarines. He said the advantage of getting a lighter-weight<br>reactor plant was worth risking the health of personnel, It was not</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>possible to make him see that such a concept could not be accepted;</p>
<p>that, moreover, where radiation is involved, we are dealing not just<br>with the lives of present day individuals but with the genetic future of<br>all mankind. His attitude was that we did not know much about<br>evolution and, if we raised radiation exposures, we might find the<br>resulting mutations to be beneficial—-that mankind might &quot;learn to<br>live with radiation. &#x27;&#x27; As you may surmise, I did not reduce the<br>thickness of the shielding.</p>
<p>How we use technology affects profoundly the shape of our society.<br>In the brief span of time—a century or so—that we have had a science-<br>based technology, what use have we made of it? We have multiplied<br>inordinately, wasted irreplaceable fuels and minerals and perpetrated<br>incalculable and irreversible ecological harm. I have thought much<br>about this, and I can find no evidence that man contributes anything to<br>the balance of nature-—anything at all. On the strength of his knowledge<br>of nature, he sets himself above nature; he presumes to change the<br>natural environment for all the living creatures on this earth. Do we,<br>who are transients and not overly wise, really believe we have the right<br>to upset the order of nature, an order established by a power higher<br>than man ?</p>
<p>These are complicated matters for ordinary citizens to evaluate<br>and decide. How, in future, to make wiser use of technology is perhaps</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>the paramount public issue facing electorates in all industrial democracies;</p>
<p>a problem difficult enough in itself but rendered still more so by the<br>strategies of those who wish to continue using harmful technologies.</p>
<p>It cannot be said too often that government has as much a duty to<br>protect the land, the air, the water, the natural environment of man<br>against such damage, as it has to protect the country against foreign<br>enemies and the individual against criminals; conversely, that every<br>citizen is duty bound to make an effort to understand how technology<br>operates and what are its possibilities and limitations. All this is<br>necessary if technology is to be assigned its proper place in human<br>affairs, if it is to be made humanistic.</p>
<p>A free society centers on man. It gives paramount consideration<br>to human rights, interests, and needs. But once ordinary citizens<br>come to feel that public issues are beyond their comprehension, a<br>pattern of life may develop where technology, not man, would become<br>central to the purpose of society. If we permit this to happen, the<br>human liberties for which mankind has fought, at so great a cost of</p>
<p>effort and sacrifice, will be extinguished.</p>
