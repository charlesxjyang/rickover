He warns that despite material abundance, this path has led to &quot;poisoned water, air, and soil; depleted resources; [and] overcrowding,&quot; positing that the &quot;last clear chance&quot; to avert catastrophe is imminent. Emphasizing that &quot;thinking makes it so&quot; whether technology is beneficial, Rickover stresses the distinction between science (knowledge) and technology (action), advocating for ecology—a science he suggests teaching from an early age—as the critical guide to direct technology towards &quot;humane ends.&quot; He concludes with a stark warning that without this humanistic approach, societal liberties could be extinguished.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Remarks by Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy at the 1969 Convention of the Mississippi Manufacturers Association, Biloxi, Mississippi, Friday, October 10, 1969</p>
<p>I am honored to be here in the home territory of my good friend, Senator Stennis, and to speak to his many friends. I should like first to pay tribute to him and to the members of the Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. As a senior member of both these Committees, he reviews all programs that have to do with national defense. I speak from personal experience when I say that without the support he and members of these Committees have unfailingly given to the Navy, conversion of our fleet to atomic energy would have been delayed, and might have come too late to be of use to the United States.</p>
<p>We now have a nuclear fleet of 85 attack and Polaris submarines, a small submarine capable of exploring the ocean bottom, a nuclear aircraft carrier, a cruiser, and two destroyers. In addition, we have under construction 21 attack submarines, a second aircraft carrier, and two frigates. Much credit for this must be given to Senator Stennis and to his colleagues.</p>
<p>The Senator, as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and member of the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, is exceptionally well-informed of all developments in military and space matters. As a member of the Special Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency he is one of seven senators who regularly receive highly classified briefings on the world situation. And, as a ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Education and Welfare he is influential in educational programs to better our nation and our youth. In all he does, he exercises the highest degree of integrity and patriotism.</p>
<p>Senator Stennis has constantly and wholeheartedly supported the Naval Reactors Program and devoted much time and effort to helping us. It is a comfort to be able to go to him for his wisdom, his objectivity, and kindly advice.</p>
<p>When he ran for the Senate in 1947, the Senator promised to "plow a straight furrow right down to the end of my row." His furrow has always been arrow straight.</p>
<p>I am proud to be associated with so fine a gentleman and patriot who does such honor to his native state.</p>
<p>May I add that Congressman William M. Colmer has asked that I give you his best wishes. As Chairman of the House Rules Committee he is one of the most influential members of Congress. He has helped immeasurably in making our nuclear navy possible. He is an experienced and hardworking representative from your state. You are indeed fortunate to have him represent you in Washington.</p>
<p>Now to the topic of my speech: A HUMANISTIC TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>My subject tonight is of utmost importance and great urgency--nothing less than keeping our small crowded planet habitable. If I may use a legal expression, the "last clear chance" to avert catastrophe may soon be upon us. We have been brought to this critical situation by the scientific-technological revolution, and we can extricate ourselves only by a change of direction in thought and action so drastic it would rate the term counterrevolutionary.</p>
<p>To the historian, this is a familiar sequence of events. During revolutions--social, political, technical--long established patterns of living are swiftly and radically altered by concentration on the attainment of a single objective, without regard to cost. Eventually the cost is revealed, and if it is too high, there is a counterrevolution. But this takes time, perhaps more than is available to us. Few laymen, as yet, have any conception of the true price we pay for the marvels of technology, although the mass media are now full of stories of poisoned water, air, and soil; of depleted resources and of overcrowding--all clearly among its adverse effects, all crying out for remedial action.</p>
<p>What chiefly delays public recognition of the costs of the scientific-technological revolution is, I submit, the universal popularity of its objective: material abundance, and an easing of man's earthly lot through mastery of nature, the "empire of man over nature" of which Francis Bacon dreamed three and a half centuries ago. Modern technology, solidly based on accurate scientific knowledge, comes remarkably close to this goal. Even the poorest in technically advanced countries are better fed, housed, and clothed; work in safer, more comfortable surroundings; enjoy greater leisure and more varied entertainments; live longer and healthier lives, than they could ever hope for in the vast backward regions of the earth. This accounts for what W. H. Ferry calls the "stupid love affair" of the general public with technology. "Breaking up the love affair," he said, "does not mean abandoning technology, but replacing infatuation with an understanding of its toxic qualities, and finding ways to direct it to humane ends."</p>
<p>Fortunately we have a means to such an understanding in ecology--a science conterminous with modern technology.</p>
<p>Derived from the Greek oikos, meaning household or living place, ecology deals with the interrelationships of plants and animals (including man), and their environment. Ecology, until recently a modest academic discipline chiefly serving agriculture and medicine, is destined to become the key science for correctly assessing the negative aspects of technology. In my opinion, ecology should be included in the curriculum of our schools. In this connection, I should like to make two suggestions: First, limit the study to plant and animal ecology, which is a fully developed branch of the exact sciences, omitting for the time being what goes under the name of social ecology. We tend in this country to try to do two or more things simultaneously. In consequence we do neither of them as well as we might. Second, consider the possibility of beginning the study at an early age. During a visit to Switzerland for the purpose of familiarizing myself with their educational system, I was much impressed by the way ecology was taught in a one-room village schoolhouse. It was part of the curriculum throughout the primary grades, being presented at first very simply--but always graphically; later, on a more complex level; and always alongside the three R's, and history, and government, so that the children absorb it as part of their general education.</p>
<p>What needs to be developed at the earliest opportunity is a habit of thinking ecologically, of being thoroughly familiar with the balance of nature, which Barry Commoner, the biologist, recently defined in simple words comprehensible to the nonscientist, old or young. All living things, he said, "are dependent on the great interwoven cyclical processes, followed by the four elements that make up the major portion of living things and the environment: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. All of these cycles are driven by the action of living things." Green plants convert carbon dioxide into food, fiber, and fuel, and produce the oxygen in the atmosphere. Animals, living basically on plant-produced food, regenerate the inorganic materials: carbon dioxide, nitrates, and phosphates--all of which support plant life. This vast web of biological interactions "makes up a huge, enormously complex living machine--the ecosphere--and on the integrity and proper functioning of that machine depends every human activity, including technology. . . . If we destroy it, our most advanced technology will come to naught and any economic and political system which depends on it will founder."</p>
<p>I wonder, too, whether ecology, properly presented at the higher secondary school levels, might not help dissipate the tendency in contemporary thinking of regarding technology as an irresistible force with a momentum of its own, that puts it beyond human direction and restraint. Mere awareness of all the adverse effects of technology may not suffice to mobilize public support for countervailing measures. What is additionally needed is a change of attitude on the part of the public and of its leaders. That is, of the prevailing concepts of what technology is, and what purpose it should serve. Only when viewed humanistically--in other words, as a means to human ends--can technology be made to produce maximum benefit, and do minimum harm to human beings, and to the values that make for civilized living. It may even enable man to become more truly human than it has ever been possible for him to be. Of technology it can rightly be said that it is not "either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."</p>
<p>Technology has been defined as that which covers "the field of how things are commonly done or made" and "what things are done or made." It is tools, techniques, procedures: the artifacts and processes fashioned by modern industrial man to increase his powers of mind and body. Marvelous they are, but let us not be overawed by these man-made things. Certainly, they themselves do not dictate how we should use them, nor, by their mere existence, do they authorize actions that were not anteriorly lawful. We alone bear responsibility for our technology. In this, as in all our actions, we are bound by the principles governing human behavior in our society. Ethics, I need hardly say, are not only personal; they are social as well.</p>
<p>This surely must be obvious to any reasonable man. Yet it cannot be overemphasized, for a considerable body of opinion propagates what comes close to being the opposite view. The notion is widespread that, having wrought vast changes in the material conditions of life, technology perforce renders obsolete traditional concepts of ethics and morals, as well as accustomed ways of arranging political and social relationships. Earnest debates are currently taking place as to whether it is possible to act morally in the new technological society, and proposals have been made--quite seriously--that science must now replace traditional ethics! We have here a confusion of means with ends that should be cleared up.</p>
<p>The laws disclosed by science must of course be heeded by those who wish to exploit scientific discoveries. In his technological activities man is bound by the laws of science. But it does not follow that he is bound by the laws of science in his purely human relations as well. "Science," wrote Vannevar Bush, "has come a long way in delineating the probable nature of the universe that surrounds us; of the physical world in which we live; of our own structure; our physical and chemical nature. It even enters into the mechanism by which the brain itself operates. Then it comes to the question of consciousness and free will--and there it stops. No longer can science prove, or even bear evidence. Those who base their personal philosophies or their religion upon science are left, beyond that point, without support."</p>
<p>Through technology man has been relieved of much brutal, exhausting, physical labor, as well as of boring routine work. He has been provided with numerous mechanical slaves who do certain kinds of work faster, cheaper and more efficiently than people. Why should the ease and affluence made possible by technology affect precepts that have guided western man for centuries? This may brand me as old-fashioned, but I have not yet found occasion to discard a single principle that was accepted in the America of my youth. Why should anyone feel in need of a new ethical code because he is healthier, or has more possessions, or more leisure? Does it make sense to abandon rules one has lived by because he has acquired better tools for doing his work?</p>
<p>Tools are for utilizing the external resources at our disposal. Principles are for marshaling our inner, our human resources. With tools we alter our physical environment; with principles we order our personal life and our relations with others. The two have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>It disturbs me to be told that technology "demands" an action the speaker favors, that "you can't stop progress." It troubles me, that we are so easily pressured by purveyors of technology into permitting so-called "progress" to alter our lives, without attempting to control it--as if technology were an irrepressible force of nature to which we must meekly submit. If we reflected, we might discover that not everything hailed as progress contributes to happiness; that the new is not always better, nor the old always outdated.</p>
