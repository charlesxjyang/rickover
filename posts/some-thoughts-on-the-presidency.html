      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this insightful reflection on the American Presidency, Admiral Hyman Rickover, who served under twelve Presidents from Truman to Reagan, highlights the profound isolation and challenges faced by a President, underscoring the critical need for candid, goal-oriented subordinates and diverse counsel, citing figures like Machiavelli, General Marshall, and Churchill. Rickover critiques the pervasive influence of media (post-1974), demanding total disclosure and hindering candid discussion, and warns against the sway of big business and the short-sighted nature of polls. He also draws attention to long-standing issues like the energy crisis, first warned of in the 1952 &quot;Resources for Freedom&quot; report, and the increasing difficulty of the Presidency due to Congressional gridlock. Ultimately, Rickover advocates for the President to act as a moral leader focused on historical legacy rather than popularity or a second term, emphasizing adherence to principle and conscience over political expediency, and reminding readers of the foundational principles from the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Preamble.</p>

        <p>Admiral Rickover has served the United States since 1918<br>when he took his oath of office as a midshipman at the Naval<br>Academy. President Carter is the twelfth President under whom<br>Admiral Rickover has served. He has met and talked with Presi-<br>dents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter,<br>and Reagan. From his personal observation, conversations, and<br>study, Admiral Rickover has written these thoughts about the<br>Presidency:</p>
<p>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE PRESIDENCY</p>
<p>A President will never hear the truth again. Everybody in<br>‘igh places stands in a room full of mirrors and sees himself<br>multiplied by servile reflection. The Oval Office can easily<br>become such a room.</p>
<p>Machiavelli said: &quot;The first opinion which one forms of a<br>prince and of his understanding is by observing the men he has<br>around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always<br>be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the<br>capable and to keep them faithful.&quot;</p>
<p>God governs Heaven without counsel, but rulers are men, and<br>all men need counsel.</p>
<p>If a question gets as high as the President, it is likely</p>
<p>to be insoluble anyway.</p>
<p>THE STAFF</p>
<p>In the inner councils of the White House the presence of<br>the President alters other men&#x27;s words. Some wait to hear what<br>he says, then agree. Others are intimidated and do not say what</p>
<p>is on their minds.</p>
<p>&gt; a — a i</p>
<p>Subordinates are needed who are committed to goals rather<br>than to the process, and who are not afraid to criticize when<br>they no longer agree with the goals.</p>
<p>When inviting Dean Acheson to be Under-Secretary of State,<br>General Marshall told him he would expect from him complete and<br>even brutal candor, without regard for personal feelings: &quot;y<br>have no feelings,&#x27;’ Marshall said, &quot;except those which are re-<br>served for Mrs. Marshall.&quot;</p>
<p>What is required is someone to disturb self-assurance of<br>a staff; someone who will say: &quot;We are getting into a mess!&quot;</p>
<p>It is essential to have an alternative to the official<br>version of things; a rival account of reality, a measure by<br>which to judge the efficacy of officials.</p>
<p>Those outside the inner circle who have your ear but who<br>seldom see fit to question your judgment should also be listened<br>to. Their judgment is what is needed to balance the parochial<br>judgment of your immediate staff, and they should be given a<br>hearing. &quot;The prince often gets to hear what he wants to hear.&quot;<br>The atmosphere then becomes that of a court.</p>
<p>One should not discourage interruption of the smooth<br>running of the machinery of the White House, and rely only on<br>those who can stay &quot;cool under pressure&quot;.</p>
<p>What Czar Nicholas I said, “Not I but 10,000 clerks rule</p>
<p>Russia,&quot; should be remembered.</p>
<p>The important officials affected by a decision should be<br>present and heard when the decision is being discussed. There-<br>fore, the decision should be in writing and communicated to all<br>concerned. The result is a trusted and respected President and<br>administrator.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things for a man is to remove<br>those who have started with him and who have been loyal to him.<br>But the need for removing some men occurs at all times. This<br>is difficult if they are the first incumbents, particularly if<br>they assisted him to achieve office.</p>
<p>When Churchill lost confidence in a subordinate, he removed<br>or assigned him another job. But when there was disagreement<br>with an adviser in whom he retained confidence, however violent<br>the clash of opinion, he gave way. In such circumstances he<br>never overrode technical advice, or undermined the man who gave it.</p>
<p>The President is, in reality, the trustee for the welfare<br>of the State. In this sense he must treat his subordinates in<br>an impersonal manner. He must be loyal only to those who are<br>loyal to his goals, not to their own.</p>
<p>That man who retains subordinates who cannot properly fulfill</p>
<p>their duties, sins both against God and against the State.</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>PRIVATE LIVES</p>
<p>I have always made known to those who worked with me that<br>I would not pry into their private lives, nor require social<br>relationships with them; whatever they did in their private<br>lives was entirely their affair, provided this did not reflect<br>unfavorably on the organization.</p>
<p>Staff members should be as anonymous as possible; they<br>should shun publicity except insofar as it adds to the stature<br>and prestige of their leader and his policies.</p>
<p>They must understand they are trustees for the organization;<br>that anything adverse that comes to public attention can reflect</p>
<p>not only on them but also on their leader.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT</p>
<p>The President should try for a place in history rather than<br>for a second tern.</p>
<p>Those who are ambitious to make a place and a name for then-<br>selves are nearly always despised and laughed at by lesser souls,<br>and what they do is construed as wrong.</p>
<p>History has the tendency to overlook the faults of men who<br>mattered, just as contemporaries overlook the contributions of<br>men who fail while daring greatly.</p>
<p>Few rulers we now account great, were great or popular in<br>the eyes of contemporaries; the few who were, were admired for</p>
<p>reasons which are not ours.</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>A President has been assigned much authority, yet little<br>power. Power is something acquired, something earned, some-<br>thing developed by an individual&#x27;s personality and accomplish-<br>ments. Authority is no match for it,</p>
<p>The most influential leaders are askers of questions, like<br>Socrates and Jesus.</p>
<p>Sweeping and simple views are useful only to those who do<br>not have responsibility.</p>
<p>True leaders look to reason, not to power.</p>
<p>To adhere to one&#x27;s first principles is not always correct.<br>Principles change with maturity.</p>
<p>It is only the ignorant who attribute the doings of the<br>government to the person of its Head—like the yokel who believed<br>that the Crimean War was ended only when the English Queen captured<br>the Russian Czar. ;</p>
<p>People do not notice the existence of the best leaders.</p>
<p>When such a leader&#x27;s work is done, they say, &quot;We did it ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>The test of political leadership is not whether the leader<br>has his way; it is whether he makes the most of the existing<br>materials he has to work with, and whether he creates new materials<br>to help him meet his goals.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to attempt to appear as the sort of person<br>one thinks should be the leader, rather than being himself.</p>
<p>It 1s sometimes necessary at the top of authority to bear<br>with disloyal colleagues, to remain calm when others panic, and</p>
<p>to withstand misguided popular outcries.</p>

<p>It is not a credit to have been right when others have been<br>wrong; but this has always been the consolation of dedicated men.</p>
<p>The willingness to reassess and move beyond an earlier<br>formulation is precisely what makes one&#x27;s actions a model. This<br>testifies to the ability to outgrow parochialism, to move beyond<br>the starting point, to give up the comfort of having a fixed position.</p>
<p>At the very moment when the decision on a basic issue must<br>be made and there is no one to whom you can refer, that is when<br>the full weight of the responsibility of leadership is felt.</p>
<p>When one has responsibility, silence or inaction is also an<br>act—an act of irresolution which can lead to loss of power. Your<br>Situation will be no worse, nor will you find yourself in less<br>credit, had you acted and lost.</p>
<p>In most democracies, the leaders of fixed principle have now<br>departed, leaving their standards to flexible pragmatists pre-<br>occupied with the discovery of &quot;consensus&quot;, and survival through<br>use of the alluring but dangerous doctrine that a leader can serve<br>a people well by reflecting them.</p>
<p>If you are called a kind President, your rule is a failure.</p>
<p>THE MEDIA</p>
<p>In the democratic process we must have leaders, not rulers,<br>even if the quality of that leadership is not perfect in the eyes<br>of the omni-present media. To demand a perfect leader or a perfect</p>
<p>society is to give up choosing between better and worse. If the</p>
<p>imperfect is defined as evil, then everything becomes evil, since</p>
<p>everything is imperfect. The fundamental difference between<br>better and worse has not changed over the years; what has changed<br>is the manner in which the better is ignored and the worse re-<br>ported incessantly.</p>
<p>Since the events of 1974, the media has been demanding<br>total disclosure from our leaders. The illusion has been created<br>that a cloud of secrecy has bee» thrown over every act of govern-<br>ment to hide dark motives. But not all secrets are evil. The<br>drafting of sensible policies requires candid speech, because<br>only in this way can leaders fully explore various alternatives.<br>Confidentiality is often essential to candor. Otherwise nothing<br>is achieved as rival factions seek media support before a de-<br>cision is reached.</p>
<p>The framing of our Constitution illustrates this point. Not<br>only was the press barred entirely from all meetings, but also<br>each delegate had to pledge to preserve confidentiality of the<br>discussions. Without obedience to that fundamental rule, the<br>great compromises that lie at the heart of the Constitution&#x27;s<br>success could never have been achieved. Once agreement was<br>reached, public disclosure of the result and debate properly<br>followed.</p>
<p>No man can be a hero to his valet, since the valet&#x27;s duties<br>make him see his employer at his most undignified. The news<br>business now seeks the intimacy of the valet. The media peers<br>at you from all angles and at all hours of the day and night; it</p>
<p>desires to record all human frailties.</p>
<p>All of us have contradictory elements in our character; it</p>
<p>is only when a man becomes eminent that the contradictions become<br>conspicuous.</p>
<p>It is easier to point to the flaws and fallibilities of a<br>great man than to be one.<br>If you think someone is telling a lie about you, the only</p>
<p>way to answer is with the whole truth.</p>
<p>POLLS</p>
<p>Polls are ephemeral judgments for specific times and for<br>specific acts; they are quickly forgotten. A man will ultimately<br>be judged by his overall accomplishments, not by a single item<br>or error in judgment. The vast majority rarely remember what</p>
<p>was in yesterday&#x27;s paper or on television.</p>
<p>ADVOCACY OF FREEDOM ABROAD</p>
<p>The United States, from its inception, has been looked upon<br>by people all over the world as the leading exponent of human<br>freedom. This is still a worthy cause, regardless of what other<br>international objectives we may have. Our country is the shining<br>light for all oppressed people. No other country is held in such<br>high regard universally in this respect.</p>
<p>For example, in 1911, President William Howard Taft rebuked the<br>Russian Government when it charged and imprisoned a Jewish citizen for<br>the alleged ritual murder of a child. This was the Mendel Beilis</p>
<p>affair. Beilis was eventually freed.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>BIG BUSINESS</p>
<p>The United States, through Congress and through some govern-<br>ment officials, is being influenced by big business to a greater<br>extent than ever before in our history. This is done through<br>extensive and increasing lobbying, and by various types of con-<br>tributions and campaign funds. It is important that appropriate<br>legislation be enacted to limit this.</p>
<p>Those at the head of Government Departments, and their sub-<br>ordinates, can reach fantastic heights of hallucination. They<br>have been encouraged by the almost universal acquiescence of<br>ordinary people, whose penchant for self-deception is great and<br>deep. Government officials and military officers—particularly<br>the higher ones—are prone to vocational inflation and seif-<br>deception.</p>
<p>What determines the immediate course of events is not<br>theories or good intentions, but the character of the men in<br>authority. Having been a success in business, does not guarantee<br>this. Government is far more difficult than business; it generally<br>requires different qualities.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that men who come into Government<br>from industry, work entirely for the best interests of the Govern-<br>ment , not for the interests of the companies that have contracts<br>with the Government. I have frequently seen this in the actions<br>of some of these officials. When they were in business, they did</p>
<p>all possible to protect their own company. Once in Government, -</p>
<p>they become arbiters between the Government and business, and<br>take extra-legal actions. At times they give way to &quot;responsible<br>defeatism&quot;.</p>
<p>To the contrary, they should just as avidly protect the<br>Government—the one who employs them-—as they previously pro-<br>tected their own business. They justify their actions by<br>claiming they are acting for the overall benefit of the United<br>States. But this is the function of Congress, not of appointed _<br>officials; these should execute the law. :<br>To maintain the legitimacy of government requires that</p>
<p>public officials act like servants of the people, not like kings.</p>
<p>ENERGY</p>
<p>Until the end of World War II, the United States had nearly<br>adequate natural resources to take care of all our people, and<br>much extra for export. Volume 3 - &quot;The Outlook for Energy Re-<br>sources&quot; - of the 1952 Resources for Freedom, a report to the<br>President, gave early warning of the energy crisis. But hardly<br>any attention was given to it by the press or by the public.<br>Warnings by myself and others to Congress had no effect.</p>
<p>Today, this situation has caught up with us. Henceforth,<br>we will be in constant difficulty. The energy situation, in<br>particular, is the harbinger. No matter how much we try, how<br>much money we spend, we may be deluding ourselves that we will<br>find a large and cheap new energy source. Instead, we may have</p>
<p>to depend largely on coal and wood.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>I envision that, sooner or later, this will require us to</p>
<p>restructure our way of life. Many will have to be moved from<br>rural areas and suburbs into cities and large towns.</p>
<p>Housing will have to be built in such manner as to service<br>large numbers of people to minimize use of energy. Transporta-<br>tion will have to be modified to achieve this. Railroad systems<br>especially will have to be modernized and expanded. Travel and<br>shipment of goods will, to a far greater extent, have to be by<br>rail than by oil-consuming means.</p>
<p>It is essential that planning and action start now, while<br>we still have time. The grave nature of this crisis must be<br>constantly reiterated. This is an unpopular theme because the<br>vast majority of our people still live in an environment where<br>energy is readily available.</p>
<p>Might it not be wise to start now planting fast-growing<br>trees wherever possible? Would it not be far-sighted national</p>
<p>wisdom to use our unemployed to rebuild our cities and plant trees?</p>
<p>THE PRESENT NATURE OF THE OFFICE</p>
<p>Few individuals have the ability to recognize a developing<br>situation. Leaders are nearly always attuned to solving today&#x27;s<br>problems. Some Members of Congress are attuned to seeking re-<br>election and tend to avoid issues that conflict with this. Even<br>when an issue is clearly seen by Congress and the people, there<br>is no assurance of its solution. There is the attitude: &quot;If we<br>can land on the moon, we can do anything.&quot; Few realize that there</p>
<p>was no opposition to this venture; that it required only the ex-</p>
<p>pansion of existing technology.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>The only effective place where such issues can properly be<br>considered is the Presidency.</p>
<p>If war broke out during a President&#x27;s incumbency, his<br>situation would be drastically improved. All local and parochial<br>interests would be subordinated to waging it.</p>
<p>I doubt Abraham Lincoln would be considered a great President<br>were it not for the Civil War. And I doubt that, other than<br>George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin<br>Roosevelt, any previous President would be considered &quot;great&quot;.</p>
<p>The Presidency today is the most difficult one in our history.<br>Further, I believe the next Presidency, and the ones succeeding<br>it, will be successively more difficult—unless a war or other</p>
<p>great crisis intervenes.</p>
<p>FUNCTION OF THE PRESIDENCY</p>
<p>Since Congress is not today amenable to the desires of the<br>President, and since &quot;Congressional government&quot; has, in the main,<br>become government by pressure groups, cooperation can only be<br>obtained by largely acquiesing in measures which serve the in-<br>dividual interests of one or more of its Members. These interests<br>may not necessarily be ultimately best for the United States. A<br>President, therefore, can follow one of two courses:</p>
<p>a. Decide that certain objectives are so overridingly im-<br>portant that he will compromise or give away other &quot;goods&quot; that</p>
<p>will not unduly hurt the United States.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>b. Act as the moral leader of the country, advocating<br>those items he believes in, regardless of Congress, the media,<br>or polls.</p>
<p>The office is a superb opportunity for applying, in new<br>conditions, the simple rules of human conduct to which we always<br>revert.</p>
<p>He can then say, as did Martin Luther, &quot;Here I stand, I<br>cannot do otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>The Presidency is not merely an administrative office; it<br>is predominantly a place for moral leadership.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the second course is far the better because<br>it permits him to be a leader. He can then act the way he be-<br>lieves to be for the true interests of the country. More im-<br>portant, it enables him to act in a consistent manner—in ac-<br>cordance with principle and conscience.</p>
<p>If we think of happiness in its common human dimensions<br>rather than as an adventure in individual selfishness, the<br>limited things government can do to promote happiness become<br>clear. They are well stated in the Preamble to the Constitu-<br>tion-—&quot;“establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide<br>for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and</p>
<p>secure the blessings of liberty.&quot;</p>
