      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his July 22, 1978 remarks at the launching of the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Bremerton (SSN698) in Groton, Connecticut, Senator Henry M. Jackson emphasized the critical need for a strong U.S. Navy in the face of evolving global challenges. He lauded Admiral Hyman Rickover as the &quot;guiding spirit&quot; of the nuclear navy and noted a personal connection to the Bremerton, as its keel bore his wife Helen&#x27;s initials. Jackson highlighted the alarming growth of Soviet naval power and its &quot;expansionist mood&quot; across Africa, Afghanistan, Yemen, and South Asia, contrasting this with the U.S. fleet&#x27;s significant reduction to half its 1970 size and an inadequate shipbuilding program. Citing historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;speak softly and carry a big stick&quot; advice and Lord Robert Cecil, the Senator underscored the Navy&#x27;s vital role in safeguarding peace, ensuring freedom, maintaining sea lines of communication for Western economies, and supporting allies, concluding with a powerful quote from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>

<p>US. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington &amp; (202) 224-9378</p>
<p>FOR RELEASE: PM<br>Saturday, July 22, 1978</p>
<p>REMARKS BY SENATOR HENRY M. JACKSON</p>
<p>At the Launching of the Nuclear Powered<br>Attack Submarine BREMERTON (SSN698)</p>
<p>Groton, Connecticut<br>Saturday, July 22, 1978<br>11:00 A.M.</p>
<p>Two years and two months have passed since the Jackson family<br>had the pleasure of joining in the keel-laying ceremonies for the<br>U.S.S. BREMERTON. During that time, many things have changed on<br>land and at sea. But one thing is unaltered: Hyman Rickover is<br>still the guiding spirit of our nuclear navy! I am delighted to<br>have my old friend Admiral Rickover here with us today as we welcome</p>
<p>his latest contribution to the fleet.</p>
<p>It is an honor to be in Groton once more to take part in the<br>christening of the new BREMERTON. As you know, the Jacksons feel a<br>special attachment to this ship. She bears not only a proud Navy</p>
<p>name, a proud name from the State of Washington, but also, upon her</p>
<p>q keel, the initials of my wife, Helen.<br>You recall Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s famous advice in 1903: &quot;Speak<br>softly and carry a big stick.&quot; Did you know he was talking about</p>
<p>the need for a strong navy?</p>
<p>In that same speech he went on to advise the American Nation to</p>
<p>speak softly, &quot;and yet build and keep at a pitch of the highest</p>
<p>training, a thoroughly efficient navy.&quot;</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt was on the right track way back then. Deeds,</p>
<p>not words, are what really count.</p>
<p>As Lord Robert Cecil put it: &#x27;&quot;Vehemence of language falls<br>dead and impotent upon minds penetrated with the conviction that<br>the storm which is assailing them is nothing but words -- brave</p>
<p>words possibly, but still only words.&quot;</p>
<p>A strong, up-to-date Navy remains a fundamental requirement of</p>
<p>our national security.</p>
<p>Recent developments on the world scene emphasize this require-</p>
<p>ment:</p>
<p>* Soviet leaders are in an expansionist mood. They are on the<br>political offensive. In past probings, the strategic inferiority<br>of Soviet power and a restricted naval capacity has set definite<br>limits to the extent of the risks that Moscow was willing to run.<br>Today, with the strategic balance tilting in their favor and with<br>their growing naval forces, the Soviet leaders are accepting a more<br>extensive and dangerous range of risks in advancing their position.<br>The growing Soviet boldness is evident in a policy of military<br>adventure in Africa, coups in Afghanistan and Yemen, and provocative</p>
<p>moves in South Asia.</p>
<p>* The Western nations increasingly depend on foreign sources of</p>
<p>energy and raw materials. To a greater extent than ever before,</p>
<p>we rely on oil and other natural resources shipped across the oceans.<br>Disruption of these flows would have an immediate and devastating</p>
<p>effect upon Western economies.</p>
<p>* As the Soviet conventional threat has grown in Europe, the</p>
<p>credibility of the NATO deterrent increasingly depends on our ability<br>to keep the sea lines of communication open for massive, rapid</p>
<p>reinforcement of our allies in case of need.</p>
<p>* Long-standing American allies, including Japan, the Philippines<br>and South Korea, look to a strong U.S. naval presence in the Western<br>Pacific to support their independence. And we and the People&#x27;s<br>Republic of China share parallel interests in deterring Soviet</p>
<p>expansionism in the Pacific area.</p>
<p>* Meanwhile, we see a continued growth in Soviet naval power.<br>The Soviet Union now possesses the world&#x27;s largest Navy. A central<br>feature of its mission is the interdiction of Western sea lines</p>
<p>of communication.</p>
<p>A large, flexible, two-ocean American navy is essential in<br>the national interest. Yet, we are approaching the point where</p>
<p>our Navy is too small to perform vital missions.</p>
<p>Today our fleet is roughly one-half the size it was in 1970.<br>Through block obsolescence substantial numbers of World War II-<br>vintage ships have been only partially replaced by more capable,<br>more sophisticated, and much more costly vessels. Administration</p>
<p>after administration has reduced our five-year ship-building</p>
<p>program to the point where, this year, the President requested</p>
<p>for the construction of only fifteen ships. This building</p>
<p>program falls far short of what we need for the years ahead.</p>
<p>The Congress has moved to authorize a fourth Nimitz-class<br>carrier. This is the kind of determined signal the Soviets can<br>understand. The 13-carrier force of our Navy is the foundation for<br>our capability to support the NATO flanks, to maintain the freedom<br>of the seas and the supply lines to our friends and allies in<br>Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific, and to protect and assure<br>the sources and transportation of the free world&#x27;s oil supplies into</p>
<p>the next century.</p>
<p>This ship we launch today is, inseparable from the skilled Naval<br>personnel that will operate it. We must rigorously maintain the<br>high standards of excellence in training and in operating that have</p>
<p>been the special distinction of the nuclear fleet.</p>
<p>The BREMERTON, and her sister nuclear ships, will sail the<br>seas as a reminder that a sovereign America is determined to</p>
<p>safeguard the peace and to assure the future of freedom.<br>As Henry Wadsworth Longfellow put it:</p>
<p>&quot;Sail forth into the sea, O ship!</p>
<p>Through wind and wave, right onward steer?<br>Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State?</p>
<p>Sail on, O UNION, strong and great!<br>Humanity with all its fears,</p>
<p>With all the hopes of future years,</p>
<p>Is hanging breathless on thy fate!&quot;</p>
