      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this speech delivered at the Columbian Foundation in 1977, Admiral H.G. Rickover reflects on his prior acceptance of the &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; International Communications Award in Genoa, Italy, two decades earlier. He emphasizes that monumental engineering successes, such as the development of nuclear ship propulsion and the NAUTILUS, are not the sole achievement of one individual but rather the collective effort of an entire organization and an international &quot;honor roll&quot; of scientists, including figures like Enrico Fermi. Rickover asserts that no nation is self-sufficient in science or engineering, and that Western civilization, stemming from the Medieval Respublica Christiana, shares a deep, common heritage. He identifies the &quot;restless spirit of venturesome inquiry&quot;—the freedom to explore, experiment, and innovate despite resistance—as the most distinguishing and vital aspect of this civilization, advocating for its perpetual cultivation to ensure progress and prevent stagnation, and he presents Christopher Columbus as a prime example of this enduring spirit of perseverance and daring exploration.</p>

        <p>For release 8:00 p. M. (Edt) monday, october 10, 1977</p>
<p>Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Navy at the Columbian Foundation West Orange, New Jersey October 10, 1977</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, I received the ''Christopher Columbus'' International Communications Award in Genoa, Italy, in the presence of His Excellency, the President of Italy; His Eminence, the Cardinal of Milan; the United States Ambassador; the Mayor of Genoa; and other dignitaries.</p>
<p>I will tell you what I said then:</p>
<p>&quot;TJ am highly honored to have been chosen for this year's &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; Award which I gratefully accept on behalf of the Government and the Congress of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;In an engineering project such as that of developing nuclear ship propulsion, success is never due to the labors of a single man. There must, of course, be someone to direct; but success depends as much on the faithful work of everyone concerned in the project as on the man who</p>
<p>heads it. I feel strongly that the &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; Award belongs</p>
<p>jointly to all the men and women of my organization without whose stead-</p>
<p>fast devotion and hard work there would have been no NAUTILUS.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet even this group cannot truly claim credit for the development</p>
<p>of nuclear propulsion. Our work could not have been done without the</p>
<p>theoretical groundwork laid by many men from many lands—an international</p>
<p>honor roll of scientists trained in European and American universities, These men of diverse national origins laid the foundations of our present knowledge of nuclear fission; among them your own countryman of beloved memory—Enrico Fermi.</p>
<p>&quot;Truly, no country can claim national self-sufficiency in the fields of science and engineering. We each drink from the common pool and sometimes contribute a little to it.</p>
<p>&quot;It is often said in my country that the earliest English settlers who came to our shores brought with them the great body of English Common Law and Legal Procedure which remains the basis of American jurisprudence to this day. With equal justice, we can say that each European who followed Columbus across the Atlantic to found a new American family carried with him the great treasure of European civilization which today belongs to us of the New World as much as it does to you of the Old. That these men from every corner of Europe found it possible to live together in peace and to build a wtrong country with great internal cohesion is not surprising when we remember that what they had in common was so much more signi-</p>
<p>ficant than what divided them.</p>
<p>&quot;They had in common a thousand-year tradition of religious, moral,</p>
<p>social, and cultural unity, going back to Greece, the Roman Empire and the Medieval Respublica Christiana, For until the end of the Middle Ages, Europe had been as one in the fundamentals of life, in everything that is truly important. Educated men even spoke the same language.</p>
<p>&quot;Had there been a transportation congress in the days of Christopher Columbus, there would have been no need for instantaneous four-way translation service. We should all have conversed with ease in Latin, learned from the same textbooks, by the same teaching methods, in the same sort of grammar schools.</p>
<p>“Against this deep basic unity, what divided the European settlers who came to America was relatively unimportant—their separation by the political boundaries of the modern nation states. In the long span of European history these boundaries were of fairly recent origin, going back only to the 15th or 16th centuries when the sovereign states of Europe obtained their independence. The diversity of Europe was superimposed on her age-old unity. When the European settlers came to America the political barriers dividing them were left behind, and the ties of their</p>
<p>common European civilization reasserted themselves. Thus we have been</p>
<p>able to build a new civilization closely related to yours, if different in</p>
<p>some outward manifestations.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were asked to pick the one most significant aspect of our common Western civilization which most distinguishes it from other great cultures I should, I think, choose the freedom it accords the human spirit to inquire into the unknown, to experiment, to improve, and to change. It is this restless spirit of venturesome inquiry which has brought about the scientific and technical achievements of today.</p>
<p>&quot;Most men are conservative and resist unknown forces which threaten to upset the even tenor of accustomed ways of life. In some cultures this mental laziness has been elevated into a civic virtue. Tradition reigns supreme and the few of venturesome spirit are put into a straitjacket,</p>
<p>In the West, the venturous have never been wholly stifled by tradition, though at times inquiry was frowned upon by the authorities. Sooner or later, freedom to inquire re-established itself—not without opposition,</p>
<p>of course. Western men, too, cling to the familiar and accustomed; entrenched interests fight innovations threatening their privileges. No discovery is brought forth, no innovation is carried through without real effort and single-minded obstinacy. Everything new endangers something old. Anew machine replaces human hands; a new source of power threatens old businesses; a new trade route wipes out the supremacy of old ports and brings prosperity to new ones. This is the price which must be paid for progress and it is worth it. Let us never stifle man's urge to push outward</p>
<p>the boundaries of knowledge or Western civilization will stagnate »nd die.</p>
<p>''Among the great Europeans who have helped widen knowledge, few can equal Christopher Columbus in firmness of purpose, patient persis- tence in the face of petty obstruction and heartbreaking disappointments, and courage in the face of unknown danger. For ten long years he labored to win recognition and support for his daring project. All he needed was financial support; he, himself, took all the chances. Because he succeeded, we in America—as do you in Genoa—honor his name each year on the 12th of October. It is most fitting that Genoa should honor her illustrious son</p>
<p>by bringing together men from all corners of the world who labor in the field of transport and communications in which Columbus was the unrivaled pioneer. To receive the award granted in his name is a most heartwarming and gratifying event for an American.&quot;</p>
<p>Having finished repeating what I said in Genoa, I now thank the</p>
<p>Columbian Foundation for today's award.</p>
