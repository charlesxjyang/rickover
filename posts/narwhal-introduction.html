        <p>Introduction of The Honorable Chet Holifield U.S. House of Representatives Vice Admiral 4 Rickover, USN on the occasion of the Commissioning of USS NARWHAL (SSN671) U.S. eritamptnn Base New London, Connecticut July 12, 1969</p>
<p>Captain Matson, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Tt is a pleasure to introduce a great American, the Honorable Chet Holifield, Congressman from the 19th District of California and Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. I recall a cold and windy day three and one half years ago, January 17, 1966, when I introduced Chairman Holifield as he prepared to lay the keel of the NARWHAL. We are fortunate to have him with us again today for her commissioning.</p>
<p>During the intervening years the struggle to maintain a strong nuclear Navy has continued. As in the past, Mr. Holifield has been in the vanguard of those farsighted members of Congress dedicated to preserving our hard-won preeminence in this vital field. Without him, and others of his courage and wisdom, our Nation would be far less secure than it is today.</p>
<p>As we move into the future it should give all of us confidence to know that we can continue to rely on Chairman Holifield's leadership and dedication. This is true not only in the field of naval nuclear propulsion. It is also true in all of his far-reaching responsibilities as Chairman of the Joint</p>
<p>Committee on Atomic Energy.</p>
<p>Before giving the rostrum to Chairman Holifield, I am honored to recognize another distinguished American who has contributed immeasurably to our nuclear Navy~-the Honorable Craig Hosmer, Congressman from California's 32nd District. He is the senior Republican Congressman on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Had the Republicans won control of the House last November Mr. Hosmer would now be Chairman of the Committee and I know that he and Mr. Holifield would continue to work together 48 they have in the past. And I am pleased that his gracious and lovely lady could be here today.</p>
<p>I can assure you that members of the Joint Committee do not permit politics to influence their decisions in matters affecting national security.</p>
<p>It has been an inspiration and a privilege for me to serve in a common effort with these jllustrious citizens and statesmen who do 80 much honor to</p>
<p>their country and to their state.</p>
