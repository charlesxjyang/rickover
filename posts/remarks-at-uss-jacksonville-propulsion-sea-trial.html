      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document contains Admiral Rickover&#x27;s remarks on the successful first sea trials of the USS Jacksonville on January 26, 1981. Rickover expresses profound gratitude to the skilled workers who built the nuclear submarine, acknowledging the project took &quot;years longer than expected,&quot; and commends the ship&#x27;s crew and leadership, specifically Captain Yurso and Captain Wilkinson, for their outstanding performance under challenging circumstances. A central theme is the critical importance of high-quality, exacting work in shipbuilding, particularly for nuclear-powered submarines, a principle Rickover underscores by quoting the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who stated that &quot;shipbuilding and seafaring are exacting arts and must not be practiced casually.&quot; He further quotes the Apostle Paul from both the Epistles to the Galatians and Corinthians to inspire perseverance and highlight that diligent work will eventually be revealed and rewarded.</p>

        <p>26 JANUARY 1981</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER&#x27;S REMARKS ON THE<br>JACKSONVILLE SEA TRIALS</p>
<p>WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST SEA TRIALS OF THE JACKSONVILLE. THE<br>PROPULSION PLANT OPERATED SATISFACTORILY.</p>
<p>THE JACKSONVILLE IS FINALLY AN EXCELLENTLY BUILT SHIP. I WANT TO THANK</p>
<p>AND CONGRATULATE ALL OF THE SKILLED WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO BUILT THIS<br>SHIP.</p>
<p>THE JANUARY 8, 1981, ISSUE OF ELECTRIC BOAT TOPICS QUOTED THE GREEK<br>HISTORIAN THUCYDIDES, AS FOLLOWS:</p>
<p>&quot;SHIPBUILDING AND SEAFARING ARE EXACTING ARTS AND MUST NOT BE<br>PRACTICED CASUALLY.&quot;</p>
<p>AS I AM A STUDENT OF HISTORY, PARTICULARLY OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS, I WAS<br>GRATIFIED THAT ELECTRIC BOAT REFERRED TO THE ANCIENT GREEKS -- A PEOPLE I<br>GREATLY ADMIRE. I WAS PLEASED AND IMPRESSED THAT THERE ARE SOME AT<br>ELECTRIC BOAT WHO APPRECIATE THAT THE ANCIENT GREEKS CONDUCTED THEIR<br>SHIPBUILDING IN AN EXACTING MANNER.</p>
<p>THE NECESSITY OF HAVING HIGH QUALITY WORK IN SHIPBUILDING WAS<br>RECOGNIZED BY THE ANCIENT GREEKS. WHAT THUCYDIDES SAID IS EVEN MORE<br>IMPORTANT TODAY FOR NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINES.</p>
<p>BUILDING THE JACKSONVILLE HAS TAKEN YEARS LONGER THAN EXPECTED AND MUCH<br>LONGER THAT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN THOSE EXPERT SHIPBUILDERS - THE ANCIENT<br>GREEKS.</p>
<p>THE APOSTLE PAUL IN HIS EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS SAID:</p>
<p>&quot;AND LET US NOT BE WEARY IN WELL DOING: FOR IN DUE SEASON WE SHALL<br>REAP, IF WE FAINT NOT.&quot;</p>
<p>ALSO THE APOSTLE PAUL IN HIS FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS SAID:</p>
<p>&quot;EVERY MAN&#x27;S WORK SHALL BE MADE MANIFEST: FOR THE DAY SHALL DECLARE<br>IT, BECAUSE IT SHALL BE REVEALED BY FIRE; AND THE FIRE SHALL TRY MAN&#x27;S<br>WORK OF WHAT SORT IT IS.&quot;</p>
<p>WE WERE NOT ABLE TO HOLD FORMAL CHURCH SERVICES YESTERDAY. BUT I<br>BELIEVE THESE THOUGHTS MAY PROVIDE INSPIRATION FOR THE COMING WEEK.</p>
<p>ADMIRAL FOWLER, THE COMMANDER OF THE NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND, HAS<br>BEEN ABOARD TO WITNESS THESE TRIALS. ADMIRAL FOWLER AND I WANT ESPECIALLY<br>TO THANK THE SUPERVISOR OF SHIPBUILDING, CAPTAIN YURSO, WHO HAS WORKED HARD<br>AND WHO DESERVES MUCH CREDIT FOR BRINGING ABOUT THESE SUCCESSFUL TRIALS.<br>CAPTAIN YURSO IS DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>
<p>I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE CAPTAIN WILKINSON AND HIS OFFICERS AND MEN.<br>ALL OF YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB;<br>ALL OF YOU HANDLED THE SHIP LIKE VETERANS. I KNOW THAT YOU WILL ALL<br>CONTINUE TO PERFORM YOUR DUTIES IN THE VERY SAME OUTSTANDING MANNER. THE<br>NAVY AND OUR COUNTRY IS PROUD THAT IT HAS PRODUCED SO FINE A CREW.</p>
