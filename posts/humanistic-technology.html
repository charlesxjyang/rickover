      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman Rickover&#x27;s October 10, 1969 speech, &quot;A Humanistic Technology,&quot; opens by lauding Senator Stennis and Congressman William M. Colmer, crediting Stennis for the impressive growth of the nuclear navy, which by then included 85 submarines, a nuclear aircraft carrier, and other vessels. Rickover then pivots to the urgent need for a &quot;humanistic technology,&quot; critiquing society&#x27;s &quot;stupid love affair&quot; with unchecked technological advancement. He warns that despite material abundance, this path has led to &quot;poisoned water, air, and soil; depleted resources; [and] overcrowding,&quot; positing that the &quot;last clear chance&quot; to avert catastrophe is imminent. Emphasizing that &quot;thinking makes it so&quot; whether technology is beneficial, Rickover stresses the distinction between science (knowledge) and technology (action), advocating for ecology—a science he suggests teaching from an early age—as the critical guide to direct technology towards &quot;humane ends.&quot; He concludes with a stark warning that without this humanistic approach, societal liberties could be extinguished.</p>

<p>I am honored to be here in the home territory of my good friend,</p>
<p>Senator Stennis, and to speak to his many friends. I should like first</p>
<p>to pay tribute to nim and to the members of the Senate Armed Services</p>
<p>and Appropriations Committees. As a senior member of both these<br>Committees, he reviews all programs that have to do with national defense.<br>I speak from personal experience when I say that without the support he<br>and members of these Committees have unfailingly given to the Navy ,</p>
<p>| ‘eonversion of our fleet to atomic energy would have been delayed, and</p>
<p>might have come too late to be of use to the United States.</p>
<p>We now have a nuclear fleet of 85 attack and Polaris submarines, @<br>small submarine capable of exploring the ocean pottom, a nuclear aircraft<br>carrier, a cruiser, and two destroyers. In addition we have under</p>
<p>construction 21 attack submarines, a second aircraft carrier, and two</p>
<p>frigates. Much eredit for this must be given to Senator Stennis and to<br>his colleagues.</p>
<p>The Senator, as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and<br>member of the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, is exceptionally</p>
<p>well-informed of all developments in.military and space matters. As a</p>
<p>member of the Special Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency he is</p>
<p>one of seven senators who regularly receive highly classified briefings<br>on the world situation. And, as a ranking member of the Senate</p>
<p>ubcommittee on Labor, Health, Education and Welfare he is influential</p>
<p>ta</p>
<p>in educational programs to better our nation and our youth. In all he<br>does he exercises the highest degree of integrity and patriotism.</p>
<p>Senator Stennis has constantly and wholeheartedly supported the<br>Naval Reactors Program and devoted much time and effort to helping us.<br>It is a comfort to be able to go to him for his wisdom, his objectivity,<br>and kindly advice.</p>
<p>When he ran for the Senate in 1947, the Senator promised to &quot;plow<br>a straight furrow right down to the end of my row.&quot; His furrow has<br>always been arrow straight.</p>
<p>I am proud to be associated with so fine a gentleman and patriot</p>
<p>who does such honor to his native state.</p>
<p>May I add that Congressman William M. Colmer has asked that I give<br>you his best wishes. As Chairman of the House Rules Committee he is<br>one of the most influential members of Congress. He has helped<br>4mmeasurably in making our nuclear navy possible. He is an/ experienced<br>and hardworking representative from your state. You are indeed</p>
<p>fortunate to have him represent you in Washington.</p>

<p>A HUMANISTIC TECHNOLOGY</p>

<p>Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy</p>
<p>at the<br>1969 Convention</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>Mississippi Manufacturers Association</p>
<p>Biloxi, Mississippi<br>Friday, dctober 10, 1969</p>
<p>My subject tonight is of utmost importance and great urgency--nothing<br>less than keeping our small crowded planet habitable. If I may use a<br>legal expression, the &quot;last clear chance&quot; to avert catastrophe may soon<br>be upon us. We have been brought to this critical situation by the<br>scientific-technological revolution, and,can extricate ourselves only by<br>a change of direction in thought and action so drastic it would rate the<br>term counterrevolutionary.</p>
<p>To the historian, this is a familiar sequence of events. During<br>revolutions--social, political, technical--long established patterns of<br>living are swiftly and radically altered by concentration on the<br>attainment of a single objective, without regard to cost. Eventually the<br>cost is revealed and if it is too high, there is a counterrevolution.</p>
<p>But this takes time, perhaps more than is available to us. Few laymen,</p>
<p>as yet, have any conception of the true price we pay for the marvels of</p>

<p>cechnology, although the mass media are now full of stories of poisoned<br>water, air, and soil; of depleted resources and of overcrowding--all<br>clearly among its adverse effects, all crying out for/ remedial action.<br>what chiefly delays public recognition of the costs of the<br>ecientific-technologicat revolution is, I submit, the universal popularity<br>of its objectives material abundance and /an easing of man&#x27;s earthly lot<br>throuch mastery of nature, the empire of man over nature&quot; of which<br>Francis Bacon dreamed three ana a half centuries ago. Modern technology.<br>solidly pased on accurate scientific knowledce. comes remarkably close<br>to this goal- Even the poorest in technically aavanced countries are<br>petter fed, housed, and clothed; work in safer, more comfortable<br>surroundings; enjoy greater leisure and more varied entertainments, live<br>longer and healthier lives) than they could ever hope for in the vast<br>packward regions of the earthp this accounts for what W. H. Ferry calls<br>the &quot;stupid love affair&quot; of the general public with technology-<br>“Breaking Up the love affair,&quot; he said, “does not mean abandoning<br>technolocy, put replacing infatuation with an understanding of its</p>
<p>toxic qualities, and finding ways to direct it to humane ends.&quot;</p>
<p>al</p>
<p>Fortunately we have a means to such an understanding in| ecology--</p>
<p>a science conterminous with modern technology-</p>
<p>e \leos :<br>Derived from the Greek Oikos, meaning household or living place,</p>
<p>_ .<br>ecology deals with the interjrelationships of plants and animals (including<br>man), and their environment. Ecology, until recently 4 modest academic</p>
<p>discipline chiefly serving agriculture ana medicine, is destined to</p>
<p>le</p>
<p>some the key science for correctly assessing the negative aspects of<br>echnology In my opinion, ecology should be included in the eurriculum of<br>pur schools. In this connection, I should like to make two suggestions:<br>First, limit the study to plant and animal ecology, which is a fully<br>Zeveloped branch of the exact sciences, omitting for the time being what</p>
<p>es under the name of social ecology. We tend in this country to try to<br>———</p>
<p>as well as we might. Second, consider the possibility of peginning the<br>study at an early age. During a visit to Switzerland for the purpose of<br>familiarizing myself with their educational system, I was much impressed<br>by the way ecology was taught in a one-room village schoolhouse. It was<br>part of the curriculum throughout the primary grades, being presented at<br>first very simply--but always graphically; later, on a more complex level;<br>and always alongside the three Rts and history, and government, so that the<br>children absorb it as part of their general education.</p>
<p>What needs to be developed at the earliest opportunity is a habit of<br>thinking ecologically, of being thoroughly familiar with the balance of<br>nature ,which Barry Commoner, the biologist, recently defined in simple<br>words comprehensible to the nonscientist, old or young. All living things,<br>he said, &quot;are dependent on the great interwoven cyclical processes, |</p>
<p>followed by the four elements that make up the major portion of living</p>
<p>things and the environment: carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. All<br>of these cycles are driven by the action of living things.&quot; Green plants</p>
<p>convert carbon dioxide into food, fiber, and fuel, and produce the oxygen</p>
<p>in the atmosphere. Animals, living basically on plant-produced food,</p>
<p>megemerate the inorganic materials: carbon dioxide, nitrates, aaé<br>gimosphetes--all of which support plant life. This vast web of biological<br>Eeterections &quot;makes up a huge, enormously complex living machine--the<br>ecosphere--and on the integrity and proper functioning of that machine<br>depends every human activity, including technologye..-.-df we destroy it,<br>eux most aavenced technology will come to naught and any economic and<br>nolitical system which depends on it will founder.&quot;</p>
<p>I wonder, too, whether ecolocy, properly presented at the higher<br>secondary school levels, might not help dissipate the tendency in<br>comtemporary thinking of regarding technology as an irresistible force<br>with a momentum of its own , that puts it beyond human direction and<br>restraint. Mere awareness of all the adverse effects of technology may<br>not suffice to mobilize public support for countervailing measures.</p>
<p>What is additionally needed is a change of attitude on the part of the</p>
<p>public and of its leaders Phat is, of the prevailing concepts of whet</p>
<p>technology is, and what purpose it should serve. Only when viewed</p>
<p>rae other words, as a means to human ends--can technology</p>
<p>be made to produce maximum benefit, and do minimum harm to human beings,</p>
<p>and to the values that make for civilized living. fee ner ever-phanle</p>

<p>tobe. of. technology it, ean. rightly be said that it is/not. Weither—good<br>or bad;—but- thinking wkkes it 36.&quot; /</p>
<p>Technology has been defined as that which covers &quot;the field of how</p>
<p>things are commonly done or made&quot; and &quot;what things are done or made.&quot; It</p>
<p>is tools, techniques, procedures: the artifacts and processes fashioned</p>
<p>Sy mocerm industrial man to increase his powers of mind and body.<br>Wacwelouws they are, but let us not be overawed by these man-made things.<br>Certainly they themselves do not dictate how we should use them jnor, by<br>their mere existence, do they authorize actions that were not anteriorly<br>lawful. We alone bear responsibility for our technology. In this, as in<br>all our actions ,we are bound by the principles governing human behavior</p>
<p>im our society. Ethics, I need hardly say, are not only personal; they<br>are social as well.</p>
<p>f This surely must be obvious to any reasonable man. Yet it cannot be<br>overemphasized, for a considerable body of opinion propagates what comes<br>close to being the opposite view.’ The notion is widespread that, having<br>wrought vast changes in the material conditions of life, technology<br>perforce renders obsolete traditional concepts of ethics and morals, as<br>well as accustomed ways of arranging political and social relationships.<br>Earnest debates are currently taking place as to whether it is possible<br>to act morally in the new technological society, and proposals have been<br>made--quite seriously--that science must now replace traditional ethics!<br>We have here a confusion of means with ends ,that should be cleared up.</p>
<p>The laws disclosed by science must of course be heeded by those who<br>wish to exploit scientific discoveriesr in his technological activities</p>
<p>man is bound by the laws of science. But it does not follow that he is</p>
<p>bound by the laws of science in his purely human relations as well.</p>
<p>/ “Science,&quot; wrote Vannevar Bush, “has come a long way. in delineating the</p>
<p>probable nature of the universe that surrounds us; of the physical world</p>
<p>in which we live? of our own structure? our physical and chemical nature.</p>
<p>ot ewem exters into the mechanism by which the brain itself operates.</p>
<p>gt comes to the question of consciousness and_ free will--and there</p>
<p>Mo longer can science prove, or even bear evidence. Those who</p>
<p>base their personal philosophies or their religion upon science are left,<br>bean that point, without support.&quot;</p>
<p>Through technology man has been relieved of much brutal, exhausting,<br>physical labor as well as of boring routine works fe has been provided<br>with mumerous mechanical slaves who do certain kinds of work faster,<br>cheaper and more efficiently than people. Why should the ease and affluence<br>made possible by technology affect precepts that have guided western man<br>for centuries? This may brand me 4s old-fashioned ,but I have not yet<br>found occasion to discard 4 single principle that was accepted in the<br>america of my youth. Why should anyone feel in need of a new ethical code<br>because he is healthier, or has more possessions )OF more leisure? Does it<br>make sense to abandon rules one has lived by jbecause he has acquired better<br>tools for doing his work?</p>
<p>ES</p>
<p>Tools are for utilizing the external resources at our disposal.</p>
<p>SS</p>
<p>—————</p>
<p>Principles are for marshaling our inner, our human resources. With tools</p>
<p>—— ae</p>
<p>we alter our physical environments Wien principles we order our personal<br>Pin il mie<br>life and our relations with others. The two have nothing to do with each<br>other. .<br>It disturbs me to be told that technology &quot;demands&quot; an action the<br>speaker favoOrse hat “you can&#x27;t stop progress -&quot; It troubles me, that we<br>are so easily pressured by purveyors of technology jnto permitting</p>
<p>so-called &quot;progress&quot; to alter our lives, without attempting to control it--</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>me 2£ techmology were an/ irrepressible force of nature to which we must<br>ee samit./ If we reflected, we might discover that not everything<br>ibeiled as progress contributes to happiness; that the new is not always<br>better, nor the old always outdated.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are receptive to these arguments because we tend to<br>-onfuse technology with science. Not only in popular, thinking, but even<br>among the well-informed ,the two are not always clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>Im consequence, characteristics pertaining to science are attributed |to<br>technology. The etymology of the word may contribute to this confusion.<br>Its suffix lends to technology a false aura--as if it signified a body of<br>accumulated, systematized knowledge, when in fact the term refers to the<br>apparatus through which knowledge is put to practical use. The gifference<br>is important.</p>
<p>Science has to do with discovering the true facts and relationships<br>of observable phenomena in nature, and with establishing theories that<br>serve to organize masses of verified data concerning these facts and<br>relationships. Because of the care scientists take to verify the facts<br>supporting their theories; because of their readiness to alter theories<br>when new facts prove an established theory to be imperfect, science<br>has great authority. What the scientific community accepts 45s proven</p>
<p>is not questioned by the public. No one disputes that the earth</p>
<p>attracts the moon, Or that atomic fission produces energy-</p>
<p>But technology cannot claim the authority of science. It has<br>ce TS REEL</p>
<p>proved anything but infallibly beneficial. Much harm has been done</p>
<p>7 mem amd mature because technologies have been used with no thought for<br>“Se geecible consequences of their interaction with nature. A certain<br>swrbllessmess has been encouraged by the mistaken belief that/to disregard<br>‘Summer comsiderations is as necessary in technology as it is in science.<br>The emalogy is false.<br>The mitthods of science require rigorous exclusion of the human factor.<br>They were developed to serve the needs of scientists, whose sole interest<br>fis to comprehend the universe; to know the truth; to know it accurately<br>amd with certainty. The searcher for truth cannot ‘pay attention to his<br>omm or to other people&#x27;s likes and dislikes, or to popular ideas of the<br>fitmess of things. This is why science is’ the Antithésis of &quot;humanism,&quot;<br>despite the fact that historically modern science developed out of, and<br>parallel to the humanism of the Renaissance.<br>What scientists discover may shock or anger people--as aia[ Darwin&#x27;s<br>theory of [evolution. But even an| unpleasant truth is worth havings<br>Besides one can choose not to believe it! It is otherwise with technology.</p>
<p>Science, being pure thought, harms no one; therefore it need not be</p>
<p>humanistic. But technology is action, and often potentially dangerous:</p>
<p>en eae<br>action.. Unless it is made to adapt itself to human interests, needs,<br>values, and principles, more harm will be done than good. Never before,<br>in all his long life on earth, has man possessed such enormous power to |<br>injure himself, his human fellows, and his society as has been put into<br>his hands by modern technology.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to maintain a humanistic attitude toward</p>
<p>technology; to recognize clearly) that since it is a product of human effort,</p>
