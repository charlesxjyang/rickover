        <p>Remarks by ' Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Navy ‘ On the Occasion of the . Commissioning of the USS TEXAS (CGN 39) . at the U. S. Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia Saturday, 10 September 1977 I want to express my congratulations to the officers and men of the © TEXAS, and I particularly -want to acknowledge the contributions of the man who represents the 19th District of the Lone Star State. - Congressman Mahon's standards of integrity and honor, professional conduct and competence, are of immense importance to the well-being of our country. As Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, he is one of the few men in government upon whom the responsibility rests to recommend to Congress the specific allocation of funds for each and every phase of work supported by the Federal Government. He is a man of intense convictions; yet he is always open-minded. He knows his goals at all times, and he has the ability, experience, deter- mination, and strength of character—all combined with high resolve and patriotism—to perform his duties in the best interest of this Nation. He never wavers from ceaseless devotion to a strong defense for the United i States. . He knows that in today's troubled world, if one might err in judg-</p>
<p>ment, it is better to err on the side of strength than on the side of weakness.</p>
<p>I have known Mr. Mahon for more than thirty years. I know that in</p>
<p>addition to his other characteristics he is a religious man. He is aware</p>
<p>that values come from religion, not culture; that the ultimate test of religious and political values is not definable in terms of how they</p>
<p>happen, but of what was achieved, While engineering is a man using</p>
<p>a pick and Shovel, religion is a man using a divining rod, Congressman</p>
<p>Mahon exemplifies the standards of morality and excellence when religion is an important part of a person's life,</p>
<p>Mr. Mahon, your presence in Congress will be sorely missed, I thank you for your strong support and I wish continued health and happiness to Mrs. Mahon and you in the years ahead. May it please</p>
<p>the Lord that they be as productive as they have been,</p>
