      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1975 address to the National Youth Science Camp, Admiral H. G. Rickover cautions prospective scientists about the profound yet sometimes detrimental impact of science and technology. While acknowledging its potential for human welfare and its role in revolutionizing lives, Rickover highlights the negative consequences that have arisen, such as pollution, environmental destruction, and threats to freedom, stemming from an uncritical pursuit of technology for short-term economic gains. He references the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago and its philosophy, contrasting the beneficial aspects of scientific advancement with its current challenges. Rickover urges the delegates to prioritize the humanistic application of scientific principles, concluding with Francis Bacon&#x27;s timeless wisdom that knowledge should be sought for the &quot;benefit and use of life,&quot; rather than for personal pleasure, contention, or power.</p>

        <p>bo ie Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy to the Delegates of the National Youth Science Camp July 16, 1975 I am honored to be here with this group of prospective scientists. You are entering an exciting field which has potential for the welfare of mankind. However, I would caution you to remember that the fruits of science-technology-may be used in ways harmful to man. In 1933, the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago focused on the contri- butions of scientific technology to economic development. The philosophy of the organizers of this Exposition was clearly stated in the guidebook of the fair: &quot;Science discovers, genius invents, industry applies, and man adapts himself to, or is molded by, new things. Individuals, groups, entire races of men, fall into step with science and industry.&quot;</p>
<p>We are seeing today the results of that philosophy. While science and technology have revolutionized our lives in many beneficial ways, we are saddled also with pollution, destruction of the environment, and threats to our freedom as «- ~ individuals. Man has too easily allowed himself to be led by technology, to accept a degradation in the quality of life for short term economic gains.</p>
<p>Many of you, perhaps the majority, will spend your careers not expanding the theoretical limits of science, but applying and adapting scientific principles to practical use. It is important to recognize that this resulting technology is a ‘product of human effort and as such must be used humanistically. What Francis Bacon said four centuries ago is appropriate today:</p>
<p>&quot;Knowledge is not to be sought either for pleasure of mind, or for</p>
<p>contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit, or fame, or</p>
<p>power, or any of these inferior things; but for the benefit and use</p>
<p>of life.&quot; %</p>
