      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this April 12, 1975 speech accepting the Gideon Welles Award, Admiral H. G. Rickover delivers a pointed critique of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s administrative evolution, contrasting its bloated, &quot;top-heavy&quot; 1975 structure with the efficient, centralized control exercised by Civil War Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Rickover highlights that Welles ran a 600-ship Navy with only 87 staff and direct presidential access, whereas by 1975, the Secretary&#x27;s power was diminished, no longer a Cabinet member. He presents striking figures: in 1975, there were 288 admirals for 500 ships (more than one per two ships) compared to one flag officer per 27 ships in 1865; only 31% of officers had sea duty; and the Navy employed over 200 times more civilians than in 1865. Rickover concludes by advocating for a return to Welles&#x27; principles of purpose and economy, urging the Navy and Defense Department to shed excessive layering, staff, and &quot;overadministration&quot; that stifles initiative and saps productive energy.</p>

        <p>at Hartford, Connecticut</p>
<p>Saturday, April 12, 1975</p>
<p>I am honored to receive the GIDEON WELLES AWARD. It is particularly gratifying because Welles is recognized today for having valued principle over political expediency during his life. I believe that, more than ever, we all need to follow his example in our own lives.</p>
<p>In studying Gideon Welles' tenure as Secretary of the Navy, one is struck by the amount of control he exercised over every facet of the Navy. Aided by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox and a Navy Department consisting of 87 military and civilian employees-——a miniscule number by today's standards— he ran a Navy of over 600 ships and the Marine Corps during the Civil War. He was the senior decision-maker to whom all plans were submitted; the final authority on matters great and small. Welles personally kept a careful watch over the work in progress in Navy yards as reported weekly by the various commandants. He personally approved the assignment of officers, and he made</p>
<p>the final decisions concerning shipbuilding programs, major naval operations,</p>
<p>and the general lines of naval policy. Moreover, he was a Cabinet member</p>
<p>with ready access to the President.</p>
<p>Compare this with the position of the Secretary of the Navy as it has</p>
<p>evolved over the years. In this regard, please recognize that I am commenting on the position, not on the performance of the many fine men who have held it, including Secretary Middendorf who is here with us today. The Secretary still nominally runs the Navy and the Marine Corps. But his real power is limited. Senior naval officers decide officer assignments and promotion, and the Secretary is consulted only for a few top positions. It is mainly naval officers who watch over the work in the shipyards and formulate plans for shipbuilding programs. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense make, or assist the President in making, decisions on naval operations.</p>
<p>Where the Secretary of the Navy does approve shipbuilding matters or matters of naval policy, he can be effectively overruled by many Defense Department officials. As a sign of his loss of power, he is no longer a Cabinet member and does not have legal access to the President.</p>
<p>The loss of the Secretary's power coincides with the administrative growth of the Service. In Welles' day, the Navy's organization was simple; today it is massive and complex. There are vast layers of civilian and military bureaucrats, and hundreds of admirals, each with his own personal staff. The Navy has ten times as many active duty personnel today as in the Civil War; yet it has over 200 times the number of civilians in the Navy Department as compared to 1865.</p>
<p>It has essentially become a top-heavy land force with a small percentage of its officers at sea. In 1865, there were 19 commodores and six admirals in a Navy of 670 ships, or about one flag officer for every 27 ships. On</p>
<p>January 1, 1975, there were 288 admirals for 500 ships, or more than one for</p>
<p>every two ships. In the Civil War, nearly every admiral was at sea commanding a squadron. Today, there are more admirals in Washington than in all the rest of the Navy. In addition, only 31% of all officers have sea duty billets. The remainder, over two-thirds of all officer billets, are on shore.</p>
<p>In World War II, there was one flag officer for every 7200 men in the Navy. Today, there is one admiral for every 2000 men. Lest you think this is happening only in the Navy, a similar situation obtains in the other services. Both the Air Force and Army are even more top-heavy than the Navy, with one general for every 1600 men, Moreover, there are nearly twice as many colonels and lieutenant colonels in the Air Force today as the entire number of planes in that service. However, the Army and Air Force combined have only four generals in their Dental Corps; the Navy's Dental Corps alone has four admirals, although it serves only half as many men as the total Army and Air Force.</p>
<p>All of this should give us pause. What are we profiting from this top-heavy structure, with its high cost, and with the organization and Management that plagues the Defense Department ? It certainly does not guarantee personal attention. We even use machines today to assign many in the Navy, and the reports on fitness of our officers are now so prepared that a machine can read them. What we do have is overadministration that stifles initiative and saps productive energy in endless meetings and paperwork,</p>
<p>The Navy and the Defense Department would do well to cut out much of the layering, the staffs, and the overadministration. We should recapture the sense</p>
<p>f purpose and €conomy shown by Gideon Welles more than a century ago.</p>
