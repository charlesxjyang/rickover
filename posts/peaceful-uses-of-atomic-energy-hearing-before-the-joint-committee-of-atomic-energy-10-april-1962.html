      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this April 10, 1962, hearing before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Admiral Hyman Rickover, &quot;Father of Our Nuclear Navy,&quot; discusses the dual importance of atomic power for military and civilian applications. He details the rapid expansion of the nuclear navy, citing the successful trials of the Polaris submarine JOHN MARSHALL (the 26th atomic submarine), and highlights the capabilities of the nuclear-powered USS ENTERPRISE (the largest, most powerful aircraft carrier) and USS LONG BEACH cruiser. For civilian power, Rickover extols the experimental Shippingport reactor, noting its record 1 billion kilowatt-hours generated and 97% availability, emphasizing its role in learning how to achieve competitive atomic power in the future. A significant portion of his testimony is dedicated to a stark critique of the U.S. educational system, comparing it unfavorably to European (specifically Swiss) and Soviet systems in terms of efficiency and rigor, lamenting the &quot;four-year waste&quot; in American schooling and the quality of teacher training. He presents statistics on engineer output (Russia 120,000/year vs. US 40,000) and functional illiteracy in the U.S., advocating for a more intellectually focused curriculum to foster earlier productivity (citing 29 as the average peak for scientists) and counter what he views as a &quot;moral disintegration&quot; in public education. He also references his books, &quot;Education and Freedom&quot; and &quot;Swiss Schools and Ours: Why Theirs Are Better,&quot; as resources for reform.</p>

        <p>Hearing before the ‘of ) Joint Committee on Atomic Energy 13 ey Congress of the United States</p>
<p>April 10, 1962 Chairman Holifield. Our next witness this morning will be</p>
<p>Admiral Hyman Rickover who is the &quot;Father of Our Nuclear Navy.&quot; Admiral Rickover, will you please come forward to the witness chair?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, Good morning, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. Good morning. It is again a pleasure to welcome you as a witness before this committee before which you have appeared so many times.</p>
<p>Admiral exces It is a great pleasure to appear before your committee, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. Admiral Rickover, you may proceed.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I would appreciate, sir, since I have no prepared statement thi the committee question me and I will attempt to answer your questions.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. Will you please tell us why you think atomic power is important?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. All modern industrial societies depend on energy resources. The “present rate of increase in the use of these resources, I believe is about ten percent per, year in the United States. About one hundred years ago only five percent of the energy we used came from gas, oil or coal; one percent came from water power; the rest came from the muscle power of human beings and animals. But today the story is quite different. Today only about four percent of the energy we use comes from human beings and animals,</p>
<p>one percent from water power, and 94 percent to 95 percent comes from</p>
<p>coal, oil or gas. It is evident we are increasingly dependent on</p>
<p>artificial sources of energy. Again, in the last fifty years the world has used more coal, oil and gas than has been used previously in all history. If our rate of using fossil fuel sources continues at the rate we are using them now, in about a hundred years we can look to serious shortages. Therefore it is highly prudent that we develop alternative sources of energy. Atomic power gives us this means;</p>
<p>that is why it is important. If we do not develop it now, if we do not take the time we have now to get it so it can be useful, we will surely be caught short on energy resources.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. We are developing this power for both military and peaceful purposes?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. What are we doing in the Navy with atomic power?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is an appropriate question because just this morning I returned from the trials of the Polaris submarine JOHN MARSHALL. I just got back about an hour and a half ago. This past Sunday and yesterday we were at sea submerged and we ran at full power. This is the first time this ship has been to sea and I would like to report to you, sir, that the trials were successful. The JOHN MARSHALL is our ninth Polaris atomic powered submarine, and our 26th atomic powered submarine. With the authorization measure now before Congress there will be a total of 75 atomic submarines authorized and, as I</p>
<p>just mentioned, we already have 26 in operation, of which 9 are Polaris</p>
<p>type. The JOHN MARSHALL, the same as the other 8 Polaris type submarines,</p>
<p>carries sixteen nuclear missiles. These 9 submarines give us the capacity to launch 144 Polaris type missiles. The 16 missiles carried on each submarine carry more explosive power than has been used in all history, both in war and in peace.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. Of course we expect to use this power to maintain the security of the United States and the free world, not for aggressive purposes, but for defensive purposes?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is right, sir. That is the only reason that impels your Committee, as I and all my co-workers well know, to work in this field. We know that by having these ships submerged on station they deter a potential aggressor from attacking the United States. An aggressor must know that if he does launch an attack against the United States, he himself must inevitably be destroyed. That is why our Polaris submarines are so important a deterrent. In addition to the nuclear submarines we also have nuclear powered surface ships. The ENTERPRISE which has 8 reactors is our first nuclear powered aircraft carrier. The Committee boarded that ship in Guantanamo Bay a week ago Saturday and witnessed night flying and other exercises.</p>
<p>The ENTERPRISE is the largest ship in the world. She displaces over 86,000 tons. She developes more than 280,000 shaft horsepower, which makes her the most powerful ship in the world. Further she is the fastest aircraft carrier in the Navy.</p>
<p>We also have the nuclear powered cruiser LONG BEACH, which was</p>
<p>launched by Mrs. Craig Hosmer, wife of Congressman Hosmer of California.</p>
<p>The LONG BEACH has two reactors, and she has been operating successfully. Late this year we expect to go to sea on the first nuclear powered destroyer leader, the BAINBRIDGE. This ship will be capable of steaming about 150,000 miles continuously at full power before she has to be refueled. It is obvious what atomic power can do for the Navy, particularly in submarines. Previous submarines, before the advent of atomic power, could remain submerged at full power for only one hour. The atomic submarines can remain submerged at full power practically indefinitely. Our submarines operate continuously submerged for over sixty days at a time. Our Polaris submarines do that.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. We would like to have you also comment on civilian atomic power because you have been the one who has been responsible for the great Shippingport reactor, 4 model of which we have here in this room, and a reactor which has taught us more about achieving electrical power through atomic fission than any other reactor. Could you give us a word on the possibilities of civilian atomic power?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. it is my considered opinion that we are well on the road toward civilian power. The exact time atomic power will be competitive with ecnverttdonal power is not important. At present it is more important to use the time we have and the money we spend for development to learn how to get reliable and safe atomic power plants. The Shippingport reactor was authorized by Congress in 1953. Ground breaking was on Labor Day, 1954, and in December 1957</p>
<p>the plant started delivering power. We are still using the same</p>
<p>loading of natural uranium fuel in that reactor as we had in December</p>
<p>1957; if we wished we could keep operating on that load of uranium fuel several years more. This fact illustrates the marvel of atomic power more than anything I can say. That is, nuclear fuel can be inserted once and last for many years. May I explain from the model, Mr. Chairman? Chairman Holifield. Yes, I think that would be very helpful. Admiral Rickover. This is a one eighth scale model of the Shippingport reactor. The actual reactor height from the potion up to this point is about 42 feet. The nuclear core is this part inside the pressure vessel. The core is the part that contains the uranium. There are about fourteen tons of natural uranium in this core. These pressure vessel closure bolts you see are actually much larger since this is a one eighth scale model; each weighs six hundred pounds. There are forty-two bolts in all to hold the head to the reactor vessel. This top part is where the mechanisms which control the nuclear reactor are located. All these little things that you see at the top of the</p>
<p>vessel closure are instruments. Since Shippingport is a development</p>
<p>’ reactor we have installed several hundred instruments inside the</p>
<p>pressure vessel so we can tell at all times what is going on inside the nuclear core. If we did not have these instruments we could not learn anywhere near as much as we have been able to. This past December the energy produced by this reactor reached one billion kilowatt hours; this was more than any nuclear reactor in this</p>
<p>country had ever produced. Also, we have just completed a run of</p>
<p>125 days continuously at full power on this reactor. This is the</p>
<p>longest any nuclear power plant in the country has ever run at full power. The Shippingport reactor, if one discounts the time used for pratt and testing, has over a long period of time had a 97 percent availability factor. That is, it could have been on the line 97 percent of the time, which is an outstanding record even for a conventional central station plant. The Shippingport reactor has demonstrated that — power can be used on any electrical grid. The reactor is located at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, which is about</p>
<p>25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Its electricity is</p>
<p>generated into the Duquesne Light Company grid, and so it supplies</p>
<p>the city of Pittsburgh with power. In the operation of this reactor</p>
<p>—— ’°&gt; oo</p>
<p>plant, it has been necessary for the U. S. Government to work closely with a private utility, the Duquesne Light Company. I am happy to say that Mr. Fleger, Chairman of the Board of the Duquesne Light Company, has always been thoroughly cooperative and understanding of the technological needs of this program and of its contribution to civilian atamic power.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. That is sufficient, I think, for that point. Are there any questions on the part of the committee?</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, in order to get into some of the details of cost, is it not true that the Shippingport reactor is an experimental reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. Incidentally, Mr. Van Zandt, I am</p>
<p>very happy that this reactor is located in your state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Thank you.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Van Zandt has been of great help to us throughout this project.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, what is the cost to manufacture a kilowatt hour of electrical energy at Shippingport?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. It costs us much more than conventional power, but cost is meaningless here because this is an experimental reactor. Our objective was not to produce electricity. It was to design a reactor from which we could learn. It is an ccpeyimeivtiil tool. So I believe any figure I might give you would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. You have answered the question by saying it costs much more than conventional power.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir, because it is designed primarily as an experimental tool to advance reactoz technology, and not for the purpose of producing competetive electrical powei. At this stage it is important to learn how we can produce competitive atomic power in the future. That is the real purpose of the Shippingport plant.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Is it not true that we have other reactors in operation today where the cost per kilowatt hour has been cut considerably?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. And is now becoming competitive, we will say, with other fuels in certain areas or sections of the United States?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We have other reactors where the power costs</p>
<p>less than at Shippingport because Shippingport was the first such</p>
<p>plant to be built. It was designed primarily as an experimental reactor. As I have said, it has many instruments. We spend a great deal of time getting technical data including extensive physics and fuel element data and we publish and disseminate this information widely. In time atomic power should be competitive with other sources of energy. One cannot tell yet when that day will come. But the time will come because atomic power is being--it is becoming cheaper, while coal, oil and gas are bound to get more expensive. So at some point the two lines will cross.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, for the benefit of the boys and girls who are here this morning, would you explain just how you use uranium for the purpose of producing power by Shipping- port?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. As, I suppose, even these young citizens know, when uranium is concentrated in a certain manner, fission occurs. That means that the neutrons, through fission, reproduce themselves. These neutrons from the fission process travel at very high speeds. They are very small particles, and as they travel through the rest of the uranium and the cooling water which surrounds it, they are slowed down from their initial high speed by collision with the hydrogen atoms in the water. They are then absorbed by uranium atoms which in turn fission into two or more fragments. These fission fragments</p>
<p>which have a lot of energy are brought to rest by the friction</p>
<p>between them and other atoms. This friction then causes heat. This</p>
<p>heat is taken away with water or with gas or with liquid metal or some other coolant. This heat is,in turn, used to heat water. The water becomes steam; the steam drives a turbine. I think this is sufficient for our youthful citizens at this point.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, for the benefit of the boys and girls here this morning would you again describe how we use uranium metal for the purpose of producing electric energy such as we do at Shippingport?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Uranium has a characteristic that if it is arranged in a certain geometrical fashion it will fission. That is, the uranium atoms split apart and yon the average ,two and one-half neutrons come out from each fission process. The neutrons are very minute particles which travel at tremendously high speeds. As they travel through the rest of the uranium and surrounding water they are slowed down by collision mainly with bydrogen atoms of the water; they are then absorbed by uranium atoms which in turn again fission into 2 or more fragments. These fission fragments,which have a lot of energy,are brought to rest by friction between these and other atoms. This friction causes heat. The heat is removed either by water, by gas or by liquid metal, or by any other heat transfer medium. It is then used to heat water. This water then changes to steam. The steam then drives the turbine. The turbine drives the generator and in this way we make electricity.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Now, would you go a step further and</p>
<p>explain how we employ this for ship propulsion?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. The same process, of course, is true of ship propulsion as of any other type of reactor. On a ship the steam is formed, the steam drives a turbine, the turbine drives a reduction. gear. A propeller shaft is attached to the reduction gear, and the propeller at the end of the shaft pushes the ship through the water. A turbine is efficient at high speeds, while a propeller is efficient at low speeds. That is why it is necessary to have a reduction gear. It reduces the high speed of the turbine to the low speed of the propeller.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Now, Admiral, would you explain some day just how we hope to take energy directly from a nuclear reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Considerable work is being done on thermo- electric energy conversion. This means that we can get electricity directly from some combination of metals by having each metal at a different temperature. That is we could make slecnedetty directly from the heat generated nuclearly inside the uranium, without the need for a heat exchanger or a turbine. This electricity would be generated directly from thermo-electric metals and could rotate a motor, which in turn could drive either a propeller for ship propulsion, or a generator to make electricity. We can already make thermo-electric generators capable of driving electric motors of about five horsepower, but we still have a long way to go before this can become a reality for large power plants either ashore or afloat.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. Congressman Hosmer has some questions.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral Rickover, you have built and operated nuclear power reactors to go under the sea and over the sea and on the land. I wonder if you would tell us how many you have built and put into operation, and then estimate for us how many other power reactors have been built and operated in all the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I believe it is safe to say that in my program we have more atomic power reactors in operation right now than all of the rest of the world put together. We have forty-three atomic power plants of various sizes and various kinds operating today. Of course, as you know, we are increasing the number rapidly. Including these 43 reactors, I believe there are a total of about 75 power reactors operating in the world today.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. From that vamtage point, Admiral Rickover, would you have anything to suggest to the young Americans of eoday with respect to our nuclear future and what their part might be in it?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. If God gave me the opportunity to know, at their age, what I now know I certainly would work a lot harder. I would try to become 4 scientist or engineer, but I would not forget the humanities. I would also study much harder. If you care, I would like to discuss some of the educational aspects of atomic power as well as of all science, engineering and the humanities. If there is one thing I have learned it is that no youngster can afford to waste any of the time he spends at school. It takes 16 years tn our country for a youngster to go through school--through grammar school,</p>
<p>high school and college. Yet abroad, in continental Europe, this is done</p>
<p>in twelve years. So there is, at least, a four year waste of time in the United States. One of the main reasons for this waste is that our teachers are not as well trained professionally as they are'in other countries of the world. And everybody knows, I am sure, that the teacher is the key factor in any educational system. “The system stands or falls, depending on his ability. This matter of teacher training has been commented on by Mr. McMurrin, United States Commissioner of Education. I believe the most important thing for us is to improve the teaching profession. Many teachers now rate with business administration people as being at the bottom in their colleges. That is, the best students do not normally go into teaching. We must do a great deal to improve the teaching profession. Furthermore,</p>
<p>since our children are at school only one-sixth of their waking time-- about the same amount of time they look at television, which is most unfortunate--I think itis important that the school not be burdened with so many functions that have no real place in the school. The school should be used to train the intellect. _The home, the @hunsh</p>
<p>and the community should undertake their own jobs of taking care of</p>
<p>the character and the morals of the children.</p>
<p>We should let the schools alone and not bother them with extraneous matters, in view of the short time they have the children. If these youngsters here this morning were old enough to understand, they would know they shoulda waste no time, because the Pubure is going to be much more difficult than the past or the present. One cannot</p>
<p>become an educated person today just by spending four years at college.</p>
<p>One can no longer even become educated by studying for many years more, because knowledge is doubling every ten years. Therefore, even after one has completed his education, he must devote at least one- tenth of his time to keep up with the new knowledge being developed. If he doesn't do this much, at least, he will fall behind. Representative Hosmer. In other words » those of us who have finished our formal schooling should keep up and educate ourselves to meet the problems of the world that just come from new knowledge alone, is that right? Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. I would advise the children not to look at TV as much as they do. It is one of the most baneful | influences in this country. I hope this is recorded. Representative Hosmer. I am going to carry that remark home to my own children. Chairman Holifield. Admiral Rickover, because you did make a remark in regard to the incompetence of gome teachers » I am going to take this occasion to introduce a school teacher from an elementary grade school in Gardena, California, who is the sponsor of this group of children. He is, in my opinion, one of the finest examples of the kina of teachers that we want in America. I might say in addition to his classroom activities, he is also teaching a group of United States Navy personnel each week. So he must be pretty good if he is teaching the Navy. I want to introduce him. Mr. Robert Myron Content, will you oe stand up at this time and take a bow? 3</p>
<p>Mr. Content. Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. We are happy to have your group with us.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I would like to explain my remarks. I believe there is no group of people in our country more devoted than our</p>
<p>teachers. I believe our system for educating teachers can be very</p>
<p>much improved. I think the reason we are doing even as well as we do in our schools is a compliment to our teaching personnel. I think they should be higher paid and I think the people of this country should arrange for them to be better educated, because our children are our — gold reserve, our true gold reserve, and we must take the best care we can of our true gold reserve. 3</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. We know of your great interest in education. Are there any further questions?</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, when several of us on the committee visited Russia some years ago and saw the Russian synchroton, we were amazed to find young men and women there in their earliest: | twenties, physicists in their own right. What you advocate, as I understand it, is that we eliminate some of the years that are being wasted, so that the education may be completed by young Americans and s0 that we may have physicists in their earlier twenties as Russia does today.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I would, sir. It is wrong to expect a young man or woman to be going to school until 25 or 26 before they graduate, because many young people want to have a home, start their families and have children. If we can reduce the educational process by three</p>
<p>or four years that would be a great boon. To give you some figures,</p>
<p>the Russians are currently graduating about 120,000 engineers a year, while we are graduating about 40,000. They expect, within the next few years, to increase their output of engineers to about 145,000 a year. They now have about one million,one hundred thousand engineers, of which about 800,000 are practicing engineering. We only have about 600,000 practicing engineers.</p>
<p>About fifty percent of the doctors in Russia are women; we have about one percent. There is great opportunity for our boys and girls if they work hard to get ahead faster. I am glad to see that our colleges are beginning to admit high school students into the sophomore year, and in some cases to the junior year. This way our children are not peing held back. There is a great deal we must do to make our country strong. Even if the cold war were to end tomorrow, we would still be competing industrially with the Soviets. Forty years ago Russia stood tenth in production, in industrial production. In but forty years she has risen to second place. She rose from a time when half of her people were illiterate until today her illiteracy rate is no worse, probably better, than ours. Eleven million adult Americans cannot read a newspaper, traffic signs » or directions on medicine bottles.</p>
<p>We have, according to President Kennedy, about eight percent functional illiterates in this gountny. A functional illiterate is a man or a woman who can read but doesn't really understand what he is reading.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, you have had a lot of experience with physicists over a period of years. What is the most</p>
<p>productive period from an age standpoint of the physicists that you</p>
<p>have been associated with?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I can only use statistics because the period of productivity varies from one person td another. On a statistical basis, after a man gets to be about 29 years of age he rarely produces new ideas. This is not true for all people, because there have been many men, such as Leonardo da Vinei, Michaelangelo, Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Fermi and many others who have been quite productive: after reaching 29. But the age when the average manreaches his most.preductive period is 29.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. The reason I ask the question is that upon my return from Russia several years ago, I asked this question of a very prominent educator, and he told me about the same thing, around thirty years of age.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. But the Russians are getting their best production at an average age of about 25. So this four years saving that you advocate means 4 lot in production.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. These four years are very important to our youngsters because the years from about five to twenty-two are the only years really available, when they can put in full time on their education. After that there are too many distractions. That is why a year between five and twenty-two is worth so much. A child of ten, if he knew how much he was being short-changed in his education should go to his parents and say: &quot;Ty will never be ten years old again. Why don't you give me better education and better teachers today? I</p>
<p>will never be ten years old again.&quot; Yet parents do everything else for</p>
<p>their children; good clothes, good food, good entertainment. But</p>
<p>when it comes to training the minds of the children--the only thing that really has meaning--the only thing that is enduring, they do not seem to care. I believe this is so because they believe the clichés our educationists tell them--that &quot;our schools are the best in the world.&quot; Yet plenty of evidence is available to show that our schools are not the best in the world, our teachers are not the best trained.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral, in recommending to the young people to become scientists or engineers, you have used two different terms there, would you explain it?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I will give you my own definition. A scientist generally is a man who deals in abstract matters. He gets ideas. He developes new formulas. An engineer generally is one who takes these abstract concepts and these formulas and tries to make something conerete of them. Another way of saying it is: ‘When a scientist makes a mistake he takes an eraser and erases his mistake. When an engineer makes a mistake it is with a piece-of hardware which he must wear around his neck where everybody can see it. It takes many times the number of engineers to bring to fruition the work which a scientist formulates. For example, when Einstein formulated his Relativity Theory, E=Mc®, he made work for literally hundreds of thousands of engineers.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. For a century or more.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. We need scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>A true scientist is very rare. Many people call themselves scientists</p>
<p>who really are not. For example, our news media call a man a scientist when he says that an investigation made by him shows that the majority of dog-catchers wear black shoes. Actually he may have only talked to one dog-catcher. This is not scientific sampling, it is nose-counting.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. Admiral Rickover, it has been a pleasure as always to have you before this committee as a witness. The staff has privately contacted you and askea for some additional material to include in our record. I know you will, as always, furnish that material.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I would like to say 4 few more words about our educational system:</p>
<p>In anticipating the present world struggle between Western civilization and totalitarian Communism, lenin once remarked that the soundest strategy in war is to postpone operations until the moral disintegration of the enemy renders the mortal blow both possible and easy. Many thoughtful observers of the American scene believe that the seed of moral disintegration is present in our system of public education, and that unless the recent trend of that system toward mediocrity can be checked we will be seriously, perhaps mortally, incapacitated in our individual and national ability to defend the values of the Western world against strong ideological competition.</p>
<p>The American people must be alerted to the deficiencies of our</p>
<p>school system and adopt ways in which we can reform our schools.</p>
<p>Unless we reform our schools in the interests of producing liberally educated citizens in the aggregate, we will not be able to cope with the most serious challenge ever to face our country. I have devoted many years, and long before Sputnik to pointing this out.</p>
<p>Through a painstaking and revealing examination our democracy can, by the establishment of reasonable and realizable national standards, produce an educated citizenry flexible and intelligent enough to face the perplexing and constantly changing circumstances of the modern world. I do not propose that we copy the educational system of any other country but I do believe that there are lessons for Americans in certain aspects of some foreign educational systems and particularly in the serious attitude their people have toward education. We should always bear in mind the remark of Victor Cousin, the nineteenth-century French philosopher: &quot;The true greatness of 4 people does not consist in borrowing nothing from others, but in porrowing from all what is good, and in perfecting whatever is appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>In accordance with your request Mr. Chairman, I would like to include in the record my &quot;Report on Russia,&quot; and my speech &quot;Raucation In A Free Society.&quot;</p>
<p>Considerable information on how we can improve .our educational system can also be obtained from two books I have written, &quot;Bducation and Freedom&quot; published by E. P. Dutton and Campany, and “Swiss Schools and Ours: Why Theirs Are Better&quot; published by Little, Brown and Company.</p>
<p>&quot;Gwiss Schools and Ours&quot; contains the curriculum required of</p>
<p>secondary schools in.Switzerland, together with the examinations the students must take at the end of the secondary school. Any American parent who merely glances at these exams will see at once that, generally, only those who complete college in the United States could equal what Swiss children are able to do at age 18 to 19.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifield. With no objection these will be included in the record.</p>
<p>In concluding our meeting, I hope both you and Dr. Seaborg will have a chance to shake hands with these young people from California. I know they will consider it a great honor and a great privilege.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Holifiela. The meeting will now stand adjourned.</p>
<p>(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the committee adjourned. )</p>
