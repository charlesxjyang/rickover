      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his May 17, 1960 speech, &quot;The Talented Mind – An Opportunity and an Obligation,&quot; Admiral H.G. Rickover asserts that a &quot;good mind&quot; is a priceless endowment carrying a profound obligation to be intelligently developed for both personal fulfillment and national strength. He argues that while physical frontiers may have closed, intellectual pursuits offer new, deeply rewarding &quot;adventures of the mind.&quot; Rickover highlights significant demographic and resource changes since the nation&#x27;s founding &quot;hundred and eighty-four years ago,&quot; noting the population&#x27;s surge from four million to 180 million (increasing by three million annually), and the drastic shift from exporting 15% of raw materials 50 years prior to depending on imports for 10% today. He projects that within 25 years, the U.S. might consume 80% of total world production. Rickover champions &quot;brain power&quot; as the essential solution to resource scarcity and technological advancement, criticizing &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; and &quot;watered-down curricula&quot; for failing to cultivate the talented youth needed to address these critical challenges and secure the nation&#x27;s future.</p>

<p>The talented mind - an opportunity and an obligation</p>
<p>As I look at the bright faces of the young men and women — whose achievement we have come here to honor, I am impressed. with the thought: How fortunate are these young people! Fortunate, in that God has blessed you with a priceless endowment. What. has been given all of you is the most lasting, the most persistently satisfying, the most all-around useful of natural endowments - a</p>
<p>really good mind. | | : ee</p>
<p>I trust that you will not let yourselves be proud of this gift. It reflects no particular credit on you. Nor is it a guarantee of success in life. Rather does it resemble a vein of precious metal imbedded in rock - valuable only when it has been mined intelligently and laboriously. But with it, an unusual — Copyright H. G@. Rickover</p>

<p>opportunity is granted you to develop yourselves into successful human beings in fields of activity where success must always be. rare and difficult. :</p>
<p>You are here because you have already taken the first step towards making use of your good fortune. You have given that good mind of yours what it most needs - exercise in meeting an intellectual challenge. In doing this you have shown yourselves worthy of the endowment with which you have been blessed. You have demonstrated that you can marshall the ambition and stick-to- itiveness which a good mind demands. You have taken the first ' step towards success in your chosen. fields, but only the first.</p>
<p>Like most of today's youth, you must at times have felt you missed something exciting and important because you were born in the 20th century, at a time when almost a all frontier areas of this country had disappeared and with them the adventure formerly enjoyed py many a young man and woman, of hewing out their destiny, dependent on no power on earth but their own will and ability. Today there is hardly a spot on this globe which has not been discovered and mapped. For most people, life, while doubtless more comfortable, lacks the spice of discovery and adventure so dear to young spirits.</p>
<p>Yet it 1s precisely in this respect that your good fortune manifests itself most dramatically, for you carry in your own a minds potentialities for adventure and discovery not shared by</p>
<p>most of your contemporaries. You have as many opportunities for</p>
<p>exciting living as people born a hundred or more years egos a ? different in kind, perhaps, but opportunities not one whit less exciting and rewarding than those which vanished at the turn of this century.</p>
<p>Capable and ambitious young people could once fashion their lives by their own efforts in wild and unmapped areas of the physical world; you can be pioneers today in the wild and unmapped world of the arts and the sciences. In the short span of three centuries, since man first learned to think and experiment scientifically, enormous advances have been made. But enough remains to be discovered and mapped to guarantee excitement and sdventure..to more young men and women than we are likely to have for many years to come.</p>
<p>I recommend that you make your life an adventure of the mind.</p>
<p>This will at times be hard, but always deeply rewarding. When you</p>
<p>reap the fruits of your own intellectual labor you will experience the satisfaction of having proved yourselves good cultivators of the talents given you by Providence. Over and above all this, you will know that yours is a kind of pioneering which yields not alone personal gain and satisfaction, but also contributes significantly to the cultural and economic and hence the political strength and security of our country. This you will find the greatest reward of all.</p>
<p>There never has been a time in the history of our country when it so greatly needed the services of its talented youth. one</p>
<p>hundred and eighty-four years ago, this nation was born one new : _eontinent, sparsely populated by four million people. Seldom has a new nation started life under such favorable circumstances.</p>
<p>Not the least of these was the political inheritance which : &quot;enabled the founding fathers to devise a form of government ae marvelously suited to a vast land with fabulous natural resources which had to be developed by a small population. The Constitution 4nsured fullest scope for each individual's abilities. Moreover, our continuing scarcity of labor helped us to hold fast to that | basic respect of the individual which the first settlers brought with them from England, and which 1s the foundation of our</p>
<p>democratic way of life.</p>
<p>The open frontier kept us socially mobile and therefore checked any tendency towards the class barriers so apt to accompany advances in civilization, and which are characteristic of most highly civilized but static societies. Respect for the</p>
<p>-4ndividual, full opportunities for all, abundance of land and natural resources, and a government eminently suited to our particular needs built this nation into the formidable giant it is today.</p>
<p>In recent years some of the foundations upon which we built in the past have begun to crumble or have vanished altogether. Instead of four million people, lost in a vast wilderness hardly</p>
<p>touched by man, we now have 180 million, increasing annually by</p>
<p>three million, or almost as many new Americans as lived here on</p>
<p>the eve of the Revolution. In fact, we may goon reach a density of population close to that of the old ccuntries of Europe. = Virtually no good free land is left; much of the wilderness which nurtured the free spirit of earlier Americans has all but been buried under factories, cities, and suburban developments. Ana, where even as recently as 50 years ago, we exported 15% of our raw materials, we now depend on the rest of the world for 10% of our raw material needs.</p>
<p>The turning point occurred only a few years ago. Today our consumption of raw materials grows at a compound rate. If we continued to expand our consumption at this same pace for the next 25 years, our needs would reach &amp; fantastic 80% of total world production, leaving only 20% for all other countries. Let me illustrate with a few figures what this momentous change in our raw materials position, from @ resources-exporting to a resources-importing country, portends for our economic health and political strength. -</p>
<p>Advances in medicine and public sanitation have quadrupled the world's population since the middle of the 18th century, and population is increasing at a geometrical rate. Our own country has the highest percentage of natural increase in population of the large industrial nations of the world - an increase higher even than that in Japan and Italy. Scientific calculations give “us the astonishing estimate that one out of every 20 human beings</p>
<p>who have ever trod this earth is alive today.</p>
<p>This enormous and ever-growing population must now be fed, clothed, and housed by cultivating land which over vast areas has — become depleted through erosion and faulty agriculture; by harvesting the.products of the sea and of inland waters which likewise have become depleted by unintelligent overfishing and by pollution; and by consuming irreplaceable mineral and fuel | resources. The United States alone, for example, has consumed a8 much in irreplaceable mineral and fuel resources since 1914 as had then been used by all the world in all of the 5,000 years of history since man first discovered bronze. And much of this ne priceless heritage has been and is being squandered in anappall ingly wasteful manner. :</p>
<p>From a scarcely populated, fabulously resources-rich country 184 years ago we have changed to a densely populated, resources- poor country today. We are, of course, not as poor in resources nor as heavily populated as most of the industrial powers of the world. We are still rich compared to such countries as Britain ‘ or Italy. In fact, with but 10% of the population of the free world and 8% of its land area, we consume close to half the free world's volume of materials. These figures are frequently used to illustrate that we have the highest standard of living in the | world. What seems more significant to me is that these figures also indicate our increasing dependence on foreign countries for vitally needed minerals and fuels. When measured with our wealth</p>
<p>of but a few short years ago, we are therefore poor, and we are</p>
<p>poorer still when measured against our future needs.</p>
<p>The shrinking of the once broad mate industrial civilization makes us for the history dependent on foreign countries fo</p>
<p>technical organization. So far we have h</p>
<p>what we need abroad. But it would not be</p>
<p>rials base of our first time in our r materials pasic to our ad no difficulty buying</p>
<p>wise to count on this.</p>
<p>We shall not remain truly free and powerful unless we compensate,</p>
<p>to the fullest possible extent, for lack</p>
<p>of materials resources</p>
<p>within our own borders. There 4s one way, and only one way; that</p>
<p>this can be done. It is by using far more effectively than</p>
<p>heretofore our natural resources 4n brain power; we must substitute</p>
<p>4ntellectual resources for diminishing ma</p>
<p>terials resources.</p>
<p>Applied to this problem, brain power can devise ways of</p>
<p>extracting at reasonable cost the considerable store of low-grade</p>
<p>minerals and fuels still remaining to us which we are not</p>
<p>utilizing today because of excessive cost</p>
<p>in time and labor - thus</p>
<p>taconite and shale oil may in time make up for the threatened</p>
<p>deficit in high-grade ores and oil. It can discover ways of</p>
<p>replacing scarce materials with plentiful</p>
<p>-‘eonsidered unusable, as aluminum is repla</p>
<p>Trained minds may be able to relieve shor</p>
<p>and fuels by creating man-made substitute</p>
<p>materials heretofore cing scarcer copper. tages of natural minerals</p>
<p>8 as plastics and</p>
<p>synthetic rubber have reduced our dependence on imported tin and</p>
<p>natural rubber, or as atomic power may replace coal and oil.</p>
<p>Similarly, synthetic products made from renewable resources nay</p>
<p>serve as substitutes for irreplaceable ma</p>
<p>Perhaps we need brain power most to teach us the folly of needlessly wasting the inheritance of our children. Using “ irreplaceable materials resources is like using up your capital 4nstead of learning to live on your interest or earnings. No matter how slowly we deplete capital, the day must come when we have nothing to leave our descendants. For almost two centuries we have been wasteful because we thought our natural resources were inexhaustible. |</p>
<p>It will take wise and 4ntelligent guidance — to change our ways. But eventually we may learn to deny ourselves today's pleasures for the sake of leaving enough for our children to let them enjoy the blessings of civilized living. We may even learn to deny ourselves such pleasant luxuries as large, chrome-trimned ears, powered by high-octane gas which discharges thousands of | tons of scarce and irreplaceable lead into the air. Changes in national outlook such as these can only be pioneered by people whose minds are able to grasp the scientific problems involved, and who can make them understood by the average citizen.</p>
<p>It is a truism needing no elaboration that as society becomes more complex technologically, it needs proportionately more, a8 well as qualitatively petter, trained professionals. - Thus, while the population of the United States has doubled in the last 50 years, the number of 4tes professional men and women has quadrupled. We have today five times more engineers and ten times more</p>
<p>scientists than half a century ago and yet there are still not</p>
<p>eae sour ena ee — : Ss : eee eee signee</p>
<p>Se a ee</p>
<p>enough. To increase our national product by a given percentage annually we must increase our seientific and engineering poesonnel: twice as fast. With every step forward in technological progress, the nation pecomes more dependent on 4ts trained brain power.</p>
<p>Moreover, the closer we come to scarcity of natural materials resources, the heavier grows our demand upon the quality of our trained man power. Just as q° is far easier to dig a lump of coal from a surface vein than it. 4s to pump oil from a deep well, perhaps puried under tons of! sea water, 80 it is more difficult © to release the power locked in the atom than the power held in falling water. Substitution of man-made for natural resources, petter utilization of inferior natural resources, elimination of waste - all these demand the raising of our entire body of engineering and scientific knowledge to &amp; higher plateau.</p>
<p>In the past, man's advances in technology have been slow whenever theoretical knowledge failed to move forward. Rome, for example, had everything she needed to puild structures of | reinforced concrete except the necessary theoretical ‘ymowledge of stresses, thrusts, and distribution of weights. From Egypt and Greece, Rome had 4nherited practical knowledge in puilding structures based on lintel and post; from the Etruscens she had inherited the arch; and in Italy she found the raw materials from which she learned by accident to develop a hard and durable</p>
<p>cement. Greece had already ‘.xperimented with strengthening</p>
<p>masonry by imbedding 4ron rods in grooves. ‘Had Rome been able to</p>
<p>Sabine these methods with theoretical kmowledge, she could have puilt her aqueducts and pipe Lines more durably and far less expensively with reinforced cement. =: j In a sense we are today at the Roman stage as regards metallurgical science for nuclear reactor requirements. We must advance not only our knowledge of theoretical and applied nuclear physics but also our entire level of engineering and metallurgy. Similar advances in theoretical knowledge are needed throughout the entire field of science and engineering 4f technical civilization is to be maintained and advanced in a resources-poor world; . How successfully a country manages to raise itself by its own oe pootstraps to ever higher stages of scientific and engineering ion competence will determine that country's position in the world. The fate of our country rests in the hands of those of its citizens whose natural endowments enable them to push back the boundaries of knowledge. : You young people have the ability to grow into empire puilders of the 4{ntellectual realm. I hope you will be inspired to adventurous search beyond present boundaries. I hope you will | not let yourselves be deflected from pursuing this aim by accepting positions having less 4ntrinsic importance put greater material rewards. I hope you will firmly withstand the constant pressure by the advocates of the greatest of modern fallacies - that</p>
<p>_ material possessions are the mark of the successful man. Man's</p>
<p>acquisitive traits are not what make him great. Nor can true</p>
<p>greatness be measured in dollars and cents. What money value can</p>
<p>you assign a book on which the author has labored for years and</p>
<p>which may inspire you to actions having incalculable effects? Is</p>
<p>4t worth only its price of three or five dollars? How would you</p>
<p>value the piece of paper on which Einstein scribbled the simple</p>
<p>equation which in its ultimate effects may preserve the freedom</p>
<p>of the West by providing 4t with nuclear power to replace coal</p>
<p>and o11? Is the pay you receive to be the only measure of the</p>
<p>value of your job? No! Nothing material can ever give the</p>
<p>intelligent man or woman such deep satisfaction as successful |</p>
<p>solution of an intellectual problem that challenges the mind.</p>
<p>We are ‘engaged 4n a grim duel. You are familiar with the</p>
<p>threat to American technical supremacy which may materialize af</p>
<p>Russia succeeds in her ambitious program of achieving world</p>
<p>scientific and engineering supremacy by turning qut vast numbers</p>
<p>of well- trained scientists and engineers. Democracies move |</p>
<p>slower than totalitarian dictatorships. We have let our edugational problem grow much too big for comfort and safety. We are.</p>
<p>beginning to see now that we must solve it without delay.</p>
<p>The theories Qf progressive educationists have left a deep 4mpact which sannot easily be erased. Stung by criticism American educationists are making an effort to shift the entire responsibility for watered-down | curricula on the American public. But the public has now awakened to the need for school 4mprovement while</p>
<p>educationists still erect roadblocks to genuine reform. One has</p>
<p>but to steep himself in the writings of leading educationists to</p>
<p>sense their profound anti-intellectualism and dislike for quality education.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest danger has been our failure to provide adequate educational opportunities for our gifted youth and, in particular, to seek out the talented at an early age and to give them an education which challenges their minds and induces them to become trained professionals. 7</p>
<p>We must remember that democracy is not merely a political and social device to insure that under a popularly elected ee government each citizen may enjoy complete personal freedom,</p>
<p>bounded only by the equal rights of other citizens. It is far §</p>
<p>more than that. Democracy guarantees to the individual freedom and opportunity to develop his mind and character to his maxdmum potential without hindrance from external sources so that he. may put them to use not only for himself but for the community ap well. eas = ; Sometimes we forget democracy is not a matter of rights alone; that it depends for its very life on acceptance of corollary duties. If democracy meant no more than freedom of each citizen to enjoy himself, provided in so doing he harmed ‘no one else, it would be a shabhy creed indeed for the people of a</p>
<p>great country; an uninspiring banner under which to fight the |</p>
<p>enemies of freedom.</p>
<p>ELLE SE Ee ES a rane Seeing aes meer eee: mires</p>
<p>The men who established this nation and who devised the political institutions which have served us 50 well realized that democracy puts heavy obligations upon the citizen. It demands of all of us that we participate wisely in choosing. the «men to. govern us, and it places on those who have special talents the obligation to develop these talents to their fullest, and to apply them in the service of the common good. .</p>
