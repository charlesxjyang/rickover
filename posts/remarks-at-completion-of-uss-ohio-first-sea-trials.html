      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his remarks from June 20, 1981, Admiral Rickover reflects on the successful first sea trials of the 19,000-ton USS Ohio, contrasting its advanced capabilities with the arduous conditions of early submarines, such as 500-ton and 800-ton &quot;O-boats&quot; and &quot;S-boats.&quot; He highlights the primitive nature of early sub life, detailing challenges like precise ballast trimming (e.g., 300 lbs of water for two men, or 7 tons for salinity changes across the Panama Canal), lack of air-conditioning leading to rashes and bed-bugs on 9-day patrols, and the absence of fresh water. Rickover emphasizes the luxury enjoyed by modern submariners with fresh food, ample water, and showers, passing the torch to the Ohio&#x27;s &quot;plank-owners.&quot; He concludes by likening the occasion to St. Crispian&#x27;s Day, referencing Shakespeare&#x27;s *Henry IV*, and commending the crew for a job well done on a vessel destined to be a powerful deterrent.</p>

        <p>DATE - tfai/el</p>
<p>The first sea trials (ro the OHIO have now been completed. The officers and men operated this new type submarine in an exemplary manner - like veterans. I say this from experience in submarines going back more than half a century - from o-boats, s-boats to this one of 19,000 tons. I can remember when, in a 500 ton submerged boat (we called them “boats” at the time) - if two men went from the bow to the stern this would make a difference. As diving officer I would have to shift 300 lbs. Of water from the after to the forward tank - we then figured 150 pounds per man.</p>
<p>Also, we then had what was called the &quot;periscope trim”. The balance was so fine that when we raised or lowered the periscope, we had to take in or pump out a few pounds of water. I also remember the time 1 was assigned to an 800 ton s-boat - at coco solo. We often shifted our operations from the atlantic to the pacific. After transiting the panama canal, we had to take in seven tons</p>
<p>“In salinity of the sea water in the two oceans.</p>
<p>There was no air-conditioning then. When we went on a 9-day patrol , \ iy we were constantly hot - we developed rashes. When we turned in and tried to sleep, we were sc tired that we didn’t bother fighting (off the bed-bugsp and in the upper bunk, the dripping of water that had condensed on the over-head interfered with sleep-and dreams. When we occasionally surfaced after sunset, we brought a bucket of fresh water top-side and took a fresh water bath, sometimes we jumped into the sea</p>
<p>I could tell you more about the early days of submarines, but I will not. When you get to my time of life I can envision all of you sitting at your fireside telling your grand-children about that ancient ship, the OHIO, of which you were a &quot;plank-owner”. So I will stop and let you youngsters carry the torch.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck. I hope you will make full use of the opportunity the navy has given you to lead a worth-while, therefore a happy life. And just imagine - the navy is even paying you for the opportunity of engaging in this interesting work! I AM</p>
<p>“So, you young noblemen in the uhioydo not know how fortunate you ~~</p>
<p>You will well remember</p>
<p>This day - the pay the first TRIDENT submarine - one of</p>
<p>Owerful deterrents to war ~ returned from successful sea trials,</p>
<p>It shoutp remind you of sr, crispian’s day,</p>
<p>Also an eventful day, as shakespeare said then in henry IV:</p>
<p>“This day is called the feast of crispian:</p>
<p>And rouse him at the name of crispian,”</p>
<p>My thanks and the navy's thanks for a job well done,</p>
<p>—; or ae.</p>
