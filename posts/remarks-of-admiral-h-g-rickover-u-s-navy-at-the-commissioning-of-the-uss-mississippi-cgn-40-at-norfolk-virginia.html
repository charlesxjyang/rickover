      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his remarks at the 1978 commissioning of the USS MISSISSIPPI (CGN 40), Admiral H. G. Rickover offers a insightful reflection on the U.S. Presidency, moral leadership, and professional ethics, with specific attention to then-President Jimmy Carter. Rickover recounts Carter&#x27;s formative experience in the Navy&#x27;s nuclear program, including his &quot;outstanding job&quot; during the 1953 Chalk River, Ontario radiation incident. He then delves into the challenging nature of the Presidency as a position of moral teaching, expressing concern over the legal and medical professions&#x27; increasing focus on money over justice, and government officials&#x27; tendency to prioritize business interests. Rickover reinforces his points with timeless wisdom, citing Biblical precepts like &quot;the love of money is the root of all evil,&quot; the perspective of Czar Nicholas I on the burden of rule, and Polonius&#x27;s advice from *Hamlet* to &quot;thine own self be true&quot; as exemplified by Carter&#x27;s principled leadership. He concludes by extending to President Carter what he calls &quot;the highest honor I can bestow&quot;: a standing offer to return to the Naval Reactors Program should he ever leave his current employment.</p>

        <p>Remarks of Admiral H.G. Rickover, U.S, Navy at the Commissioning of the USS MISSISSIPPI (CGN 40) at Norfolk, Virginia Saturday, 5 August 19'78</p>
<p>I am happy that our Commander in Chief is here today,</p>
<p>It is not generally known that in 1953, while he was in the Navy's nuclear program, a radiation incident occurred at the Canadian nuclear . plant’ in Chalk River, Ontario. To obtain experience, I asked the Canadians for permission to send a group of naval personnel to help, Lieutenant Carter was in this group. He did an outstanding job. In the process, he learned much about the practical aspects of nuclear power,</p>
<p>As one might expect, I am interested in his Presidency. That office today is the most difficult one in our history; the ones succeeding it will be even more difficult. It is not merely an administrative office, it is predominantly a place for moral teaching. This is now difficult, : We can no longer look to the legal profession for help, It has become a large powerful group whose major object is money, not justice. The medical profession is catching up with the lawyers. Hence President Carter's hospital cost-control bill to protect the public. Large business is using financial and lobbying power to influence legislation,</p>
<p>Many government officials come from business. Some of them forget that they must serve all of our people; that the welfare of the : people who pay them does not always coincide with the welfare of business and of lawyers. Some of these officials then depart for lucrative jobs in</p>
<p>industry.</p>
<p>The only shared moral consensus we have today is religion, The Bible is replete with wisdom that comes from human experience. Among its precepts are: ''The love of money is the root of all evil, '' and ''For</p>
<p>' where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. '&quot;' Regardless of this age-old wisdom, many of the rich act as if shrouds have pockets.</p>
<p>The public is more critical of those in high office than it has ever been, It is easier to point out the flaws and fallacies of a great man than ‘to be one. Simple and sweeping views are useful only to those who have no responsibility.</p>
<p>Lam sure the President is often reminded of what Czar Nicholas I said: &quot;Not I but 10,000 clerks rule Russia.&quot; Further, that he is merely the senior one of a committee of Czars.</p>
<p>Deep within President Carter is the knowledge that struggle is the law of growth; character is built in the storm and stress of the world; and a man reaches his full height only through compulsions, responsibilisies: and suffering. With the winds of circumstances blowing in so many directions, he knows that the only sure way is to act on principle. He does what his conscience tells him is best for our people and our country. He exemplifies what Polonius said to Laertes:</p>
<p>This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day,</p>
<p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
<p>Because of his outstanding work in the nuclear program, I have</p>
<p>written him that, if at any time in the future he decides to leave his present employment, I will welcome him back into the Naval Reactors Program — subject, of course, to being interviewed once again to determine his qualifications. This is the highest honor I can bestow on anyone.</p>
<p>Mr. President, I will now present you with your record at the</p>
<p>Canadian plant.</p>
