      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This historical hearing centers on H.R. 9328, proposed legislation to provide &quot;continuation incentive pay&quot; for nuclear-qualified submarine officers, directly addressing a critical crisis of rapidly increasing resignations threatening national security. Led by Secretary Hittle, with support from Admirals Rickover and Duncan, the testimony highlights that retention rates for this small, highly specialized group (approximately 1,123 junior officers) have plummeted to below 40%, making the bonus a more cost-effective solution than replacing personnel, with training costs estimated at $124,500 per officer. The proposed pay involves up to $3,750 per year (totaling $15,000 for a 4-year extension), with estimated annual costs of $2.4 million in FY1970 rising to $3.8 million by FY1973, justified by successful precedents like the variable reenlistment bonus for enlisted personnel and physicians. While acknowledging non-monetary factors contributing to resignations (e.g., inadequate sea-shore rotation, long hours, isolated deployments), the bill is presented as an urgent, temporary measure (expiring June 30, 1973) to stabilize the force and is framed as Congressional recognition of their vital service, not merely a monetary transaction.</p>

<p>557</p>
<p>the great record you have as a Marine general, as a combat officer, as a<br>great hero in World War II.</p>
<p>We know your record like a book. We know your dedication. We<br>know the things you have done. We are positive you will justify the<br>reason for your selection as Assistant Secretary for Manpower and<br>Reserve Affairs in the Department of the Navy.</p>
<p>General Hittle, this is a very important piece of legislation; one<br>of the most vital we will take up. You go ahead and present whatever<br>you have to say any way you want it. You will not be interrupted until<br>you have completed your statement.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrrz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I deeply appreciate<br>your kind words, and I will endeavor today, and in the future, to jus-<br>tify this expression of confidence.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Do you agree with Mr. Blanford, that the fourth<br>arm of the service is the Marine Corps? Don’t answer that question.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrim. You will never get an argument out of me on<br>that one, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Go ahead, General.</p>
<p>‘Secretary Hirriun. Thank you.</p>
<p>Before I begin my statement, Mr. Chairman, I would like to pay<br>tribute to the distinguished officers who are accompanying me here<br>today, and demonstrating by their presence the intense interest of the<br>Navy in this vital piece of legislation.</p>
<p>On my right, we are honored to have—I am particularly honored to<br>have beside me Vice Adm. Hyman Rickover, who is the Deputy<br>Commander for Nuclear Propulsion of the Naval Systems Command.<br>He is accompanied by Mr. William Wegner, the Deputy Director<br>of the Division of Naval Reactors of the AEC.</p>
<p>I also know it is not necessary for me to introduce him to you, but<br>I want to pay tribute, also, to Vice Adm. Charles K. Duncan, who<br>is the distinguished Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower<br>and Naval Reserve, and Chief of Naval Personnel. He is accom-<br>panied by one of the outstanding experts in his field, Capt. Charles<br>H. Griffith, who is Program Manager for Nuclear Power in the Per-<br>sonnel Program Management Division.</p>
<p>So at least in my first appearance here, Mr. Chairman, my flanks are<br>well protected. :</p>
<p>The Cuairman. That is a Marine religion, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrix. It isa very good principle, I found, sir.</p>
<p>The Cuairman. Go right ahead, sir.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrie. With respect to my statement, I appear before<br>you in my position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower<br>and Reserve Affairs. I am also representing the Department of De-<br>fense on H.R. 9328.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege to appear before you at this time;<br>particiularly, since it is my first opportunity to do so in my present<br>capacity. This appearance provides me the opprotunity to present to<br>you the proposed legislation which we are convinced is extremely<br>important to our Nation’s security.</p>
<p>The proposal, in essence, involves special pay legislation for a cer-<br>tain category of officers qualified for service in our Nation’s nuclear<br>submarines.</p>
<p>556</p>
<p>after that date, the authority to pay continuation pay to nu<br>qualified submarine officers will thereafter cease.</p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>The Department estimates that enactment of this legislation<br>result in annual costs of approximately $2.4 million in fiscal<br>1970, and gradually increasing thereafter to a high of approxim<br>$3.8 million in fiscal year 1973. :</p>
<p>Tn evaluating the cost of this proposal, I would like to call<br>attention to the fact that the overall training costs for a nu<br>qualified submarine officer who remains to the 8th year of his<br>missioned service is estimated to be approximately $124,500. &quot;<br>if by enactment of this legislation we are able to retain only a<br>more officers in the nuclear submarine program, we will more<br>recoup the moneys that we have expended for continuation pay.</p>
<p>PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH “CONTINUATION PAY”</p>
<p>I would like also to make one final observation. We have {<br>that the variable reenlistment bonus for enlisted personnel \<br>was enacted in 1965, and is very similar to this proposal, has<br>very successful in increasing the retention rate for qualified<br>term reenlistees. :<br>Similarly, the retention rate for physicians on continuatior<br>appears to have substantially improved. CORN:</p>
<p>Therefore, I have no doubt in my mind that this manag<br>device will be singularly successful in the nuclear submarine pre<br>as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am certain that many of you will suggest that pe<br>we ought to amend this legislation to make it apply to other g<br>of officers who may also be in categories which are experie<br>retention difficulties.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, I would consider such an amendment as worthy ¢<br>cussion for possible inclusion in this legislation. However, anal<br>ment of this type, though perhaps meritorious, might, seriously<br>ardize expeditious action on this critically needed legislation. :<br>fore, I would urge the members of this committee to attempt t<br>fine discussion on this bill to whether H.R. 9328 is the best legis<br>approach to the immediate problem of assuring the effective ma<br>of our nuclear submarine fleet.</p>
<p>With this somewhat lengthy explanation of the bill, I p:<br>that. we now hear from our Navy witnesses.</p>
<p>The Cramman. We are going to hear from the new Assistan<br>retary, General Hittle.</p>
<p>The committee knows General Hittle very well. As a matter o<br>when he took his present job he had several assignments wit<br>committee where he was an adviser.</p>
<p>We may be asking you questions sometimes as an adviser and<br>times as Assistant Secretary. So you have to decide where your lo<br>lay. | Laughter. ]</p>

<p>5S)</p>
<p>group, replacement of such officers who resign from this group can-<br>not be made by the transfer of other naval officers immediately into<br>such duty.</p>
<p>Neither can there be a timely remedy of the problem facing us by<br>recruiting and quickly training additional officers with such nuclear<br>submarine qualifications, The reason why this can’t be done is obvious.<br>The long formal school and shipboard training process precludes any<br>such rapid solution. And, also, large scale recruiting of such officers<br>simply cannot be achieved on a “crash” basis because of the high stand-<br>ards of required educational achievement.</p>
<p>The basic career concept for nuclear submarine officers provides for<br>an initial sea tour of about 3 years upon completion of training. (The<br>initial training period approaches 2 years in length, including both<br>nuclear power and submarine training.)</p>
<p>After the first sea tour, an officer ideally should go to a shore, staff,<br>or postgraduate educational assignment. The next sea assignment then<br>would be as one of three department heads in a Polaris or attack sub-<br>marine. Because of prerequisite training and sea experience, a nuclear<br>submarine department head should be an officer of 5-9 years’ naval<br>service. This is the specific group about which we are talking at this<br>time.</p>
<p>At this point, I think I should mention that the total number of<br>nuclear submarine officers has always been insufficient to permit a<br>desirable normal sea-shore rotation of duty. Thus, it is not unusual<br>today to find a nuclear submarine commanding officer with as much<br>as 18 years of continuous sea duty, unbroken by shore assignments<br>save for short periods of technical training. However, in spite of such<br>conditions, we&#x27;ve had in the past a retention rate of over 75 percent<br>of such especially qualified nuclear submarine officers.</p>
<p>As the nuclear submarine fleet grew larger, however, and additional<br>newly commissioned officers for such duty were brought into the nu-<br>clear submarine program, the Navy did anticipate some decline in<br>retention.</p>
<p>But, frankly, Mr. Chairman, we did not anticipate the virtual flood<br>of resignations which has recently developed, and which has dropped<br>the projected retention rate of junior nuclear submarine officers to less<br>than 40 percent. We expect to be hit by the full impact of these losses<br>beginning in the next fiscal year—fiscal year 1970—which begins next<br>July 1.</p>
<p>The causes of these resignations, as has been determined by surveys<br>and personal interviews with the officers submitting the resignations,<br>are:</p>
<p>a. Pessimism regarding the opportunity for reasonable sea-shore<br>rotation, advanced education assignments, and other career-<br>broadening tours.</p>
<p>b, Inadequate home life resulting from frequent totally-isolated<br>deployments, with little relief from repetition of such deployment.</p>
<p>c. Lhe extremely long hours to maintain the high performance<br>standards required to ensure reactor, nuclear weapons, and<br>submarine safety and mission success; with the inherent close<br>supervision by all echelons of commands, detailed direction and<br>procedural standardization, and exacting personnel qualification<br>requirements,</p>
<p>98—066—69—No. 7 2</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>This proposed legislation, Mr. Chairman, would amend tit!<br>United States Code. It would provide special pay for those subm<br>officers who have additionally the techniqual qualification for<br>involving supervision, operation, and maintenance of the N<br>nuclear propulsion plants. Those officers who would receive the<br>posed special pay would, in turn, remain on active duty servic<br>4 years beyond obligated service. ‘</p>
<p>Why is this legislation so urgent? &#x27;The reason, Mr. Chairman<br>very simple one. The Navy is faced with a rapidly increasing re<br>resignations by qualified nuclear submarine officers. The rate at‘<br>the resignations are being submitted confronts the Navy with ai<br>mediate problem of manning with’ qualified personnel the nv<br>submarines which are so vital to our security.</p>
<p>Also, in addition to having the necessary number of officers<br>able for the highly responsible and specialized assignments in nu<br>submarines, there must be an adequate number to provide for rot<br>for nuclear submarine officers between sea and shore duty. Th<br>vance of nuclear technology, as well as the career patterns o<br>officers concerned, requires that they be available for postgra<br>educational study ashore.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Right here, let me interrupt.</p>
<p>I want the record to show a quorum is present, so when we app<br>this bill, proxies, under the rules, will be in order.</p>
<p>Go right ahead, sir.</p>
<p>Secretary Hirriz. Because of the present shortage of officers,<br>at the present time, the plain hard fact of the matter is that a desi<br>proportion of such officers are not available for postgraduate s</p>
<p>The rate at which resignations have been and are being rece<br>to be effective upon completion of currently obligated service, 1<br>inescapably to the fact that unless remedial action is taken pron<br>there will be not only a further shortage of officers for shore<br>rotation and postgraduate work, but the shortage is going to inc<br>in the group of officers—and it is a small one—who are qualified fi<br>key technical assignments for submarines. In other words, Mr. C<br>man, the present shortage of personnel generates resignations, 1<br>in turn generates more resignations, and the problem feeds on |</p>
<p>The Navy is well aware that this committee fully appreciate<br>capability of the nuclear submarine and knows that it 1s the hee<br>the Polaris-Posiedon strategic system and a vital element in our<br>submarine warfare capability.</p>
<p>I am confident, Mr. Chairman, that I need not belabor the<br>before this committee that any such situation that impairs our a<br>to man properly our nuclear submarines could have a serious ad<br>effect on our national security.</p>
<p>Actually the number of officers involved in the proposed legisl:<br>and who would receive the special nuclear submarine pay is s<br>The projected total is 1,123 such officers, Of these, almost all are 1<br>grade of lieutenant. ; ae :</p>
<p>This group, Mr. Chairman, is small, but it is critically impor<br>The officers in this group possess unusual educational qualifica<br>Also, their long specialized training in nuclear submarine exper<br>makes them a clearly identifiable group of naval officers. Becav<br>their small number and the qualifications which are unique tc</p>

<p>part of our Nation’s defense, are manned by, officers who are uniquely<br>qualified by education, training, and experience.to take these ships<br>down. into the sea where they are the roving underwater guardians of<br>our Nation’s safety.</p>
<p>There is one point, Mr, Chairman, which I want. to make perfectly<br>clear to this committee. The Navy is not. going to say to you that these<br>vitally necessary nuclear submarines are not going to go to sea. These<br>ships, under any personnel circumstances, will go to sea.</p>
<p>We hope that they will go to sea without having to employ admin-<br>istrative “press gang” methods.</p>
<p>It is for that reason that we urge favorable adoption of this legisla-<br>tion. It is not a desirable kind of legislation, but it is necessary. It is<br>required not by theory, but by an actual condition. It is necessary from<br>the standpoint of our national security.</p>
<p>That concludes my statement, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Cuatrrman. Mr. Secretary, we are approaching this problem<br>from a money standpoint strictly. How do we know this will not create<br>a morale problem among other echelons of the Navy? And how did you<br>arrive at the $3,750? How did you arrive at the 10 years? Why not<br>12 years?</p>
<p>These are lots of questions.</p>
<p>Now, there are a lot of new members of this committee who may not<br>know you have two crews for every nuclear submarine, one ashore and<br>one at sea, or aboard some place. ;</p>
<p>How do we know you are not going to have to let up a little bit on<br>the constant training? You may have to get three crews. We don’t<br>know what the eventuality of this emergency will be, and this is an<br>emergency.</p>
<p>The thing that disturbs me more than anything is these are the<br>young officers, the 10-year crowd, in that 10-year group, from which<br>will come our future great leaders that we are to have. They are the<br>junior people on whom we must build.</p>
<p>This is a vital and a serious question. It needs all the brains at your<br>command. It needs everything Admiral Rickover can do.</p>
<p>We don’t have 1,900 Rickovers running around the Navy who don’t<br>mind working 24 hours a day. They don’t make people like this. We<br>can’t. work these people to death. We may be doing this.</p>
<p>These submarines, which is a product of the greatest minds in the<br>history of the world—the people such as Admiral Rickover and<br>Admiral Duncan and the rest of you, have convened, have built the<br>best things of our handiwork. You are trying to keep ahead of the rest<br>of the world.</p>
<p>You know, we know what is going on in Russia, an assembly line of<br>these things. I don’t know the quality of them, but I know they are<br>coming. This is the most vital thing we can do, because if we have a<br>deterrent, these Polaris submarines are, and these attack submarines<br>are. These are the things that are worrying us.</p>
<p>Let’s address yourself to the first question I asked: Why this $3,750,<br>why the 10 years? Will there be another morale question? Explore<br>some of the things you can explore to us on top of the table.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrie. First I would like to say to you in all frankness,<br>Mr. Chairman, we are not sitting at this table and telling you that</p>
<p>this is a guaranteed solution.</p>
<p>560</p>
<p>d. The feeling that the monetary compensation is not commenst<br>rate with the demands of the job, particularly in comparison wit<br>civilians doing similar work, and the growing demand for skille<br>and experienced engineers in the etvillan sector. be</p>
<p>We have examined other measures which, if the emergency d<br>velops as along the lines now apparent, will have to be adopted to kee<br>the nuclear ships at sea, under conditions with the benefit of th<br>proposed legislation.</p>
<p>Such measures include the partial manning of these technical]<br>specialized and powerful nuclear submarines with officers that hiay<br>not been trained for nuclear submarine duty. The problem with th:<br>short-range solution is that eventually we might be faced with a<br>actual shortage of executive and commanding officers with nucles<br>power qualifications.</p>
<p>Also, if necessity so dictates, there will be no choice but to continu<br>on sea duty such nuclear-trained officers as are available for suc<br>duty. This in turn, will mean the virtual elimination of a large portio<br>of shore assignments. Obviously, such action would have the furthe<br>inescapable effect of compounding one of the very conditions that ‘<br>producing the resignations among these nuclear submarine officer</p>
<p>Such measures would result in lowering morale, further decreasin<br>the nuclear submarine training base and reducing the overall cap:<br>bilities of such nuclear submarine crews. As such, these would not k<br>solutions.</p>
<p>They would be, at best, poor expedients.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Chairman, the Navy believes that the most promisin<br>solution lies in the voluntary retention of larger numbers of the traine<br>and experienced officers currently on board our nuclear submarine<br>This will make possible eventually the attainment of the improve<br>career patterns which we know are needed. Not only is this, in ou<br>opinion, the most effective course, but it is by far the most economi<br>both monetarily and in use of scarce talent.</p>
<p>Consequently, Mr. Chairman, it is because of the above consider<br>tions that the Department of Defense asks authorization for a. speci:<br>continuation incentive pay for nuclear-trained submarine officers ¢<br>department head seniority, who are completing their minimum obl<br>gated service within the next few years. :</p>
<p>This would provide for payment of up to $3,750 per year to eac<br>eligible officer who agrees to obligate himself for an additional<br>years’ service in nuclear submarines. Such incentive pay would n¢<br>only have direct monetary impact, it is most important, in my opis<br>ion, that this legislation would constitute official and public recogn<br>tion and appreciation by the Congress, and through it the Nation, c<br>the importance of this group of nuclear submarine officers.</p>
<p>If the proposed legislation is enacted, the cost for fiscal year 1970-<br>the first year of the proposal—would be $2.4 million.</p>
<p>I might point out and emphaize this is not a slip of the tongue.<br>am not talking in billions, I am talking in terms of $2.4 million, M<br>Chairman.</p>
<p>Such cost for retaining trained nuclear submarine officers is e:<br>tremely small in terms of our Nation’s multibillion-dollar investmer<br>in nuclear submarines. Also, such cost is extremely small in terms c<br>helping assure that our nuclear submarines, which form such a vit:</p>
<p>J</p>
<p>»,</p>
<p>563</p>
<p>Are there any questions by any members of the committee?</p>
<p>Mr. Price?</p>
<p>Mr. Price. Mr. Chairman, I want to say at the outset that I am<br>strongly in support of this proposed bill. I have been aware of this<br>problem for some time.</p>
<p>T do note in your statement, Mr. Secretary, you list four main reasons<br>why you are confronted with this problem of reservations. You placed<br>the monetary one fourth in that listing. : : :</p>
<p>In my experience, in talking with some men who are in this service,<br>they do seem to place their greatest—they place these other problems<br>you listed first as their areas of greatest concern.</p>
<p>What are you going to do about those areas ?</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrix. I would like Admiral Duncan to respond to that,<br>because much has been done and is being done under his immediate<br>direction. —</p>
<p>Mr. Prices. I am not against the monetary thing, I think that is im-<br>portant too. But everyone that has ever talked to me, they place these<br>other things as the areas of their greatest personnel concern.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. I think they try to tell us in this statement, they are<br>addressing themselves to these problems. But go ahead and answer<br>the question. :</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Yes, Mr. Price, we are looking all across the board<br>at the things we can do to give these officers a better career. :</p>
<p>One of the things we are trying to do is to take some of the terrible<br>administrative burden off of these officers, to take some of the workload<br>off of them when they come into port, by various means—by staging<br>the qualifications required, that is, not to have the officer have to<br>qualify in nuclear weapons, as navigator, officer deck, in subma-<br>rines, and powerplant all at once. ; ;</p>
<p>We are trying to stage the inspections which are a great burden on<br>them. a</p>
<p>Weare trying to increase the recognition of these officers.</p>
<p>One rather simple thing that might be effective, there has been a<br>Polaris pin authorized. We are trving to have our Chief of Informa-<br>tion publicize just how important these people are to the country.</p>
<p>These are some of the things. oe</p>
<p>I would add, Mr. Price, that although the monetary reason is listed<br>lower, we are depending a great deal on our experience with the<br>variable reenlistment bonus which this committee authorized. It has<br>produced really very substantial improvements in critical areas, and<br>so we are predicting, and hoping, of course, that if this legislation is<br>passed that it will produce similar results.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. Mr. Chairman, I think your summary of your statement<br>is very important too. I certainly wouldn’t want to even consider of-<br>fering amendments here to delay consideration of this bill. :</p>
<p>But the concern in those first, a, b, c’s are also concerns of enlisted<br>personnel. ; ‘ :</p>
<p>Are you also taking into consideration adjustments in those areas?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Yes, we are. : :</p>
<p>The reenlistment, first term reenlistment of men in the submarines,<br>has held up very well. It has fallen off very slightly, but it is stall<br>holding up very well.</p>
<p>562</p>
<p>On the basis of the long study that has been conducted, the<br>views with these officers concerned, and particularly in this age |<br>which you have identified as such an important element to the |<br>of the Navy and the nuclear submarine program, the figure tha<br>arrived at was considered a reasonable approach to the retentio<br>incentive pay situation.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Based on your experience with the enlisted<br>retention pay, you think that is true?</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrix. This has been related to that experience als<br>Chairman. We hope it will be a complete solution. We can’t mal<br>guarantees.</p>
<p>We feel on the basis of the interviews that we have had with<br>officers, that it is going to aproach being a satisfactory, although<br>ably not a complete solution.</p>
<p>And yet there is one thing that is very important in this that ]<br>to emphasize: This incentive bonus is not putting the service ai<br>devotion of these officers concerned upon the marketplace blo:<br>dollars per hour.</p>
<p>In a real sense, this is a recognition by the Congress and |<br>country of the unusual qualifications of these officers, and the ap<br>ation of the Congress and the country for the unique services<br>type of duty which they are performing.</p>
<p>I want to make it very clear it is not a matter of simply buyir<br>cers with an increased and temporary monetary incentive.</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. We are not here this morning to criticize wh<br>been done in the past, but keeping a man in for 14 years. We ar<br>to help you solve a problem that is vital.</p>
<p>I am not going to tolerate any questions going to the point 01<br>cizing the Navy in certain policies they have had. We are ata<br>of decision.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrriz. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>: The Cuarrman. We can’t have any more 14 years without<br>duty.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve got to have a regular program, Admiral Duncan. And -<br>got to convene the finest brains you have to give these people :<br>portunity to get their views before you. You have a problem<br>voice is the only voice you have. We have to help you in this pr<br>This is how simple it is.</p>
<p>You stand to lose 400 people right away, out of 1,900. That 1<br>simple it is. You can see what will happen to your submarine prc<br>with the Poseidon coming up over the horizon, with all the soy<br>cation that weapon system possesses. And then you’ve got to kee<br>nuclear submarine that Admiral Rickover gave us, with new thi<br>the offing, new things right around the corner. We have to keer<br>with the dedication he has given us. And it is a practical applic</p>
<p>Iam going to ask the committee to confine your questions comy<br>to this bill. We can’t afford to wander off on anything. We wil<br>until we get the higher echelon of the DOD. I want to confin<br>this bill.</p>
<p>We have to get this bill out this morning. This is vital. So I a<br>going to take up any more time.</p>
<p>You know what the bill contains, gentlemen. You have he<br>very capably, very aptly, very expertly explained. We’ve got t<br>them. That is how simple it is.</p>
<p>J</p>
<p>565</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. I would like to ask Captain Griffiths to give you<br>the exact number.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. I think the record should show this.</p>
<p>Captain Grirrrrus. Almost all the officers on board would have that<br>qualification, We would have a supply officer and medical officer that<br>would not have it, but in most cases, in most cases, all of the other<br>officers would have that qualification.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. What percentage, say ?</p>
<p>Captian Grirrrrus. Ninety-eight percent, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Ninety-eight percent would get this, 2 percent wouldn’t?.</p>
<p>Captain Grierrrus. No, sir; that is not quite correct.</p>
<p>The executive officer and the captain would not get this; that is, the<br>plan is aimed at the junior officers, at the younger officers.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Just the junior officers. But among the junior officers 98<br>percent would get it and 2 percent wouldn’t ?</p>
<p>Captain Grirrirus. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. That wouldn’t create a possible moral factor?</p>
<p>Mr. Suattnsuex. Mr. Bray, if I may interrupt at this point. This is<br>somewhat analogous to the reenlistment bonus which is payable to the<br>first term enlistees. It isn’t paid to the older men as they go along.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Furthermore, this does not apply to your nonnuclear<br>submarines?</p>
<p>_ Admiral Duncan. That is correct.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. None of those would have this bonus?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. This is for officers trained and qualified in nuclear<br>power—submarine officers.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. This could take place prior to 10 years, is that right?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. They must obligate themselves</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. But here it says they must not have completed their 10<br>years.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. That is correct.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. They might finish 6 to 7?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. After you have this, say, at 6 years, and you add this 4<br>years, at 10 years you have no right to give him any additional bonus by<br>this legislation, have you?</p>
<p>Admiral Dunoan. Not under this legislation.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Then, as far as that is concerned, the same position would<br>be he would be in the same position if he never had that. In fact, worse,<br>because he would take a bust after this 4 years had gone. He would reach<br>10 vears, he would start getting less bonus.</p>
<p>Would that especially help his morale?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. We don’t look at it from that viewpoint. We look<br>at it from the viewpoint</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Tam not stating viewpoint, I am just stating facts.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. We hope this will make the inventory such that<br>the community will be healthy, we will have a healthy nuclear powered<br>submarine community, and this bonus may not be required after that.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. You will not need it for him for the second 4 years? You<br>don’t mean to keep this up forever?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. This is a one-time payment.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. I have no criticism of what you are doing, but I do believe<br>the record ought to show this is not a panacea for all your problems.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. We would agree.</p>
<p>O64</p>
<p>Part of this is because of these very highly skilled men in<br>marines. A high proportion do receive the extra variable reenlist<br>bonus and the proficiency pay.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. I hear from various enlisted personnel. Mainly<br>complain about limited liberty, even when they are in port.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. The working time, or working day in pc<br>indeed very difficult, both for the officers and for the men, and<br>mentioned, we are going to try to get some assistance in the mainter<br>area, attaching men to tenders; that is one of the ways we wil<br>proach this.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. The Navy is aware of the problem. They are awa:<br>the concern of the men themselves, and they are attempting t<br>something to relieve these conditions ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Yes, Mr. Price. But I would say the reenlist:<br>rate, first term reenlistment rate of the enlisted men in the subma:<br>today so far is holding up very well in the nuclear submarine |<br>munity.</p>
<p>The Cramman. Don’t let’s have a reaction psychosis. Let’s ar<br>pate these things.</p>
<p>Mr. Buanprorp. Give the reason, Admiral.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. Particularly in this case, I wouldn’t want all the m<br>the service to feel we are just taking care of, at this time, just one<br>of the submarine service.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Some of the reasons that the reenlistment rat<br>the enlisted men has held up so well, are as I mentioned, we ha<br>very high proportion of highly skilled enlisted men. They are tl<br>fore qualified for the variable reenlistment bonus and the profici<br>pay, and therefore we have really a much higher reenlistment<br>than we do in the rest of the Navy asa whole.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. That is all T have, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Cramman. Mr. Bray.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, if we have a lot of questions, we have to confine ourse<br>to the 5-minute rule, but Iam not going to do it at this time.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. E have very few questions.</p>
<p>First, I am satisfied that legislation of this kind is necessary.</p>
<p>T also am aware from other experiences had, when you start gi<br>officers of the same rank and time, different pay, you open Pand<br>box. But I can’t see any other solution. |</p>
<p>I guess you gentlemen have worked at it a good while. Appare<br>you haven’t either or you would have proposed it. In the end, let’:<br>kid ourselves, this is not good.</p>
<p>I think the record ought to show a few things here on this matte</p>
<p>One, on number 3, in the bill, it says “has the current techr<br>qualification for duty in connection with supervision, operation,<br>maintenace of naval nuclear propulsion plants.”</p>
<p>Now, what percent of the officers on board the submarine wi<br>have that qualification under paragraph 3?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. We would like to have 11, on each submarir</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Have what?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Eleven.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Eleven.</p>
<p>How many officers would you have on the submarine?</p>
<p>567</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Lieutenant. We are addressing, of course, the</p>
<p>) nuclear submarine community.</p>
<p>SA</p>
<p>Mr. Srrarron. This, I gather, you have in mind, a temporary plan.<br>This is a temporary plan, not a permanent plan ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Mr. Stratton, this is a plan which we hope will<br>produce results, and as you may have noted in the legislation, it does<br>expire at a set date. This particular legislation.</p>
<p>We would hope by the time it has operated for 4 years, we would<br>have had a very definite improvement in the submarine nuclear-<br>powered community. If not, we will look at other methods, perhaps<br>come back to the committee.</p>
<p>I would hope between now and then that through all of the attacks<br>we are making on the program, that we would have a good viable<br>nuclear submarine program.</p>
<p>Mr. Srrarton. The thing I am worried about is the same thing that<br>Mr. Bray has referred to. I am afraid of what is going to happen to a<br>man when he has completed this 9 years, and then reverts back to his<br>salary without the $3,700 a year extra.</p>
<p>Have you, as your experience—has your experience been with these<br>officers in contrast with the enlisted men, they are going to be so career<br>committed when they are nuclear trained and have all these oppor-<br>tunities, as Admiral Rickover is well aware, in General Electric and<br>Westinghouse, and so on, are they going to be willing to stay in at a<br>reduced rate of pay ?</p>
<p>Maybe they will get a promotion at that point which might end<br>them up with almost a breakeven point. But I can visualize that a man<br>might reach this point where he would find suddenly that his reenlist-<br>ment bonus had run out, and he was being asked to stay on in the grade<br>of commander and captain at a lower rate of pay.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrrin. Mr. Stratton, Admiral Rickover has interviewed<br>and spoken with a large number of these people, and I would like him<br>to respond to that also, in addition to Admiral Duncan, if he will.</p>
<p>The Curran. Before we do, though, Mr. Stratton. These men are<br>getting old. They won’t be in these submarines forever. In the mean-<br>time they will be getting additional pay raises. In the meantime there<br>will be other benefits open to these people. These people aren’t going<br>to retrogress, they are going to progress.</p>
<p>You have younger people in this thing, you are not’ going to have<br>one submariner forever sitting aboard that ship of this same vintage<br>of 1900. They will go to other areas. If they decide to leave, money is<br>not going to keep them after this.</p>
<p>Let the expert answer. Go ahead, Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Thank you for calling me an expert in this<br>particular group of Congressmen,</p>
<p>The Crarrman. I am just confining it to that group down there,<br>not up here. | Laughter. ]</p>
<p>Go ahead, Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>_ Admiral Rickover. Mr. Chairman, you should realize our problem<br>1s only with this limited group of a small number of officers.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. That is right.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We do not have large numbers of resignations<br>from senior people. -</p>
<p>566</p>
<p>Mr. Buanprorp. Also, Mr. Bray, during that period of time, h<br>then be receiving a higher pay. : ae</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Then your inputs are right behind it all the</p>
<p>Mr. Buanprorp. The whole objective is to get the people at<br>point where they are going to make up their mind whether the<br>going to stay or leave. If they will agree to stay for $15,000, 1<br>really isn’t $15,000, since there is.a tax hability. | pee</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. For instance, what I was thinking, it might be |<br>if you were not to give it until he reached the 10th year, or abow<br>time, because there is a period in there, at least, that you would<br>the best period that you have to get him to be retrained. He gets s<br>he wants to stay on for retirement usually.</p>
<p>Mr. Branvrorp. The variable reenlistment bonus has work<br>well because it is applicable only to the first reenlistment. ‘This<br>point where these young men have to make up their mind whethe:<br>are going to stay with the Navy or leave the Navy. That is why |<br>geared to this exact point. ;</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. I remembered that, Mr. Blandford, that is the rea<br>wanted this in the record. That is why they went into that in<br>detail.</p>
<p>You have shown the time that you believe is the most impc<br>to get him to remain in the service? : :</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. That is where the problem lies today, ir<br>group. :</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. You would say it is the period before 10 years. I nor<br>thought it might be that period from 10 to 14 years.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. It is the period when these young men ¥<br>department heads, in this general time frame. We do believe that<br>they have stayed that long, just as in the variable reenlistment |<br>that they will then be career-committed, and will stay on for a<br>in the Navy.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. It will run up, then, to 15-plus years.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. You have given this</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. 12-plus, anyway. :</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. You have the right at the time, what you took int<br>sideration was the time you believe, from your study, and past e<br>ence, with other legislation along this line, is the best time to encc<br>him to stay ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Yes, and that is where the problem lies.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. Thank you.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Those are very good questions, Mr. Bray-<br>good. You brought out some important points.</p>
<p>Mr. Bennerr. No questions.</p>
<p>The Cuatrman, Mr. Stratton.</p>
<p>Mr. Srratron. Mr. Chairman, could I ask another question<br>that same line Mr. Bray had, that disturbed me too.</p>
<p>It was my impression we were losing officers in the grade of ¢<br>and commander. Is that not the case? You are losing them m<br>what, heutenant and lieutenant commander grades ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Yes, we are losing them in the lieutenant<br>Mr. Stratton.</p>
<p>Mr. Srrarron. A man who has been in for 10 years, or you se<br>period from 5 to 9, would be roughly at what rank, then ?</p>

<p>and in sub-<br>eee A Ee aaltar, that they were subjected</p>
<p>568</p>
<p>It might interest you to know, in approximately 20 years:<br>program, there have only been. 200 nuclear trained officers altc<br>who have left the Navy—in 20 years.</p>
<p>And the reason this is a problem today, is not because of the x<br>itself, but where the resignations take place. The resignations :<br>taking place among the commanders and captains. But it is<br>the young ones we have the resignations. We take people in wh<br>gate themselves for 4 years or so. Many of them entering the pr<br>have made up their minds at the time they enter that they are not<br>to stay in the Navy.</p>
<p>I would say a minimum of 50 percent, during the interviews<br>cate they are not sure they will make a career of the Navy.</p>
<p>We were faced, when this trend started several years ago, w<br>problem that if a young man said he was not convinced he was<br>to stay in the Navy and make it his career, should we accept. hit<br>found at that point that if we adhered to a practice of that ki<br>would hardly get anyone.</p>
<p>So we decided to take them—we don’t question their career n<br>tion any more—we take them regardless, knowing that about<br>cent might get out. We thought by giving them training, by d<br>ing upon patriotism and love of country—these are obsolete<br>now, they are archaic terms—but we still try to promote that ;<br>the Navy, and in the rest of the armed services—we thought n<br>them would stay in. In fact, more are staying in than I antic</p>
<p>it may also surprise you to learn that the rate of resignation<br>nuclear submarines is less than from conventional submarine:<br>less than among the aviators. And it is less, even with the<br>figures you are getting, it is still less than you are getting in t<br>of the Navy.</p>
<p>But we are only dealing here with a small group of people, :<br>a loss here cannot be spread over large numbers. That is w<br>bonus is confined to the place where it hurts. We hope, throu;<br>means, that it will induce there young men to stay. They are.<br>Many of them are recently married, and their wives read the (<br>politan magazine and they find out that “togetherness” is a<br>thing.

<p>Admiral Ricxover. They also don’t realize, just because the<br>bor’s husband comes home at 4:30 in the afternoon, and they<br>that their wives may actually be proud of them.</p>
<p>One problem you have here: One young officer said to me, bu<br>just 3 days too old to get this bonus. So I said, well, that’s nc<br>fault, it is your parents fault. They were too precipitous. If th<br>waited 3 more days, it would have been worth $5,000 a day 1<br>You can’t help that. You get into questions of that kind all ove</p>

<p>To answer your question, What is going to be their attitude 1:<br>when they lose this pay? As the chairman said, they will mea<br>have been promoted. Their pay will have been increased. They :<br>going to get hurt. This is a great benefit.</p>
<p>I have working in my office, and I have had for many years,<br>large number of people who have received more pay than I ha<br>that hasn’t hurt me any. Every time you start anything new</p>
<p>y</p>
<p>&#x27;</p>
<p>ofl</p>
<p>Mr. Icrorp. Mr. Chairman, I think the language, beginning at line</p>
<p>_A15, should be clarified as to what the meaning is.</p>
<p>tion to all other compensation to which he is entitled, be paid a sum of money<br>not to exceed $3,750 for each year of the active-service agreement. The Secretary<br>of the Navy shall determine Semiannually the necessity for continuance of the<br>special pay and the rate of special pay per year for such active-service agree-<br>ments accepted within each six-month period.</p>
<p>I think we should have some clarification of that language. This<br>appears to me to be. giving the Secretary the authority to juggle the<br>amounts that would be required in each case, and perhaps even stop<br>the pay once it has been granted.</p>
<p>I don’t understand the meaning of that language.</p>
<p>The Cuarman. Let Mr. Slatinshek.</p>
<p>Mr. Icuorp. I want clarification, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Cuamman. Mr. Slatinshek will give it to you. He has to have<br>this discretionary authority. ‘ ;</p>
<p>Mr. Statinsunx. I will give you my interpretation of the language,<br>Mr. Ichord, and if the witnesses disagree with me I would like them<br>to correct me. ; :</p>
<p>The assence of the language relates to new contracts which are being<br>issued, and each 6-month period the Secretary takes a look at the<br>amounts in the contract; that is, whether it should be $3,7 50 a year,<br>whether it should be something less than that. This is a policy across<br>the board.</p>
<p>Mr. Buanprorp. Not those already executed.</p>
<p>Mr. Suatiwsumx. New contracts. ;</p>
<p>So, in effect, it is a statutory requirement he look at this program<br>every 6 months and reassess it on the amount that should be provided.</p>
<p>Is that correct ?</p>
<p>_ The Cuamman. Is this understood?<br>~ Admiral Duncan. Yes. : a :</p>
<p>If I may add, we thought this was a wise provision, again parallel-<br>ing the variable reenlistment bonus where the condition. is assessed,<br>and the Secretary—and you gave the authority to the Secretary of<br>Defense in ‘the other case—where the program was needed to continue,<br>it would. Tt gave him discretionary authority, not to change the con-<br>tract made, though. : ,</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. It is discretional reappraisal and a review. Across<br>the board. :</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>&#x27; Mr. Starinsupx. It has no retroactive effect on the contracts pre-<br>viously entered into. Those would continue under the initial terms<br>established. ;</p>
<p>Mr. Srrarron. Might this mean somebody might get $3,700, some<br>might get $3,000, some might get $2,000 ? : :</p>
<p>Mr. Srattnsuex. It could occur, if the problem is sufficiently<br>alleviated. 2</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. In the time frame, but not at the same time,</p>
<p>The Cuamman. Mr, Ichord, you see, he would have to have some<br>leeway. He would have to have that, because you have that reenlist-</p>
<p>j</p>
<p>_) ment bonus.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrrx. That is correct.</p>
<p>sae)</p>
<p>to what they call, I remember one man phrased it “inhuma<br>quisitions and third degrees,” ‘and “rigid and inhuman demand<br>unreasonable perfection were made on them,” and that “these<br>demands as interpreted by asingle man.”</p>
<p>They felt that they weren’t respected ag individuals, One man<br>me the story. He said, “In my interview, my college record was |<br>reviewed. I had all A’s and one B. The person interviewing me<br>because you got that one B, you are a disgrace to your country.<br>said, “I’m not going to take that kind of talk. That is the reason<br>out of the nuclear program.”</p>
<p>This happened in four cases with me. I merely wanted the re<br>to show it. You can interpret it for whatever value it may have.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. We are not going into any incriminations he</p>
<p>Mr. Gupser. I am just stating facts.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. We can’t tell about personalities, You have per<br>alities; one man interprets it one way; another man will interpr<br>another way.</p>
<p>These submarines require the highest of skill, the greatest of dec<br>tion, everlasting the requirement to be on duty. And those who<br>most familiar with this program, Admiral Duncan knows, that t<br>submarines require people always to be available. This is somet]<br>over which we have no control.</p>
<p>But I think the N avy is addressing themselves to a problem, I }<br>had all kinds of questions from all sorts of people. I heard the s<br>thing about SAC. People talking about. what you had to do to S<br>That is why I don’t want—if you had a few dents on the wing o:<br>airplane, after you went back to headquarters you went through<br>inquisition, all sorts of things like that.</p>
<p>We are faced with a practical, pragmatic problem here now,<br>we&#x27;ve got to be pragmatic people. We have just got to do it.</p>
<p>Mr. Gubser, of course [ recognize we can’t wander off into tl<br>areas, We have just got to get this bill out and do the best we<br>with it.</p>
<p>Mr. Ichord.</p>
<p>Mr. Icnorp. Mr, Chairman, I certainly sympathize and favor<br>objectives of this bill, but I feel that we should look it over y<br>closely, because there are certainly other areas in the service wh<br>similar problems occur, we are faced with similar problems, ma:<br>not as serious as the submarine service,</p>
<p>1am wondering if the old adage that “N, othing is as good as it see<br>beforehand” is not applicable here, Admiral Rickover, particularly<br>regard to this officer who is 3 days too old. How much discontentm:<br>are you going to create in his mind ?</p>
<p>You’ve got to remember everything is relative. Here is a man givi<br>10 years of his life to dedicated service. And T reiterate, everythi<br>is relative there,</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. I believe he is staying on.</p>
<p>Mr. Icuorp. True, he is not going to be hurt.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovrr. You have to draw the line somewhere, unl<br>you want to increase everybody, or give everybody a $15,000 bonus.</p>
<p>Then you get into the proposition, the other services will want tl<br>$15,000 for everyone in their organizations,</p>
<p>The need is this small group, and not in the others.</p>
<p>y,</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>573</p>
<p>Did you have a question ?</p>
<p>Mr. Wurre. Yes, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Yes, Mr. White.</p>
<p>Mr. Wuire. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask just one question,<br>just for my own understanding.</p>
<p>You say over in the second page, “pay not to exceed $3,750 per<br>year.” The top of the third page, you say that he can be paid in five<br>yearly installments not to exceed $3,000 per year.</p>
<p>If the inducement is to pay him the money, why not pay each year<br>the $8,750 ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. The idea of putting the option in there of elect-<br>ing to receive the $3,000 amount over 5 years, it was felt to be an ad-<br>vantage if the man would commit himself 1 year in advance at the<br>time that he could leave the service, if you follow me.</p>
<p>The total amount would be the same, and he would be commit-<br>ting himself, which would permit us to do better officer personnel<br>planning.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrr. Does he have to do it within 1 year? Can he do it, say,<br>within a month of his termination ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. He can make this election any time within—<br>until he comes up to the end of his obligated service, is that correct?<br>Do we have any cutoff on that?</p>
<p>We intended to put a 6 months’ cutoff.</p>
<p>Mr. Wutrr. Then you are paying him after he gets out of the serv-<br>ice, then, if he elects not to go beyond his 4 years?</p>
<p>_ Admiral Duncan. I’m sorry that I did not understand that ques-<br>tion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrer. Do I understand you correctly—maybe I don’t under-<br>stand it.</p>
<p>It appears to me by not paying him the full $3,700, as your maxi-<br>mum, and if he should elect to go into additional 4 years within, say,<br>a week of his termination of his time, then you’ve got an overlap<br>there which you are having to pay him.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. The only way which he can elect the $3,000 pay-<br>ment is that he commits himself in advance before he is eligible to<br>leave the service at all. It is merely a device to give us a longer plan-<br>ning factor for a group who might elect it. If he elects it to begin at<br>the end of his obligated service he would normally get. $3,750 only.<br>He cannot at that point elect $3,000 for 5 years.</p>
<p>Mr. SuavinsHex. If I may interrupt.</p>
<p>Ordinarily these contracts envision that the payment will be made<br>to the member after he has completed his obligated service, and during<br>each of the 4 years that he ‘has extended.</p>
<p>However, as an added inducement, they wanted statutory authority<br>to permit beginning the payment a year earlier, in the instance of a<br>young man who made the decision a year earlier.</p>
<p>Therefore, he would get, instead of $3,750 a year, he would get the<br>same $15,000 lump-sum payment spread over 5 years rather than 4.</p>
<p>This has an obvious advantage from the tax standpoint, as well as<br>an advantage to the Navy, in that it permits them better officer<br>planning.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurre. This is permissive, not; obligatory requirement ?</p>
<p>Mr. SuatinsHeK. Precisely. ;</p>
<p>572</p>
<p>Mr. Icuorp. What do you anticipate the Secretary will start of<br>rd vhat figure? re<br>al Duncan. He will start off with the $3,750, which is aske¢<br>or. ;<br>: The Cratrman.

Atel Pky at j<br>Secretary Hirrue. No, sir; that was not in priority. This 1s an 1tem<br>zation of the various factors that emerged through the interview<br>that indicated why these people were leaving the service, and su<br>itted their resignations. :<br>‘ Mr. PirniE. That is my understanding of your response to Mr. Pric<br>Secretary Hrrrix. In some cases with certain individuals, it mig<br>be any one of those four.

In a critical situation ? . we :<br>Secretary Hrrrie. Yes.

<p>oY 63)</p>
<p>I just got that from the atmosphere, as I walked out there a while<br>ago. [ Laughter. ]</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. The Fleet Reserve Association is one of the most<br>magnificent appendages you have to the U.S. N avy. In my 29 years<br>in Congress, I know of no organization that has done more for the<br>enlisted personnel and for the enlisted people in all ranks.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon, I want to welcome you aboard. This is fine company,<br>and they couldn’t have selected a more worthy and dedicated person<br>to receive this honor.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon. I should probably comment on this, but off the record.</p>
<p>The CrHarrman. I don’t want to hear any more from you, Mr.<br>Lennon.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you know what the bill contains—excuse me, Dr. Hall.</p>
<p>Mr. Haut. Mr. Chairman, inasmuch as the Secretary says that he<br>is speaking for the Secretary of Defense, with the Navy as the action<br>agency in this legislation, could I inquire as to whether or not, and<br>if so, how much this has been coordinated with Admiral Hubbell’s<br>so-called plan ?</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrix. I would prefer to have Admiral Duncan respond<br>to that, because he was in on the original formulation of this policy.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. This proposed legislation went the normal<br>procedural route and was approved by the Assistant Secretary of<br>Defense for Manpower, under whom Admiral Hubbell’s group worked.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatx. Do you still practice what I believe you refer to as the<br>blue and gold rotation scheme, or crew rotation?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. For the SSBN, or Polaris submarines.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatz. Asa personnel procedure, in the regular files of BUPERS,<br>Navy, or any personnel service of any of the three or four services,<br>resignation, after the payback period, is optional, including the now<br>popular 20-year resignations.</p>
<p>They may, at the option of Secretary of Defense, or indeed the<br>various Secretaries, be at any time after the payback period, well<br>understanding we don’t want a N avy with impressed service, or “press<br>gangs” I believe it is referred to in the statement, Why do we make<br>a policy of accepting resignations prior to completion of service?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. As you know, all regular officers serve at the<br>pleasure of the President, and we are at present retaining regular<br>officers 1 year beyond their normal obligated service. I think your<br>question was why.</p>
<p>The Cuairman. This is in their contract.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. I believe your question was addressed to why do<br>we accept resignations prior to the completion ?</p>
<p>Mr. Hatt. Putting it very succinctly, I hope, why isn’t it the pleasure<br>of the President, on recommendation of Chief of Naval Operations<br>or others, that we accept these resignations of these people who are,<br>after all of this training and experience, fleeing to civilian occupations,<br>even at higher rates of pay?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. Primarily, we want, of course, a voluntary Navy.</p>
<p>When we are in difficulty, as we have been for the past 2 years, in<br>line officers, and certain other communities, we do recommend to the<br>Secretary not accepting resignations, as we have currently, for 1 year,</p>
<p>after their obligated service, if I am addressing your question.</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>Mr. Wutre. Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>The Crarrman. Mr. Lennon.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>I would like to commend the general: for what I consider i<br>only an articulate but eloquent statement. There are not many pr<br>that can take a written statement and make an eloquent speech o:<br>subject, and also what I consider the clear, cogent, and convit<br>need.</p>
<p>Just for the record, sir, the obligation in any type of submarin<br>an officer or enlisted man is purely voluntary, isn’t it?</p>
<p>_ Secretary Hirrrrz. Yes. He voluntarily undertakes that duty.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon. That is right. But once an officer gets in, either i<br>nuclear or the conventionally powered, is he locked in? Can he<br>well get out of that duty and get back into the Navy and ho,<br>move up?</p>
<p>Secretary Hirriz. He can leave submarine service, but I would<br>the admiral to respond to that, because he handles this on a daily k</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. All submarine duty is voluntary on the pa:<br>the officer and enlisted man, and they can get out at any time.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon. What happens to the officer when he gets out of<br>marine duty ? What are the chances of going up ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. It would depend on the officer concerned<br>related to this legislation, naturally if he did not fulfill his cont<br>there would be a recoupment.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon. What has been the general experience in the }<br>when a man leaves the submarine service as an officer? What is<br>result ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. This is difficult to answer. They leave at var.<br>periods of life, after command, before command, sometimes at.<br>tenant. We have had them leave at all periods.</p>
<p>Admiral McCain, I believe, left after command, and he is<br>CINCPAC.</p>
<p>Mr. Lennon. I appreciate that. But I think it is the general<br>pression, once an officer is in submarine, particularly nuclear }<br>ered, and he comes out and goes back into some other aspect of<br>Navy work, his chances for advancement are generally not as g<br>Because his training has been exclusively in submarines. I’m gla<br>have that impression clarified if it is not correct,</p>
<p>I commend you gentlemen, because in the study in depth of<br>Subcommittee on Enlisted Promotion Policies that we made, we fo<br>clear evidence of the need in the field of submarine service as rel<br>to_your variable reenlistment. bonus and your proficiency pay.</p>
<p>I, for one, can vouch for the absolute necessity of this legisla<br>at this time.</p>
<p>The Crarrman. I would like to say this, too. Once a submari<br>always a submariner. They wear that thing, those dolphins, what<br>they are, on their chest. They are a pretty proud crowd.</p>
<p>The fine work you have done, Mr. Lennon, in the enlisted fiel<br>and Mr. Lennon forced the military to change a lot of archaic, 0<br>lete, and obsoleseent, practices they had, particularly one branch of<br>service, and he did a magnificent job in this field in his commit<br>and by way of the grapevine, I understand today, Mr. Lennon is g¢<br>to be made an honorary member of the Fleet Reserve Association</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>Mr. Haut. I know that, Admiral. I think you also know. that that</p>
<p>is almost the exception, and that indeed a mah must have a particular |</p>
<p>occupational specialty, or particular military training specialty before<br>that rule is applied.</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. No, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Haru. I am asking the general question, why do we allow 20-<br>year resignations, quote, “for the good of the service,” when a man is<br>perfectly qualified—indeed, we have a great investment—and he is<br>physically able to continue for his 30 years to age 62, or 30 years’<br>service, whichever comes first ?</p>
<p>Admiral Duncan. We hold officers of almost all communities, in-<br>cluding all line officers, this additional year at present.</p>
<p>I would like, if I may, to go back to the fact we would prefer not<br>to hold anyone. We would like to have a service where people want<br>to stay in, rather than any idea of holding him for some payback<br>which, frankly, cannot be related directly. We would like to have<br>a voluntary service where people want to be in it,</p>
<p>I realize this is not a direct answer to your question.</p>
<p>The Crarrman, Thank you, Doctor.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatt. So doI.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. Gentlemen</p>
<p>Mr. Price. I move the previous question.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. As many reporting out the bill favorably as<br>written.</p>
<p>(Unanimous Yes.)</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. A quorum is present.</p>
<p>I will handle the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>Mr. Buanprorp. Yes, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Cuamman. Thank you very much, gentlemen.</p>
<p>You are excused.</p>
<p>I thank every one of you.</p>
<p>Secretary Hrrrie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
