      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address, delivered on October 27, 1958, Rear Admiral H. G. Rickover pays tribute to Theodore Roosevelt on the occasion of his 100th birthday, emphasizing Roosevelt&#x27;s enduring relevance as a &quot;Modern American.&quot; Rickover highlights Roosevelt&#x27;s self-made character, forged through deliberate effort, his broad intellectual curiosity spanning sciences and humanities (as referenced in the *Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia*), and his balanced moral compass. The speech details Roosevelt&#x27;s foresight and leadership in national defense, including his pivotal role in modernizing the Navy (e.g., converting from coal to oil, improving gunnery through Lieutenant Sims) and his early recognition of aviation&#x27;s military potential in 1898, drawing parallels to modern advancements like the nuclear submarines *NAUTILUS*, *SKATE*, and *SEAWOLF*. Rickover also stresses Roosevelt&#x27;s pioneering advocacy for natural resource conservation and his concept of citizenship rooted in duties over rights, strongly condemning &quot;hyphenated Americans&quot; who prioritize group interests over national unity. The Admiral concludes by urging listeners to embody Roosevelt&#x27;s principles of courageous effort, national service, and a focus on essential values over material gain or self-absorption, echoing Elihu Root&#x27;s wish for Roosevelt&#x27;s presence in their own time.</p>

<p>KKLHKKKE</p>
<p>THEODORE ROOSEVELT - MODERN AMERICAN</p>
<p>Let me first express my deep-felt appreciation and gratitude<br>for the honor you have bestowed upon me by your award of the<br>Roosevelt Distinguished Service Medal. It is a great pleasure to<br>be with you tonight and join you in paying tribute to Theodore<br>Roosevelt - a great man and a greatly beloved American. This solemn<br>occasion gives us an opportunity to stop a moment in our daily rush<br>from one activity to another and to assess our personal and national<br>objectives, ideals, and actions in the light of the objectives,<br>ideals, and actions of this illustrious American. Homage by oratory<br>is an insubstantial thing unless, in the words of Roosevelt himself,<br>&quot;we sincerely endeavor to apply to the problems of the present<br>precisely the qualities which in other crises enabled the men of</p>
<p>that day to meet those crises.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I could add something new to our understanding of</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt. But, so much has already been said by people<br>who knew him personally or who have made a study of his life that<br>all I can do is to say what I admire most about him. Within the<br>limits of this occasion one cannot do Justice to a person of<br>Roosevelt&#x27;s versatility and accomplishment.</p>
<p>It is natural that because of my long-time interest in<br>education, I am particularly impressed with the manner in which<br>Roosevelt&#x27;s singularly attractive personality was shaped. He was<br>in harmony and balance within himself, for his heart, mind, and<br>body were all developed to their highest potential. In his day,<br>boys with similar background, here and abroad, received, as a<br>matter of course, a liberal education which trained their minds to<br>think clearly, logically and independently, and which taught them<br>what was needed to understand the world in which they lived. He |<br>received from his parents the right mixture of love and discipline<br>and, above all, constant encouragement and guidance. Home, school,<br>and church, in those days cooperated in educating the young. Schools<br>did not try to do the whole job, nor did parents try to shift<br>responsibility for raising their children onto the shoulders of<br>teachers. Learning was treated as a serious business; no one a<br>pretended it was fun and games. Children understood that they had</p>
<p>to work at becoming worthwhile adults. Roosevelt never ceased</p>
<p>preaching the necessity of effort for &quot;nothing worth gaining is<br>ever gained without it.&quot; To him &quot;the only life worth living is the i<br>life of effort...to attain what is worth striving for.&quot; |</p>
<p>2 |</p>
<p>Despite his excellent family background, Roosevelt was a self-<br>made man. He achieved greatness not because he was born a genius<br>or had other exceptional natural endowments but because he made<br>himself great. Time and again he stressed that pleasant as it is to<br>be born with superior attainments, only a few can ever be that<br>fortunate. He felt that through effort everyone could become<br>sufficiently competent to stand beside the exceptional man and do<br>his duty with equal efficiency. Of himself he said, with charming<br>modesty, &quot;I am just an ordinary man without any special ability in<br>any direction. In most things I am just above the average; in some<br>of them a little under, rather than over.&quot;</p>
<p>He was naturally proudest of his good health and his athletic<br>prowess because these he had created virtually himself, having been,<br>as he expressed it, a sickly and awkward boy who was nervous and<br>not overly confident. When he was twelve, his father pointed out<br>to the boy that he was a sorry physical specimen and had petter do<br>something about it. A gymnasium was installed in the house and<br>young Roosevelt set himself to developing his body. He worked at<br>this with iron determination and succeeded in transforming the sickly<br>boy into a man of exuberant health and vitality and above average<br>athletic competence.</p>
<p>From our own perspective the quality of his mind is his most<br>remarkable characteristic. He was at home in the sciences and the<br>humanities, in history and foreign languages, in all the liberal<br>‘arts. This broad knowledge enabled him to see national issues with</p>
<p>clarity and always to take the long view. He saw every problem</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>“rom 211 sides and against the totality of its background. We<br>misread him, in my opinion, if we overemphasize his passionate<br>mature which saw moral issues as black or white. Few persons would<br>teday question that he was right in his judgment of moral issues.<br>A thief to him was a criminal whatever his social position and<br>irrespective of whether he stole a loaf of pread, a thousand acres<br>of public land, the nation&#x27;s mineral wealth, or the wages he owed<br>to his employees in fair payment for their work. He had no false<br>sentimentality for a brutal murderer, and seldom gave a pardon for<br>he saw clearly that the right of law-abiding people to be protected’<br>from criminals outweighed the compassion he felt for kinsfolk who<br>pleaded for mercy. He would not compromise with the Ten Commandments.<br>Much as he hated evil, he was tolerant of evildoers when there<br>was extenuating circumstances, particularly when the evil he fought<br>was accepted in the milieu of the offender. He knew that most people<br>do not question the standards which prevail in their environment.<br>He hated machine bosses but he understood why people tolerated them.<br>He knew it was useless to fight them unless one also took steps to<br>ameliorate the conditions which had produced them. He hated patronage,<br>especially when it worked hardship on innocent public servants who<br>lost their jobs to protégés of influential politicians. He did his<br>best to abolish patronage by putting public service on a merit basis,<br>and he helped many a victim of patronage. But he understood that<br>the politician in the case was usually uninformed and thoughtless<br>rather than evil. Roosevelt was a moral man; also a kindly and</p>
<p>tolerant one.</p>
<p>In intellectual matters, he was cool and reasonable. If you</p>
<p>/ ree through the collection of his sayings in the Theodore Roosevelt</p>
<p>2H</p>
<p>Cyclopedia, you will find that he never pursues a principle to its</p>
<p>witimate end. At some point it collides with another principle,</p>
<p>or humanitarian considerations intrude. He always allows for these.<br>He was one of the strongest individualists, but he recognized the<br>necessity and propriety of collective action in particular cases.<br>He had no use for socialism but did not hesitate to work for ends.<br>which on occasion coincided with socialist objectives. He felt<br>every man owed it to his family to earn enough money for comfort<br>and for the needs of the spirit, but to go on amassing money beyond<br>this point he considered foolish and plameworthy. &quot;I am simply<br>unable to understand the value placed by so many people upon great<br>wealth,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Because of his well-trained mind and broad knowledge Roosevelt<br>often understood the specialist&#x27;s own problems better than did the<br>specialist himself, who is apt to be somewhat narrowly educated.<br>Although I am most familiar with the 4mportant steps Roosevelt took<br>to make the Navy more effective, I know that he took similar action<br>in many other fields. Take the matter of converting the Navy from<br>coal to oil. This had been debated for decades. The advantages of<br>oil were immediately evident to Roosevelt, the layman. He was not<br>hampered by fondness for the status quo. So he immediately ordered<br>conversion to begin. In the case of gunnery, it was again evident<br>to Roosevelt, the layman, that a navy is of little use if it cannot</p>
<p>hit the target. American gunnery was notoriously bad. “our Navy</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ime mm idea how low our standard of marksmanship was. We had not<br>meeliced that the modern battleship had become such a complicated<br>Sece of mechanism that the old methods of training in marksmanship<br>were as obsolete as the old muzzle-loading broadside guns themselves&quot;<br>writes Roosevelt in his autobiography. To him it was obvious that<br>&quot;the shots that hit are the shots that count.&quot; During the Spanish-<br>American War it looked as if our gunnery might be improved for it<br>was then feared that the French had trained the Spanish Navy. When<br>4t was discovered that Spanish ships aimed no more accurately than<br>American ships, the matter was dropped. But Roosevelt did not<br>forget. During his service as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he<br>had been impressed with a young lieutenant, Sims by name, who had<br>the audacity to criticize our gunnery and to propose improvements.<br>As soon as he was able to do so he put Sims in charge of organizing<br>a new system of naval gunnery and backed him to the fullest against<br>the enemies of progress. I like to think that the man who conceived<br>the novel idea of sending the entire battle fleet around the world<br>would have been pleased with the recent transpolar voyages of the<br>nuclear submarines NAUTILUS and SKATE, and with the SEAWOLF&#x27;s<br>submerged operations, completely independent of the earth&#x27;s<br>atmosphere for 60 days.</p>
<p>These things about Roosevelt are well known. Less known ishis instant<br>recognition of the military potentialities of the &quot;flying machine&quot;<br>he first saw in 1898. He recommended to the Secretary of the Navy<br>that a board of scientifically trained officers from the Army and</p>
<p>the Navy be formed to study this novel machine and report whether it</p>
<p>would be produced in large numbers. Roosevelt is the Navy&#x27;s own,</p>
<p>“wt the Air Force might well consider him their godfather!</p>
<p>His deep interest in puilding up our armed forces was an<br>outgrowth of his recognition, long before anyone else, that our<br>country stood at the crossroads. Up to then, we had gone about our<br>domestic affairs with little interest in the world outside, protected<br>as we were by friendly oceans which the British Navy kept free. He<br>realized the time had come to look to our own defenses. Similarly,<br>he understood that we had grown to industrial strength largely<br>through lavish and wasteful use of our great natural wealth. The<br>specialists in exploitation: the lumbermen, the mine owners, the<br>despoilers of our soil might scoff at conservationists and eall<br>them impractical dreamers. They were sure from their so-called<br>&quot;knowledge&quot; that our riches were inexhaustible; but not so Roosevelt,<br>the layman. He knew enough arithmetic to figure that if you keep<br>taking from a treasure house some day you will 4nevitably reach<br>bottom, no matter how large the original hoard. In his time this<br>simple truth was a novel idea. Even today it is not clear to many<br>people.</p>
<p>There had indeed been sporadic attempts as far back as the mic<br>nineteenth century to preserve something of our natural wealth from<br>grasping hands bent on profit at any cost. Not until Roosevelt<br>made the cause of conservation his own was anything achieved. He<br>kept warning that the time had come to conserve what was left of<br>our wealth and of the natural peauty of the American wilderness, &quot;So</p>
<p>that our children shall have a land that is more and not less fertile</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>“men thet our fathers dwelt in.&quot; This will never pe. Roosevelt</p>
<p>sinowed us the road; we took it hesitantly and went only a little<br>wey. Though we now accept the principle of conservation, each<br>American is today a great deal poorer in land and natural resources<br>han he was in Roosevelt&#x27;s day. We still use more lumber than we<br>grow; our good earth still washes in large volume downstream into<br>the oceans; we still waste irreplaceable minerals and fossil fuels<br>for manufacture of goods we do not really need. We forget that the<br>metals and fuels we expend for personal pleasure might some day be<br>needed to defend our national freedom against a country which keeps<br>its standard of material living down and thereby preserves its<br>natural resources.</p>
<p>This centennial celebration might well be made an occasion to<br>ponder Roosevelt&#x27;s warning that without conserving the resources<br>which are the material basis for our civilization, &quot;we cannot<br>maintain the institutions in which we take so great and so just a<br>pride; to waste and destroy our natural resources means to undermine |<br>this material basis.&quot; Waste, in my opinion, is a minor form of<br>treason; not deliberate of course, put rooted in heedless selfishness.<br>I believe Roosevelt would have so branded it were he alive in this<br>day of constant peril to the Republic. He was ever conscious of<br>the need to put the national good above private interest. He knew<br>that the fate of America rested upon the ability of each of us to<br>live our lives “in such a manner as to show that democracy can be<br>efficient in promoting the public welfare during periods of peace,</p>
<p>and in securing national freedom in time of war.&quot;</p>
<p>Citizenship in a democracy, he felt, was incompatible with</p>
<p>she banding together of men into groups based on national origin,<br>elass, wealth, or occupation, or for purposes of advancing the<br>group interest rather than the national interest. Such behavior<br>drew from him the strongest words of condemnation. He returns to<br>this subject time and again. Although many prominent Americans<br>were obsessed with fear of tyranny by the majority, Roosevelt<br>scoffed at this bugaboo. He pointed out that the real tyranny was<br>being exerted by organized minorities. Often the minority groups<br>fought against necessary action by the government which would have<br>benefited the nation though at the expense of certain group interests.<br>He realized that unless we accepted the ideal of national unity<br>wholeheartedly we could be torn apart by conflicting interests. In<br>his day the most vocal groups were those based on national origin.<br>Their attempts to dictate foreign policy were intolerable, and so<br>his strongest censure was directed at these men of divided national<br>loyalties. He scornfully called them &quot;hyphenated Americans&quot; and<br>warned that there was no place for them in this country.</p>
<p>Today there are few hyphenated Americans of that kind. But<br>we do have many organized groups who try to gain special advantage<br>through pressure tactics. Their tyranny, though more subtle, causes<br>greater damage to the nation. Often they force their own code of<br>behavior on an unwilling majority and they are eminently successful<br>in preventing criticism of group-approved actions. No one is more<br>severely condemned than the member of a pressure group who urges</p>
<p>reform, for he is considered a traitor. Likewise, the tendency of</p>
<p>these groups to tolerate neither abstention or defection of those<br>deemed eligible for membership is highly objectionable,<br>: There are many more such groups today than half a century ago,<br>and they are Powerful. Everyone is familiar with the influence<br>they exert on mass media to prevent expression of opinion, even<br>Statement of facts, which are against group policy or which are<br>considered offensive, The danger to the nation is that in time<br>such groups may prevent public debate of all vital national issues,<br>There are already some important matters which involve risk for the<br>courageous debater. We need men like Roosevelt to thunder against<br>the tyranny of these present-day hyphenated Americans. No one<br>believed more Strongly in free Speech than Roosevelt, He exempted<br>no one, not even himself, from publie criticism, for as he put it<br>80 clearly: &quot;Our loyalty is due entirely to the United States. It<br>is due to the President only and exactly to the degree in which he<br>efficiently serves the United States, It is our duty to support<br>him when he serves the United States well. It is our duty to oppose<br>him when he serves it badly.&quot; Is it not fantastic that we follow<br>this precept and we criticize our highest public officials without<br>fear, yet permit groups of these hyphenated Americans to frighten<br>us into silence?</p>
<p>Would that we could live up to the lofty concept of citizenship<br>in a democracy which Roosevelt urged upon us! He saw this concept<br>as one of duties rather than of rights, The subjects of tyrannical</p>
<p>sovernments can afford to be thinking of their rights, he said,</p>
<p>&quot;but the man who is really sovereign. . .must think of his duties first,&quot;</p>
<p>LO</p>
<p>No people will long remain free if they are too much absorbed in<br>personal concerns, too bent on material gain, too absorbed with<br>family life, &quot;Togetherness&quot; would not, I think, have appealed to<br>Roosevelt, devoted family man though he was. The quest for security<br>at all cost, the inward turning to shut out the problems of a<br>troubled world which is implicit in &quot;togetherness&quot; would have seemed<br>to him shirking a Sacred duty. He urged the average man to devote<br>much time and thought to the affairs of state and to do so not<br>Sporadically but continuously.</p>
<p>These ideas are as valid today as they were when he voiced them.<br>I fear that our dedication to having a good time would not please<br>him, were he alive today. &quot;If there ever was a pursuit which<br>Stultifies itself by its very conditions, it is the pursuit of<br>pleasure as the all-sufficient end of life,&quot; he warned. Optimistic<br>though he was by nature, he abhorred flabby optimism based on refusal<br>to face disagreeable facts. This, he said, lulled us into Supineness<br>which &quot;was the surest way to stop progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Though he was proud of the size and wealth of our country, he<br>emphasized that what counted most was not our exceeding good fortune,<br>but &quot;the way in which we use what we have.&quot; He considered it more<br>important that we be honest, brave, truthful and intelligent, &quot;than<br>that we should own all the railways and grain elevators in the world,<br>Material development means nothing to a nation as an end in itself&quot;,<br>unless &quot;within the soul there was the power of fealty toa lofty</p>
<p>ideal,&quot;</p>
<p>ll</p>
<p>He wanted us to face our destiny with high and resolute courage,</p>
<p>‘and above all to eschew the “fear of living.&quot; “we must either<br>succeed greatly or fail greatly,&quot; he said, and the decision rests<br>upon each and every one of us. ‘Many times he warns that life is<br>not easy, least of all for the man or the nation aspiring to greatness.<br>He prophetically foresaw that “the fate of the twentieth century a5<br>4% pears on the world will in no small degree depend upon the type<br>of citizenship on this continent.&quot;</p>
<p>: We owe 4t to his memory to prove equal to the challenge. And<br>many of us feel, as dia Elihu Root, “Oh, that we might have him with |</p>
<p>us now!&quot;</p>
