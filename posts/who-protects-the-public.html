      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s 1968 speech, &quot;Who Protects the Public?&quot;, delivered at the 50th Materials Engineering Congress, critically examines the inherent deficiencies of voluntary industry safety codes in safeguarding public health and well-being from technological hazards. Rickover argues that allowing manufacturers to set their own standards—as exemplified by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code—creates an unacceptable conflict of interest, leading to minimum requirements, insufficient independent inspection, and a false sense of security. He illustrates these failures with specific cases, including defective welds, a heat exchanger support failure costing over $500,000 in repairs, and cracked piping. Drawing parallels to the inadequacy of 1935 natural gas pipeline standards that necessitated government intervention (and citing the 1954 Atomic Energy Act as a better model), Rickover advocates for fundamental changes. His recommendations include mandatory independent design review and inspection, formal reporting and investigation of all failures, stringent qualification requirements for all personnel, and clear governmental oversight at all levels to establish and enforce robust safety codes, emphasizing that relying on self-policing by industry is &quot;naive.&quot;</p>

<p>at the</p>
<p>50th Materials Engineering Congress and Exposition</p>
<p>sponsored by</p>

<p>Detroit, Michigan</p>
<p>Monday, October 14, 1968</p>
<p>I welcome the opportunity of addressing this Materials Engineering Congress. You may remember that six years ago I spoke to you of "The Never-Ending Challenge." By that I meant the need for industry to keep on improving the quality of workmanship and the standards for inspection of its products in order to meet the continually rising requirements set by technology. We keep developing new technologies. Each new development calls for new levels of performance; there is no letup. Some progress has been made in the past six years but much more needs to be done.</p>
<p>Today I want to examine a related fundamental problem. It has to do with finding reliable means to prevent the private use of technology from doing injury to public health and well-being. I use this term in the broadest sense, including not only human life and health, but also natural resources, vital services, the whole of the environment enveloping man and society. Almost every new technology represents a potential hazard to these human values; the more advanced it is, the more various and deadly are its adverse effects likely to be unless there are adequate safeguards. These safeguards the public cannot itself provide; they must be the responsibility of those who control development and application of technology. Many believe that industry safety codes for equipment provide these safeguards. I submit that these codes, as currently developed and applied, do not fully meet this responsibility.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of any safety code depends largely on who sets it and who enforces it. As now constituted, industry codes have a built-in weakness, for they are prepared and controlled on a voluntary basis by the very people to whom they are to be applied; the analogy would be if the judge and the judged were the same. All of man's experience shows that self-policing does not give the public adequate protection. It does not even ensure safe use of ordinary consumer goods--foods, drugs, automobiles, etc. The purchaser has no practical way of judging them. The situation is not essentially different, though far more complicated in cases where the public buys a service, yet has no control over the equipment used to provide that service; where the individual is merely a passive recipient, as for example, in the transportation or utility industries. A complicating factor here is the widespread misconception of the roles and responsibilities of the parties who buy, make, inspect, and operate the equipment.</p>
<p>I am sure you are aware that the typical industry code is formulated by a committee elected or appointed by a technical society or similar group. Members are drawn primarily from the manufacturers to whom the code is to be applied. Near unanimous agreement in the committee must be obtained to set requirements or to change them. The code, which is then widely accepted and applied, represents a minimum level of requirements that is acceptable to the industry as a whole. What has happened--to put it bluntly--is that those directly involved in manufacturing a product are the very ones who set code requirements. The technical society and its code committees, at best, merely ensure that the requirements are uniform throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Let me now describe some of the deficiencies of industry safety codes and of the way in which they are used in the design, manufacture, inspection, and operation of equipment where safe and reliable operation is essential to public well-being. I will then submit recommendations for an alternative approach to setting and enforcing safety codes, one that seeks to take into account the proper role of each party involved.</p>
<p>Inadequacies of voluntary safety codes are not unique to any particular industry or type of product. To focus my discussion, I have selected a number of examples illustrating this problem in areas with which I am familiar. These examples range from problems associated with experimental facilities to those related to the construction of complex power plants.</p>
<p>Because of my background in nuclear power plants, I feel it necessary to make it plain that what I am talking about today is the manner in which industry safety codes are developed and applied. I do not wish my remarks to infer that nuclear power plants are unsafe. In applications of atomic power, the Government has provided a regulatory agency to protect the public interest. As a result of this supervision by the Government, the hazard to the public from these nuclear power plants has been minimized. One way this has been achieved is through the use of safeguards which do not merely depend on industry codes.</p>
<p>Before citing cases, I should make two more points that are important to a clear understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>Safety codes must not be confused with product standards, whose purpose is uniformity and interchangeability among similar products. To make this distinction clear, I will use the term "codes"--and not "standards"--when I refer to requirements for assuring safe design, manufacture, and operation of equipment. There are many aspects of design and manufacture which affect safety, including engineering and fabrication standards. Safety codes must cover all such requirements.</p>
<p>Minimizing cost should not be an overriding factor in setting safety codes. That industry must make a reasonable profit is a basic tenet of our free enterprise system. But public well-being requires that adequate safety codes be established. The contractual arrangements for specifying and making products which meet these requirements and for determining the legal responsibilities between the parties can then properly remain a matter between buyer and seller.</p>
<p>I will use a recent experience involving the American Society for Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code as an example to illustrate two serious problems in applying industry codes. The ASME Code is widely applied and is generally considered to be one of the better industry codes.</p>
<p>The problems are, first, that the Code does not require the manufacturer to deliver a product free of unacceptable defects; and, second, that the supposedly independent code inspector does not adequately represent the buyer's and the public's interests.</p>
<p>Recently, during fabrication of a pressure vessel in accordance with the ASME Code, the manufacturer radiographed one of the major structural welds and found several defects which required repair. In order to locate the defects accurately and thus facilitate repairs, the manufacturer, using ultrasonic techniques, made an additional examination of the weld. This examination, which is not required by the Code, revealed that numerous other defects might be present. The buyer, when notified by the manufacturer of these possible additional defects, considered them to be sufficiently significant in number and size to raise serious questions about the integrity of the weld. The manufacturer, however, took the position that the Code does not require repair of defects unless they are discovered by the specific inspection techniques laid down in the Code. The manufacturer, therefore, repaired only the defects revealed by the inspections specified by the Code. He then presented the weld to the ASME Code inspector, who accepted it. The Code inspection service in this case was provided by an insurance company hired by the manufacturer in accordance with practices outlined in the Code. These practices are accepted by most of our states, and have been incorporated into their laws.</p>
<p>The buyer repeatedly protested that the evidence produced by the manufacturer himself showed that the weld was suspect. These protests were met by the manufacturer and the insurance company with the assertion that the weld met all Code requirements. Thus the Code was in effect being used as an escape from the broad obligations that the product must have adequate structural integrity for its specified service conditions. In essence, what the manufacturer and the insurance company were saying was that it is proper to ignore pertinent and available information which casts doubt on the integrity of a product; and that despite this doubt the product may be certified as meeting Code requirements. The plain fact thus is that the Code requires only that a product meet the specified inspection requirements, not that it be free of unacceptable defects.</p>
<p>As for the insurance company, which is widely considered to be an independent code inspection agency, it acted in this case as though it were an agent of the manufacturer. To be specific, the insurance company would not take part in technical discussions of the pressure vessel's integrity with the buyer unless requested to do so by the manufacturer. The manufacturer refused to make such a request.</p>
<p>I should point out that this example of code application was not one involving only a single small manufacturer. The manufacturer in this case was wholly owned by an industry leader in the design and manufacture of equipment for power generating stations. During contract negotiations for the vessel in question, the parent company stated that it would use its technical and financial resources to assist the manufacturer to carry out properly his obligations under the contract. But, when this serious question of product integrity arose, the management of the parent company would provide no real assistance. They merely said they were prepared to assist their subsidiary and had assisted him on request. But they would take no position on the technical adequacy of the weld in question. In fact, they said they did not understand the buyer's insistence that they evaluate the suitability or acceptability of the weld. They also declared that they had not assumed any of their subsidiary's obligations. In conclusion, they said that their subsidiary "has advised us that the weld in question does meet the ASME Code."</p>
<p>In sum, the parent company also accepted no responsibility for the quality of the product beyond their narrow interpretation of Code requirements.</p>
<p>I have tried to understand why the parties concerned took this position. It seems clear to me that the Code as written was interpreted both by the manufacturer and by the insurance company to provide a well-defined limited liability for the manufacturer. As the case shows, this interpretation might have compromised safety had not a competent and alert buyer taken steps on his own and at his own expense to ensure the level of quality and integrity necessary to protect both his own and the public's interest.</p>
<p>To determine whether the position taken by the manufacturer and the insurance company had the endorsement of the ASME Committee which is responsible for developing and interpreting this Code, the buyer asked the Committee a simple question:</p>
<p>"If a component or part of a component (such as a weld) meets all of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code requirements, including those for inspection, but is known as a result of other supplemental inspection procedures to contain defects, must this additional information be evaluated in judging whether the component meets the Code?"</p>
<p>The reply of the ASME Committee was unfortunately couched in the diplomatic language typical of bureaucratic caution. It contained the following statements which contradict each other.</p>
<p>Here is the first: "If the inspector were aware of a harmful defect which was not disclosed by the Code examination but which did affect the safety of the vessel, he would have a moral responsibility to consider this information before certifying the vessel."</p>
<p>Here is the second: "Decisions based on such supplementary examinations are not Code matters and must be resolved by agreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser."</p>
<p>From this I conclude that morality requires that all available inspection results be considered, but the Code does not.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the refusal of the Code inspection agency to meet with the buyer unless so requested by the manufacturer, it was recommended that the ASME make it a Code requirement that inspection and certification be carried out by an organization independent of the manufacturer whose product is being inspected. The ASME Committee's answer was that in their view present practice already complies with this recommendation. They said that while the inspector's employer is paid by the manufacturer, this does not place either the inspector or his employer under the direction of the manufacturer, in the usual contractual sense. The ASME Committee did not, however, discuss or explain why the inspection agency, supposedly not under the direction of the manufacturer, would not meet with the buyer unless requested to do so by the manufacturer. I find myself completely at a loss how to reconcile their views with the facts.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to shed some light on this cloudy subject, I had inquiries made of insurance companies providing Code inspection services for vessels being manufactured to Code requirements. The inquiries sought to determine, first, whether the inspection agency actually serves the
