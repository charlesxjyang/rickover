      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1967 introduction speech for Senator John O. Pastore at the launching of the USS NARWHAL (SSN671), Admiral H.G. Rickover praises Pastore as &quot;one of the great men of the United States Senate&quot; and highlights his extensive career, including roles as Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and U.S. Senator for Rhode Island since 1935. Rickover particularly emphasizes Pastore&#x27;s significant tenure as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, noting his foresight, particularly in advocating for nuclear propulsion for naval surface vessels. The speech quotes a 1963 Joint Committee report, chaired by Pastore, which predicted nuclear propulsion&#x27;s advantages in combat effectiveness, global reach, and reduced logistic support, a prophecy Rickover asserts was proven by the success of the nuclear carrier USS ENTERPRISE off Vietnam. Rickover concludes by commending Pastore&#x27;s patriotism, intelligence, and hard work in supporting the naval nuclear program and the nation&#x27;s goals, linking his contributions to the tradition of foresight established by Senator Brien McMahon.</p>

<p>Introduction of senator John ©. Pastore, Rhode Island Chairman, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy</p>
<p>Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, USN at</p>
<p>Launching of USS NARWHAL (SSN671)</p>
<p>Groton, Connecticut Saturday, September 9, 1967</p>
<p>Distinguished guests. It is an honor and a privilege to introduce one of the great men of the United States Senate-- and I am sure that all of you remember his stirring keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 1964.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore has served the State of Rhode Island since 1935 in many capacities, including Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and since 1950 as United States Senator.</p>
<p>In the Senate he has risen steadily in seniority in the Appropriations and Commerce Committees and perhaps most Significantly has served as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in 1963 and 1964-~-and, of course, is its present Chairman.</p>
<p>Senator Fastore has a justly deserved reputation as an outstanding and eloquent speaker, but I believe he is less well known for his ability as a prophet. In 1963, under his Chairmanship the Joint Committee published a report on Nuclear Propulsion for Naval Surface Vessels. His report concluded, and I quote:</p>
<p>&quot;It is an indisputable demonstrated fact that nuclear propulsion increases the combat effectiveness of our surface warships. Nuclear propulsion has the fundamental advantage of permitting our warships to go anywhere in the world, to deliver their combat load and to return; all without logistic support....&quot;</p>
<p>We have only to note how successful the nuclear carrier ENTERPRISE has been off the coast of Vietnam in the past several months to see how prophetic his words were.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore, as Chairman of the Joint Committee, has admirably carried on the tradition of the Joint Committee which began with Connecticut's beloved Senator Brien McMahon. This tradition has been one of foresight, aggressive concern for the welfare of his fellow Americans, and the pursuit of excellence in the support of our national goals.</p>
<p>genator pastore is a man aedicated to peace put aware of tne awesome vesponsibilitics our Nation pears in efense of freedom throughout che world.</p>
<p>tT would like to end my introduction of senator pastore on a personal note- Tt nas been my privilege to know him for many</p>
<p>kindly aavice- rT am grateful that the U.S. senate contains ¢ man like genator pastore, who by nis patriotism, his intelligence: and nis hard work, has done $° much f0r che united states ana for</p>
<p>his own srate-</p>
