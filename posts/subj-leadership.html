      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a concise memo dated November 26, 1980, intended for publication in the Naval Institute Proceedings, the author delivers a sharp critique regarding the continuous stream of leadership articles, particularly those written by &quot;young inexperienced officers.&quot; The memo asserts that leadership is an &quot;esoteric concept&quot; whose principles are universal across military, business, and religious sectors, boiling down to fundamental actions: learning and working hard at one&#x27;s job, training personnel, and frequent inspection. Dismissing much of the current published material as &quot;sophomoric drivel,&quot; the author strongly recommends a decade-long &quot;hiatus on leadership articles&quot; in the Naval Institute Proceedings, arguing such a pause would benefit both the U.S. Navy and the nation by eliminating redundant and unhelpful content.</p>

<p>SUBJ: Leadership</p>
<p>1. The Naval Institute for many years has been publishing articles on leadership, many written by young inexperienced officers. The fact that the Institute has found it necessary to publish articles</p>
<p>dl Ae</p>
<p>fv Ride on this subject for so many years cause one to wonder what good these</p>
<p>articles do. 2. Leadership is an esoteric concept which cannot be defined--particu- larly by young and immature officers. 3. The principles of leadership are the same in the military service as they are in business, in the church, and elsewhere:</p>
<p>(a) Learn your job. This involves study and hard work.</p>
<p>(b) Work hard at your job.</p>
<p>(c)’ Train your people. :</p>
<p>(d) Inspect frequently to seg that the job is being done properly.</p>
<p>4. I recommend that the Naval, Institute call a hiatus on leadership</p>
<p>articles for a decade or so. will thereby be done to the</p>
<p>U. S. Navy or to the Unit 's. “In fact, some good may ensue. Readers of the Institute Proceedings will not be faced with more of</p>
<p>the same sophomoric drivel.</p>
