      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1960 &quot;Meet the Press&quot; interview, Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, widely recognized as the &quot;father of the atomic navy&quot; and a &quot;crusader for an educational system,&quot; passionately critiques the American educational landscape. Rickover asserts that the U.S. is falling behind nations like Russia, citing that few American high school graduates could pass examinations given to 17-year-olds in the Soviet Union, and comparing Sputnik&#x27;s impact on defense to what Pearl Harbor did for industry, suggesting education needs a similar jolt. He advocates for federal standards, better teachers, and a more rigorous academic focus, arguing that education is paramount for national survival and technological competitiveness. Rickover also criticizes the current system&#x27;s administrators (likening some to &quot;ex-athletic coaches&quot;), laments the lack of intellectual discussion in homes, and reveals he discussed these concerns with Nikita Khrushchev but not President Eisenhower or Secretary Arthur Flemming, highlighting his perceived lack of influence on U.S. policy despite his public agitation.</p>

<p>in just a moment , Admiral Rickover will MEET THE PRESS ,</p>
<p>(Announcenent)</p>
<p>THE ANNOUNCER: Now, MEET THE PRESS, Dreduced by Lawrence E. Spivak, bilo that the auestions asked by the members</p>
<p>ef the Panel do Rot necessarily Peflect their Point of view.</p>
<p>It is their way of getting the story for you.</p>
<p>Now here is the Moderator of MEET THE PRESS, Mr. Ned</p>
<p>Brooks. MR: BROOKS: Welcome once again to MEET THE PRESS. a</p>
<p>Our guest today is Vice Admiral Hyman Rickover, widely</p>
<p>recognized as the father of the atomic navy. ‘His achievement in applying atomic energy to submarine propulsion is ranked as one of the greatest scientific contr ibatbons of our time. In 1958 Congress voted him a special gold medal. Last year he was assigned by President Eisenhower to accompany Vice President Nixon on his visit to the Soviet Union. : Admiral Rickover has aroused nationwide interest in his erusade for fundamental changes in cur educational system. He</p>
<p>believes that education holds the key to our survival. He</p>
<p>has become one of the sharpest evitics of the school system at all levels. He has made a deep impression on the country by his brilliance and his refusal to be diverted when he considers the goal important.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover is making his first appearance today on a panel interview program.</p>
<p>And now seated around the press table ready to interview Admiral Rickover, are Ernest K. Lindley, of Newsweek Magazine, Chalmers Reberts of the Washington Post, James Reston of</p>
<p>the New York Times, and Lawrence E. Spivak, our regular</p>
<p>member of the MEET THE PRESS panel.</p>
<p>Now, Admiral Rickover, if you are ready, sir, we will start the questions with Mr. Spivak. MR, SPIVAK: Admiral, some of your critics are saying &quot;Admiral tAckover is a great engineer, Why doesn't he stick “to engineering and leave education to the educators?” Will you tell us why ue have taken’ #0 much of your valuable time to attack our educational system? | ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Mr. Spivak, do you remember what Clemenceau said about war: It was too important to leave to the military people. And education is too important +e leave to the educators. The gdlicatbes are public servants. As such they have every right to be criticized by any citizen in a democracy. When you can not criticize your public servants, then you have the Russian system. Therefore if we can not criticize, we do not have democratic education. MR. SPIVAK: Admiral, about two years ‘eo in an article ~ for This Week Magazine you wrote this, and I quote: &quot;As a people we have been caught napping, but the launching of Sputnik may well do for education what Pearl Harbor did</p>
<p>for industry and the military.&quot;</p>
<p>Would you say that the hope you expressed two years ago has been fulfilled?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: No, sir, it has not. There is some</p>
<p>little activity going on, there is some lip service being</p>
<p>given to better education, but it is by fits and starts.</p>
<p>Our people do not yet recognize how far we are falling behing. MR, SPIVAK: Adiniral, Arthur Flemming, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, who certainly is in a position to know or ought to be in a position to chee. says &quot;I do not</p>
<p>agree with those who say we are behind Europe and Russia in education. Taking the educational system as a whole, we have the best there is anywhere at the present time.&quot; Now upon what do you base your judgment? | |</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: If that is the case why is he asking» for more money for education if we already have the best educational system in the. world? |</p>
<p>I base my estimate on the fact that the United States Office of Education has published examinations which are asked of about 1.6 million Russians at the age of 17, in mathematics, in physics, in chemistry, in history, in foreign languages and so on. Very few of our high school graduates can pass that examination.</p>
<p>When our children can pass an examination as severe</p>
<p>as that, and that examination is not as severe as children</p>
<p>in Western Europe can pass, thea I will be satisfied with our school system.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Admiral Rickover, is our trouble thet we are lacking brains, or that we are not using the brains we.</p>
<p>have?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: We have plenty of brains in this country, Mr. Reston. We simply are not ning them,</p>
<p>The children in our schools are wasting their time on many subjects which have nothing to do with education what- soever. Of course this makes many jobs for guidance counsellors, athletic coaches, school administrators and so on, put it does not add to education. :</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: . Well, Admiral, it seems to me there is a paradox here. We may be behind’ in missiles, but in atomic submarines, for example, we apparently are leading the world.</p>
<p>Now you managed to recruit an extraordinary group of people and bring them in. Now why do we not do that in other forms, in other fields of endeavor in this country?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I can’t answer that, Mr. Reston.</p>
<p>I can only tell you this: I did not recruit extraordinary people, I recruited people who had extraordinary potential and then I trained them. There are no good people waiting to be hired. All the good people already have good jobs and the only way you can do it is to get promising people and devote most of your time and energy to training them. And I am sure if people who have charge of other projects will do that, they could have better luck too. MR. RESTON: What are you looking for, brains or character? ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I am looking mostly for brains at the</p>
<p>present time. You can't build submarines with character.</p>
<p>MR, RESTON; You mean you can take a heel and if he is smart you can whip him around and you will take your chances on that?</p>
<p>“ADMIRAL RICKOVER: if he does a good design job, Mr. Reston, I don't care what else he does in his spare time.</p>
<p>MR, ROBERTS: Admiral, starting with the fact that this country is in favor of general free public education for everybody, and recognizing the fact that we don't all have the same amount of brains ~~ you are the only one in the room who could do anything about this submarine, none of the rest of us could -- is your quarrel with the total nature of our system or only that it doesn't pull out of it the relatively small percentage of our people who can do these extraordinarily skillful jobs that seem to be needed to be done in this compe- tition with the Communists?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: My objection is to the cated system.</p>
<p>I believe that many, many more of our youngsters can be trained to be good scientists, good engineers, good adminis- trators, good musicians and good artists if we simply made</p>
<p>the try. The United States Office of Education claims officially</p>
<p>that 60 percent of our youngsters can not be trained in the way</p>
<p>I would wish. 1 think that many can. We simply are not trying</p>
<p>hard enough. We give up too soon. This is my basic</p>
<p>complaint against our education system.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS: Now if I understand from what you have been saying and writing, one of your proposals to solve this is to have a much more federal -=- much more federal control. You have said there are too many school boards, ausipeunie on local school boards are not equipped to run education. And yet isn't this the basic objection of most Americans, they don't want an Office of Education to run the local schools. Isn't this the problem that you are up against?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: We don't have to run our schools federally, but we can set up federal standards. Education has not been improved anywhere else in the world without first setting up standards. Now we have standards for railroad transportation, we have standards for airplane ‘travel, for lipstick colors, for the size of socks, but we have no standard for education. We have standards for what</p>
<p>goes into people's mouths, but we will not even permit</p>
<p>permissive standards for what goes into their heads.</p>
<p>I advocate that a federal permissive standard be set up for what. every boy or girl at age 18 should know. Then every parent can tell how well his children have done in school, how well the teachers are doing. Wherever this has been done, it has inevitably resulted in an upgrading of the school system.</p>
<p>MR, LINDLEY: Admiral, although your work requires a</p>
<p>high degree of specialization, you advocate a liberal education</p>
<p>as the foundation of education in this country, and as you indicated a moment ago you think with that type of education that many people who are not now considered goad students could be driven or encouraged to enlarge their minds.</p>
<p>How far would you carry that, how many years of general liberal education do you think every American should have?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I thoroughly agree that the basic education should be liberal. In Western Europe at the age of 17 or 18 the boys and girls who go to the academic high schools have acquired a liberal education which is about the equivalent of what we get after three to four years of college. And this I advocate for all of our children.</p>
<p>I would let them go just as far as they could. If, after a while they were not able to assimilate it, they would have to get off into technical training. But first of ail I would try as hard as I could to give every child in the United States a liberal education.</p>
<p>MR, LINDLEY: Through high school?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: At least through high school.</p>
<p>MR. LINDLEY: Well, now the Russian system recently was changed. At least a change was announced, I don't know whether it has peen carried through, to make it more difficult to get into the university and in effect to require two years of work, or two or three years of work in the factory or in.</p>
<p>the fields after high school, or the equivalent of high school.</p>
<p>Do you think that is 4 good thing?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: In Russia only about 30 percent of the high school graduates can go to college, 5° therefore they have far more people venting to go to college than they can accommodate so they can be choosy.</p>
<p>I talked with Mr. Khrushchev on this very point. He said there were too many people who were just going to school for the sake of going to school, but they have not carried that thought into effect fully. The smart youngsters getting out of high school go directly to college. The others go to work fr about two years and study at night time and then go on to college. |</p>
<p>MR, LINDLEY: Do you think that would be a good plan to adopt in this country?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I personally do not believe in working after high school and wiscwe college: I think that the children should go on immediately after high school because the mind</p>
<p>can grasp more, the younger the child is.</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: Admiral, I don't quite understand this.</p>
<p>Do you think too few people are going on to higher educa- tion, or too many, oF some of both?</p>
<p>‘ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I think too many are going on into higher education in the United States who are not prepared for it. 1 think we could probably stand having more going on to higher education than we do now, but that they should be better prepared than they are at the present time.</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: Well now Admiral, you yourself are the product of our american school system, You went to Annapolis, you went to the public schools, here. They tell me that you have done pretty well. Now what is wrong with a school system that can produce someone like you?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER Well , my education consists of the few technical things I learned at the Naval Academy plus about forty years of study and reading and thought in science and Literature and art and history and engineering.</p>
<p>Those forty years plus my public school education have made</p>
<p>me what I am today.</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: In short, you have found plenty of oppor~</p>
<p>sunity to educate yourself here 4f you have the desire to do so?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Of course. Anyone who has the de=- sire to educate himself can do So. But most people are lazy, their children see that they are lazy and the children</p>
<p>follow the habits of the parents.</p>
<p>Ll</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: Well, how are you going to instill this desire? You say our educational system can take care of the people who want an education, because it certainly took care of you, You had a chance to study and gain what you wanted.</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Not through our educational system.</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: You did it right here in this country though, didn't you? |</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Yes but mot in the educational system. T did it in spite of our educational system.</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: What major steps would you take. If you were_a dictator of education, today, if you could change the system, what would be your first step, what would you go about doing? | |</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Well the first thing I would do is set up a standard as I said before. You cannot get anywhere unless you have standards .</p>
<p>For example, when we went to nuclear power in the Navy</p>
<p>We had to set up new standards for the welding of stainless gteel and many other types of standards. We found unless we had those standards the shipyards and the factories | could not do a good job.</p>
<p>This is true everywhere in life, We first must nave a standard. Second, IT would get better teachers. Third, 1</p>
<p>would knock off some of the administrators who are really</p>
<p>running our schools. For example in one state, sixty per- cent of the public achool principals are ex-athletic coaches. People of that type should not be running our schools. In fact the voice of education is not the voice of the teachers, it is the voice of the administrators. The teachers never get to talk. I get many letters from teachers who tell me about conditions in the schools and they say &quot;Please don't use my name. I am afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>MR, SPIVAK: Well you talk about standards but we have standards, here.:.. I mean a boy has to get certain grades, he has to pass certain subjects in order to get through Harvard or Yale or any college, so that we do have standards. What do you mean by standards? You would set your own standards?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I am talking mostly about the grammar schools and the high schools. The high school diploma in this country has very little meaning because the require- ments are so different in various parts of the country.</p>
<p>It merely means in general that the child has sat in school for four years, It does not have anywhere near the same meaning that it has in Western Europe.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Admiral Rickover, you said you talked to Mr. Khrushchev about this. Have sau ever talked to the</p>
<p>President about it?</p>
<p>Admipfal rickover: no, sir.</p>
<p>MR. RHSTON: He has never asked you to come and talk to him about it?</p>
<p>Admiral rickover: no, sir.</p>
<p>wR. RESTON: What about Mr. Flemming?</p>
<p>Admiral rickover: no, sir.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Anybody in the government at all?</p>
<p>Admiral rickover : no, sir.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Mr. Brooks said you had made an enormous impression on this country with your agitation.</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Not on our government, though.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Now why is that?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: You will have to ask our governmental leaders about that.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Going back to what Mr. Spivak said earlier, you managed to do all right.</p>
<p>Now what about the responsibility of the home in all this?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I believe that if the parents did their job, we could have much better educated children, It has been found out after considerable research that how children do in school, not only here but even in Russia, is based on the influence of the home. If the home is a place where there are simply good surroundings, where the children simply get good clothes and lots of entertainment and theve ‘4s no intellectual discussion in the home, that has quite an</p>
<p>effect on the children. You will find many studies show that</p>
<p>the parents are the greatest influence in how well their children do. And until ard unless the parents recognize</p>
<p>that if they decide to bring children forth into this © world, that they have a deep responsibility to look out for their posterity, Until they Gecide that, until — under= stand that that is their most important function in life, we will not have better schools. Today the parents are mostly satisfied with having a good time, and we are Looking out</p>
<p>for things that are not concerned with the intellect of their</p>
<p>children,</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: What do you do about the kids that come out</p>
<p>of good hones and go to good universities and where there</p>
<p>is agitation for standards of excellence in the family, intellectually, and then they use this excellence in very secondary, endeavors. Whereas in Russia which you are always quoting, they direct their brains to the place where the state needs those brains the most. What do you do about this problem?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: We could do the same thing here without state compulsion, if our values were not such that we gave material possession euch a high place in our scheme of things. If we were taught now that this is really an affluent society where everybody really has enough to get abeng on, that there are many other things in life besides posses— sions, filling our homes with new things.» Every day the nursery rhymes on TV and rads urge us to buy new things.</p>
<p>If we have learned that these things are thrown in the ashcan in a couple of years, put what you put in a child's</p>
<p>mind stays there forever, if we realize that, that the intellectual life, the life of the mind is just as important</p>
<p>. as getting money and material things, I believe many of whose youngsters would go on to do intellectual endeavors.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: What you are talking about now is the whole philosophy of the country?</p>
<p>Admiral rickcver: yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: The sense of values of the country?</p>
<p>Admiral rickover: yes, sir.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: Not the educational system. Is this the heart of the problem? :</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Well, the education of our country is | a part of the sum total. You can’t divorce the educational system from the country, nor can you divorce the penpona ibility of all the people from our educational troubles. You can’t blame one group of society, It is our collective fault.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS: I'd like to ask you about one proposal you have made specifically, if I understand it correctly, and that is the idea of doing something more for the so-called bright kids in our schools who, if I understand your criticism and that of others, have been often lost by making schools the lowest common denominator. The bright kid is lost in the mass. Am I right that you want to have a separate school system for the brighter kids, or how would you pull that boy up or that girl up above the level of the mass of the kids?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Mr. Roberts, I believe that every child in this country no matter where he comes from, what the financial status of his parents is, what his social status is, should have an equal opportunity to develop himself to the maximum. I would give federal aid to education as is |</p>
<p>necessary to accomplish this. iI would net stop any youngster</p>
<p>who is brilliant, fees not have him held back by anyone dae. I would let each child proceed at his maximum. I would not have separate schools, necessarily. You could have</p>
<p>it in separate parts of the same school. But I would group children, after about 10 or 11 years of age, in accordance wth their abilities. So that every child in every school is working as hard as he can. |</p>
<p>If you put the bright youngster in with the dullard,</p>
<p>the bright one becomes lazy and becomes troublesome, if the</p>
<p>dullard becomes dissatisfied because he reaches an</p>
<p>inferiority complex, so I would separate them 50 each one is</p>
<p>doing the best he can.</p>
<p>» MR. ROBERTS: Are you in favor of a strictly limited kind of education? You have criticized so-called frills or trivia in education. Do you think we ought to get rid of all sports that we have in our school system, high school football and that sort of thing, and stick to the classroom, is that what you are talking about?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I would stick to the classroom with the exception of physical education. Physical education is essential, but many of the organized sports are done more for</p>
<p>2) the entertainment of the parents than it is for the children themselves. It also is done to a great extent to make jobs for various people. : :</p>
<p>The school is not the place for this. The school is</p>
<p>tax supported. There is a distinction between training and education, Education can be done best in the school, Training should be done by the home, by the church and by the community. And when we try in a 180 day school year, five hours a day, to do everything in a school, we accomplish nothing well. : I would use the school to train the intellect.</p>
<p>MR. LINDLEY: Admiral, I wonder if we might turn to atomic development for a moment. You have seen it first hand -= at least parts of the Russian étonic program, and you iniby what we are doing. Are they ahead of us in any significant phase</p>
<p>of atomic development, either peaceful or for military</p>
<p>purposes?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Mr. Lindley, I can only talk about the subject with which I am familiar. That is atomic submarines, and the peaceful applications of atomic! power. I do not believe they are ahead of us in atomic submarines, I do not know of any atomic submarine they have. I am sure with the Russian tendency to boast about what they have done, if they did have an atomic submarine at the present time we would know about it.</p>
<p>As far as the peaceful uses of atomic energy is — concerned, I do not think they are in advance of us. We haven't gotten very far either, but I don't think they have gotten as far as we have.</p>
<p>MR.. LINDLEY: Could you make an estimate today as to when</p>
<p>atomic power will become competitive economically with other sources of power?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: It is foolhardy to say what will happen in the next year or so but I confidently predict that it will not be economically competitive for at least ten years, perhaps 20.</p>
<p>MR. LINDLEY: You would agree, I suppose, that the</p>
<p>Russians are ahead of us in space -~ at least they have been able to put larger objects into space. i Have you any recommendation as to what we might: do with</p>
<p>our space program in order to overcome that handicap?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: I can only talk in generalities. I</p>
<p>think our governmental operations could be very much stream-</p>
<p>lined so that the people who are trying to do a job are not</p>
<p>interfered with as much as they are, with the reports, committees, memoranda and so on.</p>
<p>For example, my own time is taken up about 75 percent</p>
<p>with writing reports. The other day I told one man who asked me to write a report I could either give him this report or build a submarine, which did he choose? I believe I will</p>
<p>probably have to write the report.</p>
<p>a | MR, LINDLEY: Was he in the Executive Branch or the Congress? | ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Executive Branch, not Congress.</p>
<p>MR. SPIVAK: Admiral, do you think we are in a life and</p>
<p>eee HEA</p>
<p>death struggle with the Soviet Union? ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Why of course we are, Mr. Spivak. MR. SPIVAK: And what do you think, do you think education or military defense is more important in that life and death</p>
<p>struggle at the present time?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Education is more important because military developments are transitory. They change every year or so, But education is permanent and unless we have a thoroughly educated citizeary we will not be able to solve either our military problems or the many other problems that are facing this country.</p>
<p>This is why I consider education of far greater importance than anything there is in this country, any problem we have.</p>
<p>MR, SPIVAK: Admiral, if we did everything you wanted us to do it would take years before we began getting results of your plans for education, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Well, but the sooner we start, the quicker we will catch up.</p>
<p>MR, RESTON: You are not suggesting, Admiral, are you, that there might be some waste in the Pentagon that might be applied to education, are you?</p>
<p>? | ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Well, I know that if we cut the people in the Pentagon by about twenty to thirty percent, a lot of the</p>
<p>work would go on nuch quicker than it does now.</p>
<p>MR. RESTON: You mean if we cut them we could both improve</p>
