      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This memorandum details a wide-ranging, three-hour dinner conversation on May 31, 1979, between Admiral Hyman Rickover, President Jimmy Carter, Rosalynn Carter, and Amy Carter—an event Rickover&#x27;s wife arranged without his prior knowledge. Key themes included Rickover&#x27;s candid criticisms of black leadership, citing interactions with Benjamin Hooks, Vernon Jordan, and Coretta King, and a discussion about Jesse Jackson. He also expressed concern over the &quot;vast power&quot; of Political Action Committees and lobbying&#x27;s influence on Congress, the fragmentation of the party system, and inefficiencies in government, advocating for radical elimination of &quot;useless jobs.&quot; On national security, Rickover pushed for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and discussed the Russian 40-knot submarine and issues like shipbuilding fraud. A notable section recounts Rickover&#x27;s unique interview process for the Navy&#x27;s nuclear program, including his decision to accept a black student with an unusually low SAT score (800) due to his work ethic, and his general views on media inaccuracies, Defense Department reorganization, and even historical figures like General Robert E. Lee and Mussolini. The memo concludes with lighthearted notes about Mrs. Carter&#x27;s visit with Pope John Paul II and Rickover&#x27;s own Vatican experiences.</p>

<p>Rickover's Dinner with President Jimmy Carter</p>

<p>included Ollie North and Admiral Rickover’s second wife, Eleonore. We met agai: her condo in the course of my previous job. She bequeathed all of his personal papers (which amounted to about 250 archival boxes) to my office and, ina memorandum of agreement with the Director of the Nimitz Library, we agreed th should be in Special Collections &amp; Archives so that they could be catalogued, properly preserved, and made immediately available to any and all researchers. A! the archivist went through the collection to catalog it, I went through every page probably tens of thousands of pages including correspondence, transcripts of telephone conversations and interviews, and memoranda for the record. This collection led to my co-edited volume, “Rickover Uncensored;” the corrected 2™4</p>
<p>edition of will be out in the next month or so.</p>
<p>So many documents stand out from 1929 to 1986, but many deal with President Carter who had interviewed with Admiral Rickover for the Navy’s nuclear power program. When Rickover asked him if he had done his best at the Academy, Carte responded that he hadn't. Then Rickover asked, “why not the best?” That phrase eventually became the theme for Carter’s 1976 presidential campaign. There was</p>
<p>even a campaign song by folk singer/songwriter Oscar Brand with that title.</p>
<p>Carter sought out Rickover’s support early in the campaign. They remained in contact and then communicated regularly when Carter became president. Several</p>
<p>Rickover’s memos went directly to Carter, skirting his chain of command.</p>
<p>During one visit to the condo apartment she and the Admiral lived in, Eleonore t me about how she had invited Rosalynn and her family to dinner, without telling Rickover. If you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall to listen to a conversation, this it. Rickover nearly always wrote a memorandum about his meetings with policymakers. His dinner with Carter was no different. Eleonore probably wanted the Carters to have a relaxing evening. Instead, it was full of policy, both national</p>
<p>security and domestic issues.</p>

<p>(diary image from The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum) 1 June 1979 Memorandum of Conversation with President Carter at my Apartment on 31 May 1979</p>
<p>1. Unbeknownst to me, my wife had invited the President, Mrs. Carter, and Amy to have dinner with us on 31 May. She had told me the dinner was for a friend who belonged to a religious group and would be coming over with her husband, a</p>
<p>lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, and their young 10-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>3. I later learned that the genesis for this visit was the airplane trip to Groton for th keel-laying ceremony of the GEORGIA by Mrs. Carter. My wife and I had been ont same plane with Mrs. Carter and, on the return trip to Washington, my wife had</p>
<p>discussed (without my knowledge) the possibility of having them to dinner. It seem: that for the past week many arrangements had been made - telephone calls, securit</p>
<p>checks by Secret Service personnel, etc., of which I had not been aware.</p>
<p>4. The President and his family were with us for about three hours. This gave me ar opportunity to have lengthy discussions on a number of subjects. I will mention the</p>
<p>as I remember them, though not necessarily in the order of their occurrence.</p>
<p>¢ Black Leadership. I said I was distressed with the attitude of the black leadership the United States. It appeared to me they were more interested in their own self- advancement than in the advancement of the black people. I said I would appreciat his not making any comments on what I was saying in this matter, so that it could never be construed he agreed or disagreed with me. The President said he would m</p>
<p>no comments.</p>
<p>I said I had dealt with Benjamin Hooks and Vernon Jordan. I had also met Coretta King ona plane trip two years ago from Washington to Atlanta. I sat next to her an: had heard her talking to a companion. When I asked her if she was the wife of Mart Luther King, she said she was. Thereupon I said, “You don’t look as good as your pictures.” For some reason she seemed surprised and distressed at this comment. T was the only opportunity I had to speak with her. She turned away and thereafter</p>
<p>talked only with her companion.</p>
<p>I told the President that my impression on all the occasions I have spoken with blac</p>
<p>leaders was that they were more interested in advancing their own personal interes</p>
<p>September 1977, in improving the education of black youth. (Enclosure 1)</p>
<p>As far as the government’s attitude and actions relating to minorities was concerned, I told him there had been a letter recently from a black leader to the Ne York Times stating that the time had come for blacks not to ask for special treatme</p>
<p>I said I would send him a copy of the letter and replies to it. (Enclosure 2)</p>
<p>The President said that Reverend Jesse Jackson was trying to help black yout agreed and said I had once talked to him on the telephone and asked that he arrang for us to meet in order to discuss the matter. I had never heard from him. The President replied that he would telephone Jesse Jackson and discuss with him a</p>
<p>meeting with me.</p>
<p>Political Action Committees. Next, I discussed the vast power being acquired the United States by large conglomerates through their lobbyists in Congress. It appeared to me that they were, in essence, running the United States. As a student | history, I knew of no period in the history of the United States, including the 1880’s after the Civil War, when lobbying was so prevalent. In those times it was for land, railroads, and mining rights. But today this has extended into all aspects of politics.</p>
<p>business, and industry. The President agreed.</p>
<p>o I told the President that, as far as I could determine, there was considerable suborning of Congress by large campaign contributions from industry to Memb«s of Congress and to State officials from funds that the law permits them to obtair from their officials. I had personally witnessed this in connection with the</p>
<p>Renegotiation Board.</p>
<p>o The President said he fully supported the Renegotiation Act but was not able</p>
<p>they were signing.</p>
<p>o I said it would be a fine thing for the United States if Congress enacted the bi which would give $75,000 to each Member of Congress toward financing his campaign. The President said he did not think the bill would get through Congr:</p>
<p>this session.</p>
<p>The Party System. We then had a lengthy discussion on Congress. I said that party system had gone by the board. The President was once the leader of his Party. but today Congress was largely fragmented with committees, subcommittees, and their large staffs. These bloated staffs were, for example, keeping Energy Departme officials busy testifying and answering questions, so that it was almost impossible t</p>
<p>get any work done.</p>
<p>o I recalled Clarence Cannon’s attitude on staffs. I said I had been very close to him when he was Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. In fact, he had invited me to his home where he played the piano for me. Time and again th members of his committee had urged him to increase the staff. He had invariably refused to do so. I said I considered this was an excellent example to follow in vii of the great proliferation of congressional staffs in recent years. For example, the Energy Department must now deal with about 38 committees and subcommittee This means that all Energy Department officials have most of their time taken u)</p>
<p>testifying. The President agreed.</p>
<p>o The President mentioned that he received considerable help from Senator By the Majority Leader of the Senate, but he did not get as much help from Congressman O’Neil, the Speaker of the House.</p>
<p>o I mentioned that Mussolini had set up a corporate state in Italy in 1921. He h:</p>
<p>industry actually controlled the government; the representatives of the people he</p>
<p>little power.</p>
<p>SALT Talks. I told the President I thought it would be a good idea to consummate the SALT talks quickly in order to reduce tension between the United States and Russia. I once more recommended that upon consummation of the SAL] Treaty, he should initiate naval disarmament talks to reduce the cost of military for</p>
<p>throughout the world. He made no comment.</p>
<p>Fast Russian Submarine. The President asked about the Russian 40-knot submarine. I said that our 688-Class, by taking certain measures could probably ma about four knots more than its present speed and we would therefore be close to th Russian’s speed. I said the Russian submarine was a test vehicle and not a complete</p>
<p>combat submarine as was the 688.</p>
<p>o I said that while issues were being made that we were behind the Russians in speed and numbers of ships, the Navy civilian sector was recommending at the v</p>
<p>same time that we reduce the speed of our submarines. I said the 688-Class was :</p>
<p>fine submarine and should be continued.</p>
<p>The Naval Nuclear Program. I told the President that I had never spoken out against any administration stand on the Navy or any other matter. He agreed with t However, in connection with the aircraft carrier, I said I considered him to be in er) in advocated a 53,000 ton carrier which could only carry a small number of planes. I said if there was to be an additional carrier, it should be nuclear powered for reasor he well knew - particularly with the oil crisis becoming more severe. I could see no purpose in spending money to build a 53,000-ton carrier or even a Kennedy Class carrier if his objective was to save money. I recommended that he cancel his reque:</p>
<p>for any carrier other than a nuclear one. I said I knew it was not my decision to mak</p>
<p>operation — but if there were to be another carrier, it should be nuclear powered.</p>
<p>o I mentioned there were now 12 carriers in operation. How that number had b decided I did not know, and suggested this should be looked into. I said that possibly the National Security Council had decided the number.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding Claims. I told the President that at the present time two grand juries were investigating the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company :</p>
<p>the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics on potential fraud.</p>
<p>DC 10. I said that it may be worthwhile having the FAA investigate whether there were requirements for routine inspections of this aircraft. Also whether recor were kept, and whether these were listed in detail and whether those persons conducting the inspections signed for each item inspected. Also, whether the basic design of the plane had even been checked by an agency other than the company th</p>
<p>designed and manufactured it.</p>
<p>o I said that in the Navy’s nuclear program we had kept records from the</p>
<p>beginning of each item to see that it had met all inspections. In fact, we had recc of each weld in the ship, as well as for the equipment installed going back to wh« it was being manufactured. We could go back years later and consult the record ' the welding rod used, who made the weld, who inspected it, and the signatures o</p>
<p>those who certified the work.</p>
<p>o I suggested it might be worthwhile to see what similar standards were used ir</p>
<p>the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Interviews for Entry into the Navy’s Nuclear Program. I mentioned earlier the day I had interviewed 25 candidates for entry into the nuclear propulsion program. of course, knew that I had three or more people interview each candidate before I</p>
<p>conducted the final interview. I recalled two interviews that were particularly</p>
<p>o The first was with a student who did well in his class but had studied little. During my questioning, it developed that his father was paying the student’s expenses through college. I asked the student whether he was playing fair with h father by using the latter’s money and not studying. The student finally agreed tk he was not fair. Thereupon I asked him to write to his father and tell him what I said about his conduct in this matter, and to send me a copy of his father’s reply. happened to have this letter (Enclosure 3) close at hand and I let the President re it.</p>
<p>o The other candidate was a Dartmouth student who had be interviewed by five leading people at Naval Reactors, all of whom had recommended that he not be selected. After two discussions, I decided that he was intelligent, worked hard, a probably would get through our school. I had therefore accepted him contrary tc the advice of my people.</p>
<p>o I told the President of a recent case where I had interviewed a black student</p>
<p>from a small Southern black college. I believed he was familiar with the caliber c these colleges. This student had a SAT score of 800, the lowest I had ever seen fo an applicant for the nuclear program. To put this in perspective, the minimum S score required by the Naval Academy was 1200. I had decided to accept this man over the advice of the interviewers. In my discussions with this black applicant, : developed that he came from a very poor farming family and had little chance fo: education. I considered that with his apparent intelligence, and the fact he had</p>
<p>worked hard in school to overcome his educational shortcomings, I was willing t</p>
<p>take a chance on him and so I accepted him for our school. This was the first tirr</p>
<p>had ever accepted anyone with a SAT score lower than 1050.</p>
<p>The Media. The President talked about the many inaccuracies attributed to hi by the press, and gave a number of examples by newspaper reporters. Even after he</p>
<p>had advised them of the errors, they still did not print proper retractions. He said tl</p>
<p>o lasked the President whether he liked his job. He said he was quite comforta with it and did not mind the criticism too much. He would keep on doing what |</p>
<p>thought was best regardless of what the press and others said about him.</p>
<p>o I brought up the subject of the articles in the Atlantic Monthly by Jim Fallow: who had been on the White House staff; these articles had been critical of the President’s conduct in office. He said that Fallows had been a relatively minor</p>
<p>member of the staff and had no direct dealings with him.</p>
<p>o I then said there had been considerable criticism in the press concerning the members of this staff from Georgia. He replied that these were good men; in fact nearly all members of his staff from Georgia had been with him for over eight ye and that he had personally chosen them. I said I had observed that his staff members were no longer avid for publicity as had been the case at the beginning his term when their private affairs and other personal matters had been openly discussed in the press. I said I believed it was an excellent move that now kept hi</p>
<p>staff as anonymous as possible.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Defense Department. I told the President about the rec discussion I had with Peter Szanton of the Office of Management and Budget concerning the reorganization of the Defense Department; a study initiated by the President himself. He replied he knew nothing of this, and would look into the mat Mr. Szanton had visited me to get my views about the Defense Department. In a conversation several days later, he said he had taken the matter up with the Head ot the Office of Management and Budget and was told that nothing could be done because the time was now too close to the national election. The President said this was not true. I also said I had telephoned Mr. Eizenstat twice to tell him this, but hi</p>
<p>never received a reply.</p>
<p>Organizations. In connection with eliminating useless jobs in the Federal</p>
<p>In other words, the only permanent way is to extirpate it entirely.</p>
<p>General Robert E. Lee. I expressed my opinion that General Lee, in view of hi position in the Confederacy, should have told the Southern leaders after Gettysburg and Vicksburg that he could no longer hope to win the war. Thus the ultimate loss « life and wealth to the Confederacy would have been lessened. In view of his positio: the Confederacy, his advice would probably have been heeded. The President was n</p>
<p>certain he could agree.</p>
<p>Visit with the Pope. Mrs. Carter mentioned her recent visit with Pope John P: II at which Amy was also present. Amy had a number of items she wished the Pope bless. Every time she placed the items in front of him, he had other thoughts and would change the subject. This happened several times. I never did find out whethe</p>
<p>the Pope blessed the items.</p>
<p>o I told the President and Mrs. Carter about the time in 1957 when I had visited the Vatican. I had been taken by the curator through a long corridor containing many ancient works of art. I asked Mrs. Carter if she had seen these. She said shi</p>
<p>had and was quite impressed.</p>
<p>o lIasked if she had also visited the room in the Vatican which contained the fo frescoes painted by Raphael. She did not remember it at first but, as I recounted details, she said she did see it. | mentioned my visit to the Vatican when the</p>
<p>frescoes were being renovated. Mrs. Carter was quite interested in this story.</p>

<p>Neat history!! My dad, a WWII vet and submariner, was rejected by the Admiral in his brief, minu long interveiw. It basically amounted to the Admiral saying, &quot;you can't teach an old dog new tricl Dismissed.&quot;</p>
