      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a speech delivered upon receiving the Michael Pupin Medal at Columbia University in October 1958, Admiral H.G. Rickover passionately champions Western education as the singular force behind human progress and the dynamism of Western civilization. He presents Michael Pupin&#x27;s life as an exemplary immigrant success story, nurtured by a liberal education spanning the US, Cambridge, and Berlin, to underscore the &quot;common heritage&quot; shared between America and Europe. Rickover asserts that the West&#x27;s higher living standards and scientific miracles, such as penicillin, stem from European inventions like formal education, public libraries, universities, and academic freedom. He sharply contrasts this with pre-revolutionary China&#x27;s examination system, arguing it fostered &quot;mental ossification&quot; and stagnation, leading to a society incapable of adapting to population growth and ultimately resulting in the brutal pragmatism exemplified by Mao Zedong. Rickover refutes the idea that Western civilization is merely materialistic, highlighting its contributions to human well-being. He concludes by criticizing contemporary American educational trends, which he labels &quot;life-adjustment, behavioral conditioning, and a leveling downwards,&quot; urging a return to a robust liberal arts curriculum (echoing &quot;Delenda est life-adjustment conditioning&quot; from Cato the Elder) that fosters independent thought and is aligned with the comprehensive educational ideals articulated by Theodore Roosevelt.</p>

<p>CFFICE CF SECURITY REVICW (QASD L&amp;PA)<br>A COMMON HERITAGE DEPADTHEMT NE PrErNeT</p>
<p>I should like to express my deep appreciation to Columbia<br>University for having bestowed upon me the honor of being the first</p>
<p>A hundred years ago this, month, Francis Joseph, Emperor of<br>Austria and Hungary, acquired still another rebellious Serbian sub-<br>ject. Fifteen years later, this subject had enough of the stifling<br>air of stagnation which pervades dying societies. A chance acquaint-<br>ance with two traveling Americans had convinced the young man that in<br>the New World he would find an invigorating atmosphere of freedom.</p>
<p>So he sold his school books, his sheepskin coat and cap, and sailed<br>across the seas. Up to a point, Pupin&#x27;s was the typical &quot;poor |<br>immigrant makes good in America&quot; success story. He arrived here, a</p>
<p>red fez on his head, with five cents in his pocket, and immediately</p>
<p>went to work at whatever job he could find. Millions of others began</p>
<p>life in America in the same way.</p>
<p>But Pupin was a little unusual in that he had come here to<br>continue his education. From the first day he set himself to master<br>English and prepare for college. Atter, five years of hard physical<br>work and night-time study, he passed the entrance examinations with<br>honors and received a scholarship to Columbia College. At twenty-<br>five years of age, only three years older than the average American<br>student, he received his pachelor&#x27;s degree from this institution.</p>
<p>No mean achievement this, when you consider the difficulties he had<br>to overcome: Lack of funds, the need to master a new language,<br>adjustment to mores as different from those of rural Banat on the<br>Austrian frontier as one could imagine!</p>
<p>By tutoring other students and with the help of scholarships,<br>Pupin was able to continue graduate study in mathematics and physics.<br>He was advised that the best place for such study were the famous<br>universities of Europe. He therefore returned to Europe and studied<br>first at Cambridge, then at Berlin where he received his doctoral<br>degree. Upon his return to America, he joined the faculty of<br>Columbia University where he remained for the rest of his active<br>academic life. He beseme one of America&#x27;s great physicists and in-<br>ventors. His primary field of interest was electrical communications.<br>One of his great inventions brought about a reduction of attenuation<br>and distortion in long-distance telephone communications and commem-<br>orizes his name. In Europe, telepone lines using his invention are</p>
<p>called &quot;pupinized&quot; lines.</p>
<p>In the making of this great inventor we can observe a happy</p>
<p>synthesis of the most diverse educational influences. Begun in a<br>Serbian village school, continued in secondary schools in the Voyvodins<br>and in Bohemian Prague, and thereafter in an American college, com-<br>pleted at the universities of Cambridge in England and Berlin in<br>Germany - Pupin&#x27;s education symbolizes the basic unity of academic<br>life in all countries of Western civilization. This unity is a precious<br>thing which cannot, to my mind, be overemphasized. The centennial of<br>his birth offers an opportunity to reaffirm: the common heritage we<br>share with Europe, whence have come the ancestors of nearly all living<br>Americans, The spiritual and intellectual ties which bind the New<br>World to the Old have been woven by millions of immigrants - not many<br>of them Pupins, it is true, but all carrying with them across the<br>seas something, however minuscule, which has gone into the making of<br>America. Without our common intellectual heritage, and the unity of<br>our basic outlook on life, there would be no substance in the joining<br>together of our country with Europe by the North Atlantic Pact. There<br>would be little assurance that this alliance will be firm enough to<br>resist aggression through the iron curtain which divides two diametri-<br>cally opposed civilizations. In a pamphlet issued in 1949, our State<br>Department says of the Pact that it &quot;has its roots in the common<br>heritage and civilization of the peoples living on both shores of the<br>North Atlantic Ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>As we honor the memory of this great scientist, let us reflect<br>upon the particular aspect of our common heritage which is most</p>
<p>vividly exemplified in his life - Western education. The theories</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Mipepeeratie sa &lt;a mt</p>
<p>ad practices evolved in the West to prepare children for adul thood<br>ere a unique feature never Spontaneously developed elsewhere, though<br>Western education has now been widely copied throughout the world.<br>I consider formal education the single most important element in<br>Western civilization, and for this reason: Of all methods devised<br>to train children to take their place in adult society, Western<br>education is the only one which concentrates primarily on developing<br>the mind and body of the child to its fullest potential anda concerns<br>itself only Secondarily with the utilitarian objective of teaching<br>him a saleable skill with which to earn his livelihood. In training<br>mind and body, Western education concentrates on developing an all-<br>around healthy adult, rather than a star athlete; it concentrates on<br>developing a person whose mind has been taught to think clearly,<br>logically and above all independently; it concentrates on making the</p>
<p>best use of the short period of time when human beings are most re-</p>
<p>ceptive to knowledge by Stocking young minds with as many facts abou:</p>
<p>the world in which they live as can be absorbed by them.</p>
<p>All other societies seek to train the young to follow in the fri...</p>
<p>steps of their elders; to adjust them to life as it is. They permit<br>very little deviation from accustomed patterns of life. This is the<br>main reason why all other great civilizations appear static when cor:<br>pared to that of the West. Whatever progress they may make escapes<br>the observer since it proceeds at a snail&#x27;s pace. The West alone</p>
<p>evolved the principle of academic freedom which allows intellectual<br>Pioneering on the frontiers of knowledge. Such Pioneering by minds</p>
<p>sharpened to think Sclentifically must inevitably increase knowledge</p>
<p>mn</p>
<p>eee</p>
<p>repidly. Knowledge indeed has always grown faster in the West than<br>anywhere else, Presently, it is estimated that we double our fund</p>
<p>of knowledge every fifteen years. The freedom to roam which is<br>granted to the mind of Western man is the single most important<br>reason that makes ours the most dynamic civilization in all the<br>world&#x27;s history. It accounts for our ability to provide more pec’ ©<br>with greater health, comfort, leisure, and the decencies of civilized<br>living than are possessed by people of other cultures. If we in this<br>country have achieved higher standards of living than Kurope, it has<br>been less because Americans are superior, than because of our great<br>good fortune in possessing a huge, fertile continent with vast<br>natural resources in which to apply techniques originated in Europe.<br>Despite far smaller resources in land and raw materials, Europe never<br>theless has achieved a very high standard of living, compared to the<br>rest of the world.</p>
<p>Europe is a mere spot on the map of the world; a crowded, poorly<br>endowed peninsula of the vast Asian heartland. Even today, mortally<br>wounded by two fraticidal wars, this small continent possesses wealth<br>and influence out of proportion to her size and natural endowment.<br>Until the outbreak of World War I, she was more powerful than all<br>non-European countries combined. Her economic and political power:<br>has always rested on her supremacy in matters of the mind, especially<br>in the sciences. Formal public education, public libraries, universi-<br>tiles, the principle of academic freedom, highly trained &quot;professions&quot;<br>with rigorous ethical codes - all these are European inventions.</p>
<p>All arise from sharpening of the human intellect; from widespread</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>recognition that knowledge is an end in itself, that a cultivated</p>
<p>mind changes the quality of life, lifts it to a higher level and,<br>by so doing, creates happiness. |</p>
<p>To evaluate the precious heritage we possess in Western educa-<br>tional theories and practices, we can do no better than to observe<br>the results of another great system of training the young, which in<br>its own sphere affected the quality of the life of a great civiliza~<br>tion quite as deeply as did Western education. I am referring to the<br>examination system of pre-revolutionary China which for many centuries<br>molded the mind of the Chinese people. It would be difficult to finda<br>educational objectives so completely at odds with the basic goals of<br>Western education than those evolved in Old China.</p>
<p>The famed examination system through which China&#x27;s public<br>officials were chosen from the most intelligent young men of the<br>country was not &quot;education&quot; as the term has always been understood<br>in the West. The system of examination through which a young man had<br>to pass, tested not his ability to think clearly and independently,<br>but his physical stamina and the capacity to reinterpret and re-<br>phrase elegantly the words of wisdom contained in the &quot;Four Books&quot;<br>and the &quot;Five Classics&quot;, China&#x27;s sacred literature. It was in effect<br>a gigantic conditioning process which molded China&#x27;s future leaders<br>into exact copies of an ideal - an ideal set down once and for all by<br>Confucious and his disciples in the fifth century B. C. It was the<br>most elaborate machinery ever devised by man to perpetuate the status<br>quo and to insure that the country&#x27;s leaders would think exactly</p>
<p>alike and never swerve from the path laid down by the sages of the</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>past. The men who emerged victoriously from the rigors of the</p>
<p>examination cells could be relied upon to add not one lota to the<br>nation&#x27;s moral, esthetic, and political doctrines; they could be<br>counted upon never to utter an original thought or to try to alter<br>the ordering of the Celestial Empire which was considered perfect,<br>hence in no need of improvement and eo ipso superior to all other<br>civilizations of the world.</p>
<p>Mental ossification - no matter how high the cultural level<br>will insure only a peaceful and agreeable existence, provided nothing<br>disturbs the even tenor of life. But, no matter how hard we may try,<br>life never stands still. Even if disturbing influences from the out-<br>side world are barred through the mightiest physical or mental<br>Chinese wall, internal developments will gradually alter the clreum- —<br>stances of life. By training, men&#x27;s minds will have become accustomed<br>to think in established grooves, they will lack the inventiveness and<br>initiative necessary to meet the requirements of the new situation.<br>Failure to readjust to changed circumstances will inevitably result<br>in national decline; in a steady downward leveling of the quality of<br>national life.</p>
<p>. This is what happened in China when outside influences and<br>domestic changes destroyed the foundations of the &quot;perfect ordering&quot;<br>of Chinese society. Perhaps the greatest factor in this downward<br>trend was the inability of China&#x27;s archaic society to raise its<br>technological levels when population increased. Once a point of<br>palance between land and population has been attained, national</p>
<p>standards of living inevitably decline unless there occurs</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>simultaneously a corresponding increase in technological proficiency.</p>
<p>Marco Polo&#x27;s China with its 60 million inhabitants was far more<br>civilized, orderly, and prosperous than 13th century Europe. Present-<br>day China with over 600 million inhabitants is only 23 times as<br>densely populated as the United States, but her low level of technology<br>cannot support this population on a level above bare subsistence. ,<br>When there is no margin of safety at all, men cannot be allowed to</p>
<p>be individualists - they must all labor like so many ants; else the<br>whole ant.,community will starve. Above all, hungry people will not<br>wait for the slow growth of industrialization that can be achieved</p>
<p>by democratic means. They become receptive to the persuasive siren<br>sone of Marxism which promises to perform miracles of rapid industrials -<br>zation - the,only way out, so they say, of certain starvation which<br>must come if people increase more rapidly than they are able to in-<br>crease their productivity. All the so-called under-developed<br>countries are in this predicament. But it has taken Mao to admit</p>
<p>this publicly, and with his usual logic and prutal forthrightness to<br>state how this tragic human problem can be turned to his own<br>advantage. china, he has said, does not fear an atomic war since</p>
<p>she would be better off if she lost half her present population.</p>
<p>Thus a hard-working, pright, and practical - perhaps too practical -<br>people has now redchea the ultimate human degradation when half of</p>
<p>her living human, beings are of no use except as potential atomic<br>cannon fodder which a heartless ruler will unhesitatingly sacrifice</p>
<p>in the sacred name. of Marxism and world conquest.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>It is the fashion today among leaders of newly emancipated</p>
<p>countries to castigate Western civilization as materialistic. In-<br>terestingly enough, it is the materialistic achievements of the West<br>which the leaders and people of these countries crave and which they<br>accept unhesitatingly, though seldom gratefully, from the hands of<br>the West. They do not wish to acknowledge the source of the West&#x27;s<br>ability to provide large populations with the comforts and pleasures<br>of civilized life. They fail to see that it 1s the type of mind<br>developed through Western educational methods which produces the<br>West&#x27;s high standard of living - the miracles of science which are<br>the envy of the rest of the world. Their protestations of superior<br>spirituality have a hollow sound. To my mind, all the philosophy,<br>all the art, all the esthetics of other great civilizations are as<br>nothing compared to the contribution made to the sum total of human<br>well-being and happiness by just one small product of Western educa-<br>tion - the single dose of penicillin which cures just one of the pain-~<br>ful diseases that is prevalent among backward people, but unknown in<br>the materialist West - yaws. Nor can I see evidence of materialism<br>in a civilization which produces dedicated men who will go out into<br>countries where life is less safe and pleasant than in their home<br>countries; who will go about in hot and unhealthy and uncomfortable<br>places and freely dispense these doses of penicillin to all who need<br>them. .</p>
<p>If men of other civilizations do not understand that nothing on<br>earth is so potent a force for good as a liberally trained mind in</p>
<p>aman of high character they can plead ignorance as their excuse.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>But we who have long benefited from the work done by such minds,<br>must not, we dare not fall into the error of believing that we can<br>retain the fruits of Western education without providing our children<br>with such an education. I have long been deeply concerned with the<br>danger to our future progress, and to the maintenance of our power-<br>ful position in the world, which could easily result from present-~<br>day trends in American education. Our common heritage of Western<br>educational ideals and techniques is not in high esteem among today&#x27;s<br>leaders in American public education. These leaders have already<br>succeeded alarmingly in their effort to detour American education<br>from the broad highway of Western education and into the dead-end of<br>life-adjustment, behavioral conditioning, and a leveling downwards of<br>curricula, students and teachers - all in the name of educational<br>democracy. There are many ways to put a brake on technological pro-<br>gress, but none so sure a5 producing young people who have not learned<br>to use their minds effectively. Substituting vocational training,<br>lessons in deportment and courses of preparation for leisure time<br>activities for the time-tested liberal arts course developed by the<br>West over two and a half millennia can easily do it.</p>
<p>I trust it comes as no surprise to you that I should have found<br>a point in this talk where American education can be conveniently<br>4Antroduced. I could not let the splendid opportunity go by - with<br>this distinguished &quot;captive&quot; audience before me. I have always found<br>history of practical help in what I attempt to do, and in the<br>Elder Cato I found a man who discovered how to get his own way. I</p>
<p>hasten to assure you that I have no such conceit as to compare myself</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>with the great Roman Censor. Perhaps he observed the astonishing</p>
<p>effectiveness of a drop of water in wearing away the hardest stone,<br>if it but drops continuously. No doubt all Rome got to be heartily<br>Sick of the one-track old gentleman who never rose in the Senate to<br>address that distinguished audience without first solemly warning<br>that Delenda est Carthago. Doubtless, in the end, it seemed easier<br>to go out and destroy Carthage than to continue listening to him.<br>And, so let me say: Delenda est life-adjustment conditioning; let us<br>bring standards of excellence to American education. Let us make<br>way for the liberal arts curriculum in our schools by eliminating<br>trivia and postponing vocational training until a child has received<br>a good general education.</p>
<p>A great American whose centennial celebration coincides with<br>that of Pupin, Theodore Roosevelt, once summed up what a liberal<br>education is and what it is good for: He said &quot;A cultural education<br>must include the classics. With these...every liberally educated<br>man Should be familiar. He should also be familiar with at least<br>one of the great modern culture languages...also...with a wide sweep<br>of general history and pre-history, for a liberal scholar should<br>certainly have clearly in mind the tremendous drama of man&#x27;s pro-<br>gress through the ages. A competent knowledge of science must also<br>be part of any really liberal education, so that...the primary facts<br>of the universe in which we live are vivid in his mind and form an<br>integral portion of his stock of knowledge. The man with such broad<br>liberal training is perhaps not apt to be a technical expert in any</p>
<p>special vocation; for his training stands outside the most direct</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>line to pecuniary reward. Yet he has a great place to fill, for he<br>has been fitted to become a leader in public thought, and a true<br>interpreter to the people of the developnent and meaning of our<br>civilization.&quot;</p>
<p>Let me close with this thought. Nations often behave not un-<br>like human beings. May I therefore be permitted to rephrase that<br>well-known remark of Donne&#x27;s and say: No country is an island, entire<br>of itself. We are a great country but we are not so great nor so<br>wise that we could not profit from observing the experiences of<br>older countries that are related to us in culture, particularly<br>when these countries have had a measure of Success, We are a young<br>country. We act somewhat like a young man who rejects everything his<br>parents stand for. To be sure this is a healthy phase in the process<br>of growing to maturity. But are we not now old enough to rediscover<br>our cultural affinity to the parent continent and to associate in-<br>tellectually with Europe in friendship and equality, exactly as grown-<br>up children do with their own parents? .</p>
<p>Mark Twain once remarked: “When I was a boy of fourteen, my<br>father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man<br>around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how</p>
<p>much the old man had learned in seven years,&quot;</p>
