      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his testimony before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on June 15, 1961, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover passionately details the rigorous safety culture and operational success of the Naval Reactors program. He highlights the program&#x27;s unique &quot;in-house headquarters organization&quot; responsible for every aspect of reactor design, development, construction, and training, emphasizing the crucial role of &quot;unlimited acceptance of complete responsibility by the individual.&quot; Rickover reports an impressive safety record with &quot;no accidents&quot; and &quot;no unusual doses of radiation&quot; across 21 submarines (to be 21 by June 18, 1961) and a total of 44 power reactors operated since May 31, 1953. He describes a demanding selection and training process where 25% of candidates fail, and outlines the meticulous procedure for qualifying personnel and new naval yards (like Puget Sound and Charleston), which takes at least 1.5 years. Rickover also addresses public concerns, stating that radioactive discharges in places like New London Harbor are well within drinking water tolerance, and attributing the SL-1 accident to avoidable factors such as inadequate training or faulty operation, rather than design alone, reiterating that &quot;all nuclear accidents that have happened so far could have been avoided if the training and operation had been adequate.&quot;</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL H. G. RECKOVER<br>at hearings before the<br>JOINT COMMITTEE ON ATOMIC ENERGY</p>
<p>June 15, 1961</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL H. G; RICKOVER<br>ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. ‘Thank yc; sir.</p>
<p>Representative Price. Sir, will you proceed with any<br>statement that you care to make on this subject of reactor safety.<br>‘Admiral Rickover. I have no prepared statement » Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>I believe you know that over a period of many years the Naval</p>
<p>Reactors Branch has had an in-house headquarters organization</p>
<p>responsible for the design and development of reactors » the</p>
<p>construction of the nuclear power plants that contain the reactors, the</p>
<p>training of officers and men, and for the constant observance. of</p>
<p>all the major and minor technical details that occur. We are</p>
<p>involved in these details and we follow them thoroughly on a day</p>
<p>by day basis. This is the way we make sure that our’ reactors are</p>
<p>designed and operating properly. .<br>Representative Price. How many nuclear reactors have !</p>
<p>been built under your supervision and how many of these are</p>
<p>in operation now?<br>Admiral Rickover. We now have 21 -- we will have by</p>
<p>Sunday, 21 submarines in operation. We have actually operated,</p>
<p>counting the initial and the replacement cores, 4h power reactors.</p>
<p>I believe this is probably more than all other power reactors in</p>
<p>the world put together.</p>
<p>Representative Price. You do not ‘know of any other</p>
<p>group that has built more reactors than the Naval Reactor</p>
<p>group?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I doubt there is, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Did you say 21 submarines<br>on Sunday?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes. We are going out on trials of the<br>ETHAN ALLEN, our sixth Polaris submarine early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Overall, 44 reactors?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. That includes the nuclear cores<br>that have been replaced.; it includes the eight cores in the aircraft<br>carrier, the two in the cruiser and the Shippingport reactor. So that<br>I have been responsible for a total of 44 nuclear power reactors.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. From atime — standpoint,<br>how far back does this take you?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. It goes back to May 31, 1953, when the<br>first reactor core of the NAUTILUS prototype started operating<br>at Arco, Idaho.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. The 44 reactors that you<br>mentioned are both land based and sea based.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. They are land based and seagoing, with<br>the great majority being seagoing.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. How many people would you say<br>have been employed in this effort, both civilian and<br>military-wise?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I- suppose if you took into account the</p>
<p>t ell</p>
<p>manufacturing industries there would be about 100,000</p>
<p>people. This is a rough figure, Mr. Van Zandt.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. To the best of your knowledge,<br>without having to go to records » have you had any accidents?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No, sir, fortunately we have had no<br>accidents.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Have you had any personnel<br>that absorbed any unusual doses of radiation?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No, sir, we have had none.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. You credit this » Of course,<br>to the reply that you made to Mr. Price a moment ago about<br>the type of an organization that you maintain day in and day<br>out for the purpose of safety?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Plus the fact that I have found favor<br>with this committee, with the Atamic Energy Commission, and in the<br>eyes.of the lord.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Thank you for including us.</p>
<p>Representative Price. The members of the House, are<br>going to have to leave for &amp; moment to answer the roll<br>call in the House, but Senator Jackson will continve the<br>—an</p>
<p>(Senator Jackson presiding)</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Admiral Rickover, you have maintained<br>an wieiehonleiea safety record. I wonder it you would indicate</p>
<p>some of the important factors that make this possible.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. The first factor is to have</p>
<p>people in charge who are thoroughly competent in the design and<br>operation of reactors, both the scientific and engineering aspects -<br>people who follow the work every minute of the day and night<br>and do not depend on anyone else to do this for them. The<br>second factor.is the acceptance of personal responsibility. Without<br>acceptance -- unlimited acceptance -- of complete responsibility by<br>the individual you cannot avoid ultimately having accidents,<br>Senator Jackson. Of course, the selection of people is<br>very vital.<br>Admiral Rickover. Yes, but that isa part of the respon- -<br>sibility, Senator Jackson. If you feel yourself to be<br>personally responsible for everything that happens, then, ‘to carry<br>out your responsibility you mst select and train the people and.<br>check on the operation of the ships. You must check on the<br>design, make sure of the excellence of the laboratories<br>“doing the work, see to it that the industrial organizations<br>manufacturing the. individual items are doing their job right,<br>prepare new specifications as necessary. You must be per-<br>sonally and emotionally involved in every single feature of the.<br>program, Otherwise, you will inevitably run into trouble,<br>Senator Jackson. Referring to Navy reactors, who is</p>
<p>responsible now?</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover., I am surprised you ask me such a</p>
<p>question, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson, I wanted it for the record. I think we<br>know.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I am responsibile, of course,</p>
<p>Mr. Ramey. Which hat are you wearing?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I don&#x27;t know. I am not wearing any<br>hat right now. I never know which hat I am wearing. I<br>understand there are job descriptions in the Navy and in the<br>AEC which say what I am supposed to do, but I have been too busy<br>to read them. I only know that I am responsible. That&#x27;s enough.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Do you do it better without wearing<br>a hat?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. You have demonstrated, I think, over<br>the years how to wear them and how not to wear them,</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, I understand the scientists have now com-<br>puted that 25 percent of the heat escaping from the body is from<br>the head. If I wore a hat it might slow me down.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, I have always been<br>amazed at your ability to select military personnel to do the<br>job on these submarines that is necessary. How much training</p>
<p>do you give these people before they actually find themselves</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>in a command slot, or even in an organization slot aboard<br>one of these nuclear powered subs?<br>Admiral Rickover. As you know, I have had quite a<br>problem with the Navy over the last 10 to 12 years in the<br>selection of personnel, particularly officers. But the Navy<br>now agrees thet “only intelligent people who are dedicated and<br>capable of improving should go into this program.<br>The Navy permits me to interview every officer who enters ;<br>the program and to make recommendations to the Chief of Naval<br>Personnel. Those selected, both officers and men, are given an<br>intensive course of training. Six months of this is theoretical<br>and six months practical.<br>Representative Van Zandt. Where does the training take<br>place?<br>Admiral Rickover. The six months theoretical training<br>takes place at New London, Connecticut, or at Mare Island,<br>California. The practical training takes place at the land<br>prototypes. These are located at West Milton, New York, where<br>we have the TRITON prototype; at Windsor, Connecticut, where there<br>is the TULLIBEE prototype; and at Arco, Idaho, where there is an<br>aircraft carrier prototype and the NAUTILUS prototype. All of the<br>men must learn the theory and the practical details of operating<br>@ nuclear power plant.<br>r’ But the education and training does not stop there,</p>
<p>because after they are assigned</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>to a ship they must continue to learn. Even after he is on a</p>
<p>ship he must remain qualified or he will be detached. We have<br>adopted a new practice for ships completing at a shipyard where,<br>instead of the shipyard or navy, yard employees testing the propulsion<br>plants, getting them ready to go to sea and operating the plants on<br>sea trials, we have that done by the officers and crew. This is<br>different than the practice on other naval]..ships where the yard<br>personnel do all the testing and conduct the sea trials.</p>
<p>About a month before a reactor is ready to go:critical, a<br>group of my. senior people and I spend two hase chaining the officers<br>and men in the engineering department -- about half the crew -- to<br>ascertain whether they are fully qualified. This examination is very<br>strict. If the crew is found to be qualified, they are authorized to<br>bring the reactor.critical. If we find them not qualified, we indicate<br>the areas of weakness and the additional work they must do, and we<br>re-examine them later.</p>
<p>On top of this I have been in charge of the first sea trials of<br>every nuclear ship. Senior members of the Naval Reactors Branch and<br>I are responsible for conducting the propulsion plant trials of each<br>ship.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. What percentage do you wash<br>out?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. About 25 percent of even the highly selected<br>people fail during our training course. Training is a most important<br>part of our program, because unless a man has the mental capacity to<br>learn modern technology and to understand the dangers inherent in</p>
<p>radiation he cannot do his job</p>
<p>216<br>adequately. This is a hard lesson for many to learn because<br>nuclear power, as does every new development, brings its attendant<br>train of problems. This must be recognized and taken into<br>account by all in authority.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. While on the subject of training,</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, I wonder if you might describe the conditions<br>precedent to the construction of a nuclear powered ship,<br>training, development and so on that takes place, and</p>
<p>what you are doing about it.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is a timely question, sir,<br>because the Navy is now in the process of training two new<br>yards: the Charleston Navy Yard and the Puget Sound Navy Yard.<br>The latter one. should be of particular interest to you.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. As you know, Admiral Rickover, I have<br>taken an interest in this for over a number of years, and<br>I have previously written to the Secretary of the Navy<br>asking Puget Sound Navy Yard be considered.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. May I briefly describe the process we<br>go through in training a new yard.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Yes.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. It so happens I discussed this silly<br>subject with Admiral Dolan, Commander of the sank Sound Navy<br>Yard this morning. At my request he is making a survey to find the<br>best people in the yard. He and his Production and Planning</p>
<p>Officers will personally interview the engineers</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>and select about 30 or 40 of the very best ones. Then I<br>will have senior members of my organization visit the yard<br>and personally interview each one of these engineers to<br>decide whether they are capable of being trained for nuclear<br>power work. Some of those selected will be trained at other</p>
<p>yards where nuclear ships are being built; they will become the</p>
<p>————</p>
<p>mucleus of the nuclear power organization at the Puget Sound</p>
<p>Yard.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. When do you plan to do this out there?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I expect to be at Puget Sound the end<br>of this month.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Around the 30th?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Somewhere around there.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. 29th or 30th?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, are you going to be out there,<br>sir?</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. You never know.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We will also have to train several hundred<br>of the yard workmen in special welding techniques and in radio-~<br>logical safety. This will be part of setting up the meclear organ-<br>ization.</p>
<p>. Senator Jackson. How many key engineers do you have<br>@ to train to start with?<br>Admiral Rickover, We will train somewhere between 30 and<br>50 key engineers. :</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. And then it will take several hundred.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Several hundred workmen especially<br>trained: to do this work, yes, oir.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Do you send the key engineers to yards<br>that have had previous experience?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. Some will be sent to</p>
<p>-aebivities such as‘ our nuclear. laboratories and yards. Some</p>
<p>will be trained locally.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Then the workmen will be trained right</p>
<p>in the yard?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. The workmen, with a few exceptions,</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>-&#x27; willbe trained in the yard. I will. assign. an experienced officer</p>
<p>from my organization to be in charge of the nuclear work at<br>Puget Sound. |</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. I understand that the program you are<br>talking about takes 4 year and a half.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. It takes at least a year and &amp; half for<br>a yard that already has sufficient human potential. Ifa yard<br>does not have this personnel potential it will take sanntth longer.<br>They. will have to acquire people. I know from my own experience<br>thet Puget Sound is 6 good yard. You ought to be proud to come<br>from a State which has such a Yard.</p>
<p>-Senater Jackson: , That is why I wrote the letter to the<br>Secretary of the wary: It was not because the Yard was</p>
<p>locdted in the State. It ie one of these outstanding Yards.</p>
<p>I wes glad to pave your corroboration of my campletely<br>natural interest in this problen.<br>There is one other matter that I want to inquire about,<br>Admiral Rickover, How do you resolve the Navy&#x27;s responsi-<br>bility for operating nuclear ships with the Atomic mergy<br>Commission&#x27;s responsibilities which require that standards |<br>and adequate regulations are properly set to protect the<br>public?<br>Admiral Rickover. The Atomic Energy Cammission, as you<br>have just said, sir, is responsible for the over-all safety<br>of all nuclear power plants and installations. My primary<br>duty is with the Atomic knergy Commission. There, I am in charge<br>of the Naval Reactors Branch which has to do with the design of<br>nuclear propulsion plants, the nuclear laboratories, the land proto-<br>types, and the training of naval personnel for nuclear duty. I have<br>additional duty in the Navy Department as Assistant Chief of the<br>Bureau of Ships where I am responsible for the construction of the<br>nuclear part of the propulsion plant, and for thé testing and<br>mperation ofthe nuclear plants. ‘The Atomic Energy Commission has<br>agreed that the AEC laboratories will supply people to help in this<br>function. Because I head the work in the AEC and in the Navy, ‘these<br>two organizations, the AEC and the Navy, are combined in this effort.<br>In this way the work is done without duplication and with minimum cost.<br>As you know, whenever one of our new types of plants is ready to<br>go critical we notify the Iicensing and Regulation Division of the AKC.<br>We also notify the Reactor Safeguards Committee, and we have these two<br>evans evaluate our design and operating procedures. No ship goes to</p>
<p>sea without having had such an investigation.</p>
<p>They get into such questions as whether a ship can operate out<br>gg: @pavtiowlar part,.at what power level it ‘can operate |<br>in that particular area and so one</p>
<p>We go over this in detail with them before each new class of</p>
<p>‘maclear ship goes into operation. This is a continuing process,<br>and ‘may require several actions by the Reactor Safeguards Com-<br>mittee.</p>
<p>_ In the case of the Nautilus, we had four separate reviews by<br>the Reactor Safeguards Committee, I think we have had nearly 40<br>sessions with this Committee about various aspects of our’ reactor plant de-<br>stgne: and: operations. We keep the Committee currently informed<br>of what is going on. We very much welcome their advice. We<br>have great respect for their abilities. They are frequently hard<br>on us, but then they have a difficult job to do and they have to<br>be tough. We have found they are quite helpful and fair +o us.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. One other question in this general<br>areas One of the problems concerning the committees ia the<br>pinpointing of responsibility in the event of nuclear accidents.<br>We had the one at Arco, the Sl-l. How can the Joint Conmittee<br>ascertain what individual or individuals are responsible for<br>a speckfic project.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is very simple. ‘The man who comes up<br>and asks you for money is the one who is responsible.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Is he, necessarily? He asks for money</p>
<p>but then someone else is operating it and running it.</p>
<p>PE a oe as ee nee oN</p>
<p>“answer is self evident.</p>
<p>221<br>Admiral Rickover. Someone else is operating it? What<br>does he want, just the glory, then when something goes wrong<br>someone else is responsible?</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. I wanted to give you this opportunity<br>to comment on the problem that we face here in the committee.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I do not believe you face a problem</p>
<p>there. I think you are creating a problem for yourselves. The</p>
<p>Log Rieti ah</p>
<p>Mr. Ramey. On the question of responsibility for regulations<br>and for operational safety in the Navy, as I recall last year,<br>or the year before, we gathered that there may have been some<br>problems with respect to more or less standardized Navy safety<br>practices that were not adapted to the nuclear problem. In<br>other words, that there was some inclination in the Navy to look<br>at safety as a standardized aspect across the board.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Ramey, you know that military<br>people traditionally like to operate their equipment, weapons<br>and ships in the way they have been used to and without inter-<br>ference from outside. It is very difficult for people who have<br>spent the greater part of their lives in a pre-scientific age ©<br>to understand that they are now dealing with a force that must be<br>handled in an entirely different manner than they have been<br>accustomed, This is recognized by the top military and civilian</p>
<p>people, It is not thoroughly recognized by others who believe</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>their prerogatives to be invaded when someone suggests. to. them that<br>if you do such and such a thing you may incur danger. This</p>
<p>idea is very difficult to get across. We have been fairly<br>successful in convincing some people of these truths; in some</p>
<p>cases we have not. I think if your committee and if the AEC do<br>not constantly follow this matter, the situation will inevit-</p>
<p>ably deteriorate, It is hard to get people to understand that</p>
<p>when they deal with radiation they are not dealing with or-</p>
<p>dinary phenomena which can merely do local ,itransitory harm.</p>
<p>With radiation you can also do harm to posterity. This is<br>a concept which is difficult for many to understand,</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, probably the greatest<br>concentration of reactor activity from the standpoint of<br>Naval vessels is at New London and Groton, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. In your opinion, do you think<br>that the regulation applied, both civilian and military-wise,<br>is adequate to protect the safety of the population in that<br>area?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir, it is. New London was<br>chosen as.a home port for our nuclear submarines, You must rem-</p>
<p>ember</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>that a dead reactor, that is, one that is not operating is not<br>dangerous if it is properly designed and maintained. So the fact<br>that you have five or ten reactors in an area, with only: one or<br>two operating, does not mean that you have five or ten potentially<br>dangerous cases.</p>
<p>We have issued specific instructions on the operation and<br>maintenance of our reactors. We have also issued instruction books<br>that have been very carefully prepared by our laboratories and checked<br>by us. The operators are thoroughly inbtructed and examined. No one<br>is allowed to operate one of our reactors unless he is thoroughly<br>qualified. Also, proper supervision must be present to assure that<br>all specific instructions and procedures are followed.</p>
<p>We have done everything humanly possible to prevent accidents.<br>Furthermore, a Navy Order provides that no one unqualified may .<br>work on a reactor, nor can any change be made in any reactor without<br>prior official authorization. As you are aware, sir, we train the<br>officers in our schools, except the Commanding Officers who are<br>trained right in my own headquarters organization. These spend a<br>year with my leading people. We teach them and indoctrinate them in<br>nuclear power as well as in the principles of ship and tiiskinbey design.<br>The Commanding Officers spend a considerable part of their time during<br>this year at a land prototype where they learn to operate the plant.<br>While they are at the prototype, for several weeks at a time, they<br>work 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>The fact that a nuclear ship may go to sea for&#x27;two months at a time,<br>0 and be away from the United States, does not in itself. relieve me of my<br>reaponnibility even though an operational commander has charge. I</p>
<p>have been responsible for</p>
<p>22k</p>
<p>the design of the reactor plant, the training of the crew, the<br>installation and test, the issuance of instructions. So no matter<br>where an accident might happen, I am still personally responsible.<br>Responsibility is a unique concept: it can only reside and inhere<br>in a single individual. You may share it with others, but your<br>portion is not diminished. You may delegate it, but it is still with<br>you. You may disclaim it, but you cannot divest yourself of it.<br>Even if you do not recognize it or admit its présence, you cannot<br>escape it. If responsibility is rightfully yours, no evasion, or<br>ignorance or passing the blame can shift the vecaee to someone else.<br>Unless you can point your finger at the man who is responsible when<br>something goes wrong, then you&#x27; have never had anyone really résponsible.<br>Representative Van Zandt. Going back again to the New London-<br>Groton area, what about the contamination of the waters?<br>Admiral Rickover. We keep a record of all radioactive water.<br>Representative Van Zandt. I am speaking of the Bay.<br>Admiral Rickover. I am glad you asked that, sir. We keep a<br>record of the minor amount of water that is discharged from each<br>submarine. In fact, even the water going right through; the reactor<br>while it is operating is generally so pure from a radioactivity wiend-<br>point that it is within drinking water tolerance. This is so because<br>of the way we design our reactor plants. ‘The amount of radioactivity —<br>we have discharged into New London harbor has been checked by the local<br>authorities, by the Comnecticut State Department of Health end by ‘the<br>U. S. Public Health Service and it is well within drinking water<br>tolerance. We have never had a single case where it has been otherwise.<br>fo give you another example, the amount of radioactivity being</p>
<p>discharged into the Ohio River from the Shippingport&#x27; reactor is about<br>one-millionth the radioactivity that</p>
<p>225<br>is discharged into the Columbia River by the Hanford Reactors.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Admiral, is it not true that ina<br>nuclear powered submarine -- we have experience yet Aiasaedss as<br>far as surface ships are concerned -- the control room is manned<br>around the clock.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. Whether the ship is “oe<br>or whether it is at port?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover., We have qualified people on board at all<br>times, even during overhaul, yes, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. You mentioned the contamination in the<br>Columbia in comparison with your record in connection with the<br>nuclear powered submarines. I want to say that the proposed<br>dual purpose reactor will help to eliminate that situation.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir, I know that. I am glad you<br>put in a plug for your State.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. One more question, Admiral.<br>Over a period of years there has been some resistance on the<br>part of those who control harbors in foreign countries<br>admitting nuclear powered submarines. I take it from your<br>statement that there is nothing to fear as far as tid water</p>
<p>of the harbor is concerned from the standpoint of</p>
<p>226<br>contamination, But there is always the possibility of<br>an accident, What would you say the ratio of the accident is?<br>Admiral Rickover. I do not think you can talk about<br>the ratio of an accident. It is my firm conviction that<br>a reactor properly designed and properly operated will not<br>have an accident. Nevertheless, since there is: always such<br>a potential, I consider it unwise and unnecessary: to-send a nuclear<br>powered ship into a foreign port unless there is a real purpose or a<br>need. I would like to amplify this because it is an issue which<br>is under discussion and will continue to be under discussion from<br>now on. For example, suppose you have a choice of sending a maclear.<br>powered ship into one of two ports, one being a populated area or<br>~ ¢lese to a populated area and one is not. I would always pick the<br>one that is less densely populated. =<br>We try in the Navy only to send ships into ports, ox: we:<br>should, where there is a military petenettys But military =<br>. ‘necesaity can mean several things. In wartime, ‘of course,<br>. the igigue woul would not. japtene In peacetime it may be connected.»,<br>with fleet operations. We may want to put ships in the<br>Mediterranean, and we will have to put nuclear ships into ports<br>along with the other ships, for logistic support and because<br>we have to give our sailors liberty, ‘We also have to shut down<br>various parts of the plants for maintenance and repair purposes.<br>I believe there is justification for sending ships into<br>ports for these purposes. But we should always remember that there</p>
<p>is some finite chance ef accident. So we gnould not take wmecessary ,<br>daennes where they are avoidable.</p>
<p>I do not know whether I have answered your question exactly. I<br>am not fearful of contaminating harbor waters. ‘I’ am not really<br>tearful of any accident, although vith e nuclear power plant, “if<br>At does hava an accident, the the consequences will be-pere serious<br>‘tian with any other type ef pover plant. *</p>
<p>Representative Wan Zandt. One final gensiten:</p>
<p>I know you will probably make 4 frank statement: —<br>on what you read in the press and probably the access you<br>mave. haa ‘to official records, what is your opinion of ‘he</p>
<p>accident :at Arco?</p>
<p>ilecel, -Rickower « I believe ‘it was an avoidable<br>accident... here may have been scue errors dn design. There may<br>have been inadequate training or faulty dooration: I think that<br>+o have an accident you have to have 4&amp; combination of several<br>circumstances. Qne error by itself will not cause an acdident.<br>‘For example, in thet reactor, had there been adequate: training, ant |<br>‘proper operation the design slone would have not. -eaused, the accident.<br>Broper. spe even with feulty design could. have prevented the<br>—sccldent. Good supervision could have prevented the eceident, ‘ren<br>with faulty: design “ana. ‘pad. greining- aul nuclear accidents that have<br>, happened so far could have been avoided if the training and operation</p>
<p>had been adequate.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. The other day we received informa-<br>tion as to the training of the military personnel who lost their<br>lives in the Arco accident. At that time I was of the opinion<br>that the training they received in no way compared with the<br>training that you required of Naval personnel.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Van Zandt, I am not familiar with the<br>training they had.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zandt. This is my own opinion.</p>
<p>Kdmiral Rickover. I would go back further than that. I think<br>you have to go back to the man who came up here and asked you to<br>appropriate for that reactor. You had a right to assume at that</p>
<p>point when you were recommending assignment of Government funds</p>
<p>to him, that he was going to be responsible for it.</p>
<p>I suggest that from now on when a man comes to your Committee |<br>and requests money, you ask him, &quot;what is going to be your responsi-<br>bility?&quot; If he is not responsible, you should not give him the money.<br>Find out who is responsible. If no one is responsible, then Mr. Dillon<br>will be very happy.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. Thank you, Admiral Rickover. We appreciate<br>having your helpful testimony today.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. With<br>your permission I would like to include in the record a summary of<br>how the AEC and the Navy operate with respect to the Naval Nuclear<br>Propulsion Program.</p>
<p>Senator Jackson. You may include it in the record. . The last</p>
<p>» Witness this afternoon, Mr. William Mitchell, Consultant to the</p>
<p>committee and former</p>
<p>&#x27; .General Counsel to the Atomic Energy Commission, Professor</p>
<p>Cavers, is here also.</p>
