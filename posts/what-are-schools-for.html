      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman Rickover&#x27;s speech, &quot;WHAT ARE SCHOOLS FOR?&quot;, delivers a scathing critique of American education, asserting that its fundamental flaws, particularly the inadequate preparation of students in core subjects, directly impacted his efforts to develop nuclear propulsion for the Navy. He highlights his personal experience of having to establish remedial schools to teach basic math, science, and engineering to college graduates. Rickover contrasts the U.S. system with European and Japanese models, which he found superior in efficiency and effectiveness for all students, noting that &quot;three years of schooling abroad compar[es] roughly to four here.&quot; He attributes America&#x27;s educational woes and alarming illiteracy rates—citing &quot;24 million &#x27;functional&#x27; illiterates&quot; and the U.S. lagging decades behind countries like Iceland and Germany in achieving widespread literacy—to the pervasive influence of &quot;progressive education&quot; and &quot;dogmatic egalitarianism.&quot; Rickover argues that this philosophy, championed by figures like John Dewey, has misguidedly prioritized &quot;social justice&quot; and &quot;togetherness&quot; over academic rigor and the cultivation of individual talent, despite the U.S. investing over &quot;$70 billion dollars&quot; annually and education spending increasing &quot;489%!&quot; since 1952. Referencing Dr. Roger A. Freeman&#x27;s study, he concludes that this costly and inefficient system, which neglects the special schooling needed for its &quot;abler children,&quot; is ultimately &quot;suicidal&quot; for a technologically dependent nation.</p>

        <p>WHAT ARE SCHOOLS FOR?</p>

<p>I trust you were aware--when you asked to have me as a speaker--that you were inviting a severe critic of our schools and could therefore not expect to hear much that would cheer the spirit or flatter your sensibilities.</p>

<p>I did not become a critic of American education by choice. Its deficiencies impressed themselves forcibly upon me because of the work I had to do. The task assigned me a quarter of a century ago--to develop nuclear propulsion for the Navy--could be accomplished only with the help of educated talent of high caliber. Well educated men, thoroughly grounded in the fundamentals of their specialized fields, were needed for the scientific and engineering job of designing and supervising construction, as well as for the naval job of operating our nuclear ships. These men would of course--like myself--have to learn nuclear technology on the job, for it did not yet exist; we had to develop it ourselves. The fundamental grounding however was indispensable, and it was just this that I found sadly lacking. Few among those anxious to join our program had any solid foundation in mathematics, science, engineering or, for that matter, the liberal arts, despite long years of schooling and top grades. I could find the requisite intelligence and interest, but before this could be brought to bear on our technical problems, I had to set up schools to teach what in any proper educational system should have been learned in high school and college. Mine was not a unique experience. Others also find it necessary to provide remedial instruction for employees before training them for specific technical jobs.</p>

<p>Thousands of engineers, officers, and men have passed through our schools. We pick them with utmost care among those ranking at the top of their college classes, yet we find few, very few, whose good minds have had anything approximating the kind of education that would have been suitable to their capacities. In my terms, nearly all were under-achievers when we took them on--chiefly because they had never before encountered the kind of intellectual challenge that would have motivated them to stretch their minds. It became obvious to me that American education does not provide adequately for the special needs of our talented youth, and that something ought to be done to make it more responsive.</p>

<p>When an engineer like myself--or a scientist, a mathematician, a medical man--looks for ideas on how the performance of his profession might be improved, he is never bound by national frontiers. Like everyone else, he would naturally like to believe that his country ranks first in the field of his special expertise. But if it does not, he will not hesitate to adopt better methods or procedures, no matter where they have been developed.</p>

<p>To examine whether the school systems of other advanced countries did better by their children than ours, whether something might be learned from them, seemed to me a sensible thing to do. I find it difficult to understand why American educationists are so bitterly opposed to such comparisons; educators elsewhere show considerable interest in what is being done educationally throughout the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Whenever I broached the matter, the stock reply was that ours were "the best schools in the world." This is an excellent public relations technique since it takes the wind out of the case a critic might make against American education. Foreign school systems, our educators assured me, were of no relevance for us, for we alone educated all our children while foreign schools educated only an elite. How then could one compare their aristocratic system with our common schooling? I could get no aid on my inquiries from educational officialdom in this country though fortunately foreign schoolmen were most helpful, patient and kind. I was made to feel that I was meddling in matters that were none of my business.</p>

<p>But I am a stubborn man. The education of our children has always seemed to me the most important business of every citizen of this country. One of the glories of our free society is that public agencies are accountable to the American people.</p>

<p>So I went ahead anyway and spent a dozen or so years of such leisure time as I could find in a 70-hour work week looking into European school systems--English, Dutch, Swiss, Russian, in particular. I found that all of them made better provision than we for the education of their abler students. I was chiefly interested in comparing achievements here and abroad among young people who had the ability and the necessary drive to pursue studies above the elementary level, but it was at once evident that European school systems also do better by their average and below average students. Moreover, contrary to all I had been told, schooling abroad, to the highest levels was open to all, free of charge. In terms of time and money invested--the time of teachers and students, and the money of taxpayers, all were far more efficient than our school system--three years of schooling abroad comparing roughly to four here, as measured by actual time devoted to class instruction.</p>

<p>To take but one instance of greater efficiency, every European child learns to read and write, except the most severely retarded; an illiterate person is a Seven Day Wonder. Here, alas, he is not. Difficult as it was to come by hard facts, literacy statistics being generally fudged, I knew full well that considerable illiteracy lingered on in this country. We hide the fact by arbitrarily declaring anyone literate who has completed five years of schooling. Thus the census shows a 2.4% illiteracy rate--far above that of Europe and Japan, and far below the true situation in this country. Recently, the Office of Education admitted that there were 24 million "functional" illiterates or about 12% of our population, but there is evidence that even this figure underestimates the situation. Moreover, to call the inability to read or write a simple sentence "functional" illiteracy may take the sting out of a word that by rights has no place in a civilized country.</p>

<p>I have yet to see so much as a single statement conceding that this illiteracy rate sets us off from other civilized countries, that it may have something to do with the way we go about educating our children, and that--just conceivably--we might consider investigating why it is that English, German, French, Swiss, Japanese children master the three "Rs" and much history, natural science, perhaps even a foreign language besides, during the 7 to 9 years of free compulsory elementary education--for generations the minimum schooling for everyone in those countries. Instead of investigating how they go about educating all their children to literacy and numeracy, we keep on spending more and more billions of tax dollars on costly experiments, research projects, gimmicks and the like. I gather that more than half the Federal educational subsidies go into things of this kind. The futility of most of these projects has been well documented in a careful study by Dr. Roger A. Freeman, recently a special White House Assistant and an influential force in the educational field. His study is in the Congressional Record of April 24, 1969. Freeman points out that all the vast data we have on education deals with input--capital cost of buildings, number of gymnasiums, number of children per class, number of children taking driver training, annual cost per child, etc. We alone have no reliable information on educational output--what the children learn.</p>

<p>In other countries, the introduction of universal, free, compulsory elementary schooling automatically wiped out illiteracy. Our educationists have blown up the simple business of learning to read into an extraordinarily difficult and complex task, and thrown much of the blame for their own failure on parents and society. European and Japanese--and Russian--children learn to read and write even when they come from the poorest segments of the population--and poverty abroad is a good deal grimmer and more widespread than here. They learn the three "Rs" even though there are no books in their homes and their hardworking parents have no time to read them bed-time stories or help do their arithmetic homework! They are carried through the elementary schools without costly "compensatory" pre-school programs reaching ever farther back towards infancy.</p>

<p>It is nothing short of fantastic that currently the whole nation is being urged to join the campaign and help the schools win for every American child the "right to read" by 1980 or thereabouts--180 years after Iceland became wholly literate, 120 years after Germany and 60 years after Japan reached that goal! Our schools, we are told, need the support of the media, the entertainment world, the sports world, the publishers, and business; there must be programs training students and mothers to serve as volunteer part-time teachers--I am quoting statements emanating from the highest HEW echelons. And this despite the fact that last year we invested more than 70 billion dollars in education. This works out to more than $900 per child per annum. Since 1952--in but 19 years--the schools' revenues rose from under 6 to over 30 billion dollars, a rate twice as fast as school enrollment and prices combined. To give you a basis for comparison, during that same period defense expenditures barely kept up with rising prices. Or to put it differently, while the defense share of all governmental expenditures--federal, state, local--went up 57%, that for education went up 489%! In a report to the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress last October, Dr. Freeman brought out the astonishing fact that "with only 6% of the world's population, and between 1/4 and 1/3 of developed resources, the people of the United States are now investing in education almost as much--and possibly as much--as all of the other nations combined." I think he is justified in his conclusion that "nothing testifies more eloquently to the American faith in education than the priority which the people have granted it, in financial terms." So much for the current accusations by the schoolmen that illiteracy is a failure, not of the educational system but of society at large.</p>

<p>The slogan one hears so much nowadays is that the goal of the 1970's must be to win for every American child the "right to read", as if barricades had to be stormed to wrest this right from wicked enemies, to be handed--like a trophy--to the anxiously waiting American child. This slogan, to my mind reveals the basic flaw in the thinking of American educationists which is chiefly responsible for the failure of our schools. It is a flaw that goes back to the take-over of the school system by Dewey and the progressives, for whom education was a species of "consumer good" to be shared out equally, rather than earned by individual effort. It was at this point that American education took the wrong turn and forgot what schools are really for. This is why I believe it useful to examine this question; this is why I have chosen it as the title of my speech.</p>

<p>Why do we and all other advanced nations maintain expensive educational establishments? Necessity, is the answer, sheer necessity. Formal schooling, from elementary to university education, is concomitant with civilization. So much so, that without it primitive people cannot catch up with the civilized world. With it any society, any individual, has the means for rapid advancement.</p>

<p>A civilized society needs an educated people. If it neglects its schools or distorts the purpose of public education for ends other than genuine schooling it will decline. The technological apparatus may remain intact in appearance, but inwardly there is a return to primitivism.</p>

<p>Of course, in some ways it is a strange idea that society, not the parent, should be responsible for getting children into school and for paying to have them educated. Since time immemorial the education of their offspring has been a parental responsibility. Begetting children imposed the duty not only to feed, clothe, house them, and take care of their health, but also to prepare them for life by training them for the tasks of adulthood. The compelling reason why the financial burden of schooling has been shifted from the parent to his fellow citizens is that social progress raises educational requirements, and most families cannot meet these requirements by their own efforts. Let me elaborate:</p>

<p>In primitive societies children are educated by untrained adults--parents, relatives, and neighbors. In the language of American progressive education, they "learn by doing," by working alongside adults. Their classroom is the home, the workshop, the community
