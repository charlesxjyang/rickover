      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s June 1980 address, titled &quot;DELIVERY COPY,&quot; provides a stark assessment of the growing Soviet naval threat and advocates for a robust, high-quality U.S. defense posture. Rickover details the unparalleled Soviet naval expansion under Admiral Gorshkov since 1958, noting their construction of over 1800 new ships and combatant craft, and specifically highlighting their numerical superiority in submarines (nearly three times as many as the U.S., with 5 construction yards to America&#x27;s 2). He argues that since the U.S. cannot match Soviet numbers, it must prioritize the quality and capability of its ships, emphasizing an offensive strategy and the critical need for flexible, nuclear-powered vessels. Rickover points to the cost-effectiveness and operational advantages of Los Angeles-class attack submarines (SSN688) over slower alternatives, underscores the importance of Trident ballistic missile submarines for strategic deterrence and independent basing, and advocates for nuclear-powered AEGIS cruisers to ensure mobility and minimize logistical vulnerability for carrier task forces in high-threat areas. He concludes by stressing the vital importance of retaining experienced, nuclear-trained naval personnel through adequate pay and benefits, and appeals to Congress to uphold its responsibility in maintaining national defense for the nation&#x27;s survival.</p>

<p>REMARKS BY ADMIRAL H, G, RICKOVER<br>BEFORE THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE<br>DEFENSE BREAKFAST SEMINAR<br>WEDNESDAY, 4 JUNE 1980</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME OF MY VIEWS<br>ON CURRENT TOPICS AFFECTING OUR DEFENSE POSTURE AND THE FUTURE<br>OF OUR COUNTRY. THE VIEWS I WILL EXPRESS ARE MY OWN FROM MY<br>PERSPECTIVE AFTER 50 YEARS AS A NAVAL OFFICER, ENGINEER, ANN<br>STUDENT OF HISTORY,</p>
<p>I WILL NOT DWELL ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE NAVAL NUCLEAR<br>PROPULSION PROGRAM I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR BECAUSE I HAVE TESTIFIED<br>ON THAT SUBJECT BEFORE SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES, I WOULN<br>LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THOUGHTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOVIET<br>NAVAL THREAT AS COMPARED TO OUR NAVAL STRENGTH,</p>
<p>THE SOVIET NAVAL THREAT</p>
<p>RECENT SOVIET AGGRESSION IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BROUGHT RENEWED<br>REALIZATION OF SOVIET INTENTIONS FOR WCRLD POWER AND CONCERN<br>FOR THE ADEQUACY OF OUR OWN DEFENSE, WHAT MANY MAY NOT REALIZE<br>IS THAT THE SOVIET THREAT IN NAVAL POWER, AS IN OTHER AREAS, HAS<br>BEEN GROWING MORE OMINOUS, PAST WARNINGS BY MANY IN THE MILITARY<br>HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH SOME INDIFFERENCE, HOWEVER, TODAY WE ARE</p>
<p>F FACED WITH A NAVAL THREAT MORE SERIOUS THAN ANY SINCE WORLD<br>WAR II,</p>
<p>TWENTY-FOUR YEARS AGO, ADMIRAL GORSHKOV, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF<br>OF THE SOVIET NAVY, HEADED A NAVY WHICH WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A<br>DEFENSE ORIENTED EXTENSION OF THE SOVIET ARMY, UNDER HIM, THE<br>SOVIET NAVY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED, SINCE 1958, THE SOVIETS HAVE<br>BUILT OVER 1800 NEW SHIPS AND COMBATANT CRAFT, A PROGRAM OF NAVAL<br>EXPANSION THAT SURPASSES THE EFFORTS OF ANY OTHER NAVAL POWER,<br>FROM A DEFENSIVE FLEET IN WORLD WAR II, IT HAS EVOLVED INTO A<br>MAJOR BLUE-WATER NAVY THAT CHALLENGES THE U.S. FOP CONTROL ALMOST<br>EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THE SOVIET MOMENTUM FOR SUPERIORITY IN<br>NAVAL WARFARE CONTINUES WHILE U.S, NAVAL PLANS FLUCTUATE EVERY<br>YEAR, NEVER IN PEACETIME HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING COMPARABLE TO<br>THE GROWTH OF THE RUSSIAN NAVAL POWER, THIS CERTAINLY RAISES<br>CONCERN OVER THE SOVIET DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE PEACE,</p>
<p>HERE ARE SOME COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THESE<br>CONCERNS,</p>
<p>0 IN THE PAST 10 YEARS THE SOVIETS HAVE BUILT OVER 909<br>MAJOR AND MINOR SURFACE COMBATANTS, MINE WARFARE, AND<br>AMPHIBIOUS SHIPS, WHILE THE U.S, HAS BUILT 100, OR<br>JUST OVER 10 PERCENT AS MANY,</p>
<p>o THE SOVIETS HAVE MORE MAJOR SURFACE COMBATANTS THAN WE,<br>AND ARE INTRODUCING NEW SHIPS AT A GREATER RATE, THESE<br>INCLUDE 4 NEW CLASSES OF CRUISERS, ONE OF WHICH WILL LIKELY<br>BE NUCLEAR POWERED, AT ABOUT 22,090 TONS, IT NOULD BE THE<br>WORLD&#x27;S LARGEST NUCLEAR POWERED CRUISER AND WILL CARRY A<br>FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF WEAPONS,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>THE SOVIETS HAVE ALMOST 3 TIMES AS MANY SUBMARINES<br>AND ONE-THIRD MORE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES,</p>
<p>o THEY HAVE 5 SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION YARDS; WE HAVE<br>TWO, ALL U.S, SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION CAPACITY<br>COULD FIT INTO ONE SOVIET SUBMARINE YARD,</p>
<p>o SINCE 1970, THEY HAVE INTRODUCED 10 NEW SUBMARINE<br>DESIGNS; THE U.S, THO, DURING THIS PERIOD, THE<br>SOVIETS HAVE PUT TO SEA MORE NEW DESIGN SUBMARINES<br>THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY DURING A COMPARABLE PERIOD<br>IN ALL OF NAVAL HISTORY,</p>
<p>o THEIR PROGRAM HAS STRONG SUPPORT AND VIRTUALLY<br>UNLIMITED FUNDING, THEY ARE STRIVING FOR QUALITATIVE<br>SUPERIORITY. THEY ALREADY HAVE NUMERICAL SUPERIORITY,<br>OUR PROGRAM IS UNCERTAIN AND DOES NOT CET STRONG<br>SUPPORT FROM THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT,</p>
<p>ED 10 MAINTAIN A VIABLE U.S ET</p>
<p>ANY COMPARISON OF THE SOVIET AND U.S, NAVY MUST BE VIEWED<br>FROM THE CONTEXT THAT WE ARE A MARITIME POWER DEPENDENT UPON<br>BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN SEA LANES OF COMMUNICATION NECESSARY<br>TO CONDUCT MILITARY OPERATIONS OVERSEAS AND TO SUPPORT OUR<br>ALLIES. THE MISSION OF OUR NAVY IS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT ONE THAN<br>THAT OF THE SOVIETS OF DENYING US FREE USE OF THE SEAS,</p>
<p>WE HAVE GIVEN UP ANY CHANCE OF MATCHING THE SOVIET NAVY<br>IN NUMBERS OF SHIPS, THEREFORE, THE QUALITY OF CUR SHIPS<br>MUST BE SUPERIOR, IT IS AXIOMATIC THAT A NATION DEPENDENT ON<br>THE QUALITY OF ITS WEAPONS MUST DESIGN ITS FORCES AROUND AN<br>OFFENSIVE STRATEGY IF IT IS TO PREVAIL OVER A NUMERICALLY<br>SUPERIOR FOE, IT CANNOT AFFORD TO FIGHT A DEFENSIVE WAR OF<br>ATTRITION,</p>
<p>NEED FOR FLEXIBLE AND CAPABLE SHIPS</p>
<p>A FEW YEARS AGO, FEW PEOPLE GAVE MUCH THOUGHT TO DEPLOYING<br>NAVAL FORCES TO THE INDIAN OCEAN TO PROTECT QUR INTERESTS, TODAY<br>THAT HAS BECOME A REALITY, FEI APPRECIATE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS<br>TO MAINTAIN A SIGNIFICANT NAVAL FORCE HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD,<br>THE SUPPLY LINE, PARTICULARLY FOR OIL FIRED SHIPS, IS TENUOUS,<br>THERE MAY BE A NEW REALIZATION THAT WAR OF ATTRITION AT SEA IS<br>A REAL POSSIBILITY. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, OUR NAVAL FORCES<br>MUST BE ABLE TO DEFEND THE SEA LANES AND CARRY THE BATTLE TO<br>THE ENEMY AS WELL, IN A GLOBAL WARTIME SITUATION WE WILL NOT<br>HAVE THE TIME TO BUILD THE COMPLEX SHIPS WE NEED THE WAY WE<br>DID IN THE LAST WORLD WAR, THE SHIPS WE BUILD IN PEACETIME<br>ARE THOSE WE WILL HAVE TO RELY UPON IN THE EVENT OF HOSTILITIES,</p>
<p>IF WE MISCALCULATE OR SUCCUMB TO THE EASY ECONOMIC CHOICE<br>OF PUTTING OFF DECISIONS, AND DO NOT BUILD SHIPS ADEQUATE TO<br>FACE THE THREAT, OUR CHOICE WILL BE TO EITHER GIVE IN TO OUP<br>ENEMIES OR RESORT TO NUCLEAR WAR, THE COST OF ADEQUATE STRENGTH<br>TO ENSURE PEACE IS SMALL COMPARED TO THE COST OF WAR,</p>
<p>CURRENT ISSUES</p>
<p>I WOULD NOW LIKE TO COMMENT SPECIFICALLY ON SEVERAL CURRENT<br>ISSUES RELATED TO THE STRENGTH AND CAPABILITY OF OUR NAVAL FORCES,</p>
<p>1, JHE ATTACK SUBMARINE ISSUE</p>
<p>WHETHER WE SHOULD BUILD ENOUGH HIGHLY CAPABLE NUCLEAR POWERED<br>ATTACK SUBMARINES TO MEET THE NAVY&#x27;S MINIMUM NEEDS REMAINS<br>UNSETTLED,</p>
<p>AFTER A SERIES OF HEARINGS, THE SEAPOWER SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE<br>HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ISSUED A STRONG REPORT IN<br>DECEMBER 1979 RECOMMENDING AN INCREASED ATTACK SUBMARINE<br>BUILDING RATE TO KEEP THE FORCE LEVEL UP, AND RECOMMENDING<br>THAT THE NAVY PROCEED WITH BUILDING IMPROVED SSN6&amp;8 LOS ANGELES<br>CLASS SUBMARINES,</p>
<p>YET A MIXED ATTACK SUBMARINE FORCE OF SOME SLOWER AND SOME<br>FASTER UNITS CONTINUES TO BE STUDIED BY THE SYSTEMS ANALYSTS<br>AND WILL LIKELY BE STUDIED FOR YEARS TO COME. EVEN THOUGH<br>ALL THE STUDIES SHOW THAT THE FASTER, MORE CAPABLE SUBMARINES<br>ARE MORE COST EFFECTIVE OVER THEIR LIFETIME IN POSTULATED<br>&quot;OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS,” THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO<br>PRESS FOR BUILDING CHEAPER, LESS CAPABLE SUBMARINES TO SAVE<br>ON INITIAL COSTS,</p>
<p>THE ARGUMENTS FOR REDUCING COST BY BUILDING NEW, LESS CAPABLE<br>ATTACK SUBMARINES ARE SPECIOUS, WITH OUR LIMITED SUBMARINE<br>FORCE LEVEL, THE NORMAL PROCESS OF AGING WILL GIVE US A MIXED<br>FORCE, WITH SOME SUBMARINES BECOMING LESS CAPABLE AS THEY GET<br>OLDER, ALL OF THE SUBMARINE DESIGNERS AND OPERATORS STRONGLY<br>SUPPORT THE MORE CAPABLE ATTACK SUBMARINE, RECENT OPERATIONS<br>HAVE PROVIDED ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF THE SUPERIOR CAPABILITY OF<br>THE FASTER LOS ANGELES CLASS SUBMARINES, EVEN COMMANDERS IN<br>THE FLEET WHO ARE NOT SUBMARINERS RECOGNIZE THIS ADVANTAGE,</p>
<p>LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO REDUCE<br>THE SPEED OF A NEW ATTACK SUBMARINE BY 5 KNOTS BELOW THE<br>ATTAINABLE SPEED OF A LOS ANGELES CLASS SUBMARINE AS IS BEING<br>SUGGESTED:</p>
<p>o THE SLOWER U.S, SUBMARINES WOULD BE UNABLE TO KEEP<br>UP WITH AND ATTACK MOST SOVIET NUCLEAR ATTACK<br>SUBMARINES,</p>
<p>o THE SLOWER U.S, SUBMARINES WOULD BE UNABLE TO STAY<br>WITH AND ATTACK HIGH SPEED SURFACE SHIPS,</p>
<p>o THE SLOWER U.S, SUBMARINES WOULD BE UNABLE TO ESCORT<br>U.S, SURFACE SHIPS IN HIGH SPEED OPERATIONS,</p>
<p>o THE SLOWER U.S, SUBMARINES WOULD REQUIRE AN EXTRA<br>DAY AND A HALF TO TRANSIT THE ATLANTIC, IN A DAY</p>
<p>AND A HALF, A NUCLEAR ATTACK SUBMARINE COULD SEARCH<br>AN AREA THE SIZE OF NEW ENGLAND,</p>
<p>IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS EXERCISES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT NUCLEAR<br>ATTACK SUBMARINES ARE SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER ASW WEAPON SYSTEMS,<br>THE RAPID BUILDUP OF THE SOVIET SUBMARINE FLEET SHOWS THAT THE<br>NEED FOR ASW CAPABILITY IS INCREASING, I KNOW OF NO BREAKTHROUGHS<br>IN ASW TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE EFFECTIVELY COUNTERED THE SOVIET<br>SUBMARINE THREAT,</p>
<p>SOME SYSTEMS ANALYSTS ADVOCATE BUILDING LESS CAPABLE SUBMARINES<br>TO PERFORM LESS DEMANDING MISSIONS, THE FALLACY HERE IS THAT ME<br>CANNOT KNOW IN ADVANCE EXACTLY WHAT MISSION A GIVEN SUBMARINE<br>WILL BE CALLED UPON TO PERFORM IN A REAL WAR, UNLIKE OTHER<br>WEAPONS, THE ATTACK SUBMARINE FIGHTS ITS BATTLES ALONE AND</p>
<p>WITH LITTLE EXTERNAL SUPPORT, UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, LIMITED<br>MISSION SUBMARINES ARE NOT SUITED TO OUR NEEDS,</p>
<p>THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT POSTURE TO PRESS FOR SOME CHEAPER, LESS<br>CAPABLE SUBMARINES TO SAVE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS IS BEING<br>PUSHED BY THOSE IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY WHO DO NOT REALLY<br>UNDERSTAND SUBMARINE OPERATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN THOUGH THE<br>CURRENT MINIMUM FORCE LEVEL OF 90 ATTACK SUBMARINES IS LOWER THAN<br>DESIRED, THE SUBMARINE OPERATORS HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD PREFER<br>FEWER, MORE CAPABLE ATTACK SUBMARINES IF THAT IS WHAT IT MOULD<br>TAKE TO GET THE BEST ONES, BUILDING FEWER SUBMARINES IS NOT THE<br>ANSWER BUT THIS ATTITUDE SHOWS HOW STRONGLY THOSE WHO REALLY<br>UNDERSTAND SUBMARINES FEEL,</p>
<p>THIS MATTER WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE TO BE SETTLED BY CONGRESS,</p>
<p>THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY TAKEN POSITIVE ACTION IN THE FY81 DEFENSE<br>AUTHORIZATION BILL TO RECOMMEND THREE SSN688 CLASS ATTACK<br>SUBMARINES. IT ALSO DELETED ALL LONG LEAD FUNDS FOR A SLOWER,<br>LESS CAPABLE ATTACK SUBMARINE, AND INCLUDED ADVANCE FUNDS FOR<br>AN IMPROVED SSN688 CLASS SUBMARINE DESIGN, CONTINUED STRONG<br>SUPPORT BY CONGRESS WILL BE NEEDED TO ASSURE THAT THIS ACTION<br>IS SUSTAINED,</p>
<p>2, IRIDENT</p>
<p>TURNING NOW TO THE BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINES, THE FY81<br>SHIPBUILDING PROGRAM INCLUDES FUNDS FOR THE NINTH TRIDENT<br>SUBMARINE, THESE SUBMARINES WILL HAVE INCREASED SURVIVABILITY<br>COMPARED TO OUR EXISTING POLARIS AND POSEIDON SUBMARINES BECAUSE<br>THEY ARE BEING BUILT WITH ALL THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY, THEY WILL<br>BE MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT THAN EXISTING POLARIS AND POSEIDON<br>SUBMARINES BECAUSE THEY WILL BE QUIETER. AND THEIR LONGER</p>
<p>RANGE MISSILES WILL GIVE THEM 10 TO 20 TIMES MORE OCEAN AREA</p>
<p>IN WHICH TO HIDE. OUR EXISTING POLARIS AND POSEIDON SUBMARINES<br>ARE NOISY COMPARED TO PRESENT STANDARDS. THEY WERE ALL BUILT<br>WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE 1950&#x27;s, QUIETER SUBMARINES ARE<br>NECESSARY TO DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF DETECTION AND T9<br>ENSURE SURVIVABILITY OF OUR SEABORNE STRATEGIC DETERRENT,</p>
<p>THE LONGER RANGE OF THE TRIDENT MISSILES WILL PERMIT BASING<br>OUR BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINES IN THE U.S, -- NO FOREIGN<br>BASING WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS WILL ELIMINATE THE VULNERABILITY</p>
<p>OF OUR BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE FORCE TO INTERNATIONAL<br>POLITICAL ACTION THAT COULD DENY US USE OF FOREIGN BASES,<br>THIS IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS IN DANGER OF LOSING<br>OUR FOREIGN BASES.</p>
<p>I CONSIDER THE TRIDENT PROGRAM VITAL TO OUR NATIONAL SURVIVAL.<br>CONTINUED CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT WILL BE NEEDED.</p>
<p>3, NEED FOR NUCLEAR POWERED AEGIS CRUISERS</p>
<p>FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, NAVY WITNESSES HAVE TESTIFIED THAT<br>THE AEGIS SYSTEM IS NEEDED TO PROTECT OUR SURFACE SHIPS AGAINST<br>THE PROJECTED SOVIET AIR THREAT IN THE 1980&#x27;s, THESE SHIPS WOULD<br>BE KEY ELEMENTS IN PROVIDING SOPHISTICATED AIR DEFENSE FOR OUR<br>AIRCRAFT CARRIER STRIKE FORCES AGAINST ENEMY MISSILES, PRESENT<br>NAVY PLANS ARE TO BUILD A NUMBER OF OIL FIRED, GAS TURBINE POWERED<br>AEGIS FLEET AIR DEFENSE SHIPS, THE CG 47 CLASS,</p>
<p>I CONSIDER THAT AEGIS SHIPS SHOULD BE NUCLEAR POWERED FOR THE<br>SAME REASONS THAT AIRCRAFT CARRIERS NEED TO BE NUCLEAR POWERED --<br>REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY DEMONSTRATED RECENTLY IN</p>
<p>THE INDIAN OCEAN, THE AEGIS IS PLANNED AS OUR MOST CAPABLE<br>ANTI-ATR WARFARE WEAPONS SYSTEM, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE EXPENSIVE,<br>REGARDLESS OF THEIR MEANS OF PROPULSION, THERE WILL NEVER BE</p>
<p>A LARGE NUMBER, IN A NAVAL WAR AGAINST AN ENEMY EMPLOYING<br>SOPHISTICATED WEAPON SYSTEMS, AEGIS SHIPS WILL BE NEEDED IN THE<br>AREAS OF HIGHEST THREAT. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE ADVANTAGES<br>OF NUCLEAR PROPULSION ARE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED FOR MAXIMUM<br>MOBILITY AND MINIMUM LOGISTIC SUPPORT. THE NUCLEAR POWERED</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>CARRIERS WILL BE EMPLOYED IN HIGH THREAT AREAS AND THEY WILL NEED<br>NUCLEAR POWERED AEGIS SHIPS TO ACCOMPANY THEM,</p>
<p>IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT TANKERS CAN SURVIVE IN AREAS WHERE<br>THE THREAT IS GREAT ENOUGH TO REQUIRE FIRST LINE NAVAL STRIKE<br>FORCES. WHEN A NON-NUCLEAR AEGIS SHIP RUNS LOW ON FUEL, IT<br>WILL HAVE TO RETREAT TO AN AREA OF LOWER THREAT TO MEET A<br>TANKER, LOSING THE AEGIS SYSTEM&#x27;S PROTECTION JUST &quot;HEN IT IS<br>MOST NEEDED. UNLESS NUCLEAR POWERED AEGIS CRUISERS ARE BUILT,<br>OUR NUCLEAR CARRIERS WILL HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY CCNVENTIONALLY<br>POWERED AEGIS SHIPS WHEN THEY ENTER THE HIGHEST THREAT AREAS,<br>THIS WOULD CONSTRAIN THE TASK GROUP TO THE LOGISTICS LIMITATIONS<br>OF THE OIL FIRED, GAS TURBINE POWERED CRUISERS, THUS SACRIFICING<br>THE SIGNIFICANT MILITARY ADVANTAGES OF THE ALL-NUCLEAR CARRIER<br>TASK FORCE IN THE VERY AREAS WHERE THESE ADVANTAGES ARE MOST<br>NEEDED,</p>
<p>LIFE CYCLE COST COMPARISONS OF NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL WARSHIPS<br>COMPARE PEACETIME COSTS, AND ASSUME THAT CARRIER TASK FORCES CAN<br>BE SAFELY REPLENISHED WHEREVER THEY MAY BE. IF THE COST OF<br>PROVIDING THE CARRIER TASK FORCES WITH THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT<br>REPLENISHMENT OPERATIONS IN AREAS SUBJECT TO THE SOVIET NAVAL<br>THREAT OF THE 1989’s WERE USED, THE OVERALL COST OF NUCLEAR<br>POWERED SURFACE WARSHIPS WOULD BE SHOWN TO BE LESS THAN THAT</p>
<p>OF NON-NUCLEAR SHIPS,</p>
<p>IN THE 1980’s AND BEYOND, IN ANY AREAS WHERE THE SOVIETS CHALLENGE<br>US, WE WILL NEED ALL-NUCLEAR CARRIER TASK FORCES TO BE ABLE TO</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>KEEP OUR SEA LANES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN, AIRCRAFT CARRIERS<br>AND AEGIS FLEET AIR DEFENSE SHIPS WILL BE THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS<br>OF THESE NAVAL STRIKE FORCES WHICH MUST BE CAPABLE OF FIGHTING<br>IN AREAS OF HIGHEST THREAT, CONSIDERING THE DIFFICULTIES OF<br>PROVIDING LOGISTIC SUPPORT IN SUCH AREAS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT<br>OUR AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND AEGIS WARSHIPS BE GIVEN THE MOBILITY<br>AND FLEXIBILITY THAT ONLY NUCLEAR PROPULSION CAN PROVIDE,</p>
<p>4, RETENTION OF EXPERIENCED NAVAL PERSONNEL |<br>I WANT TO MENTION ONE OTHER IMPORTANT CURRENT PROBLEM WITH</p>
<p>RESPECT TO OUR DEFENSE READINESS, YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE</p>
<p>LACK OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN OUR ARMED FORCES. WE CANNOT</p>
<p>SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY JUST BRINGING IN MORE NEW PEOPLE, WE</p>
<p>MUST RETAIN MORE MEN AFTER THEIR FIRST AND SECOND TOURS,</p>
<p>RETENTION OF EXPERIENCED, NUCLEAR-TRAINED OFFICERS AND MEN</p>
<p>IS THE MOST CRITICAL PROBLEM FACING THE NUCLEAR NAVY AS</p>
<p>WELL AS THE REST OF THE NAVY, THE PROBLEM IS SO ACUTE WE MAY</p>
<p>HAVE TO TIE UP SOME OF OUR NUCLEAR POWERED SHIPS FOR LACK OF</p>
<p>TRAINED, EXPERIENCED PEOPLE. CIVILIAN INDUSTRY IS LURING</p>
<p>THESE PEOPLE AWAY AT A HIGH RATE,</p>
<p>THE KEY TO IMPROVED RETENTION WITH OUR ALL -VOLUNTEER MILITARY<br>IS ADEQUATE PAY AND BENEFITS, THE NAVY CAN NEVER COMPETE<br>EQUALLY WITH CIVILIAN INDUSTRY, BUT THE PAY GAP CAN BE CLOSED<br>SO WE CAN RETAIN HIGHLY QUALIFIED MEN IN WHOM THE NAVY HAS SO<br>LARGE A TRAINING INVESTMENT,</p>
<p>PASSAGE OF THE NUNN-WARNER LEGISLATION ALREADY PASSED BY THE<br>SENATE WILL BE ONE STEP, THE OVERALL FY81 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION<br>BILL BEING CONSIDERED CONTAINS MORE IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP RETAIN<br>SKILLED PEOPLE. STRONG SUPPORT BY THE CONGRESS IS NEEDED FOR<br>THESE MEASURES,</p>
<p>CLOSING COMMENTS</p>
<p>I HAVE SHARED WITH YOU MY THOUGHTS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT<br>OF BEING INVOLVED IN OUR NATION’S DEFENSE FOR A LONG TIME AND<br>IN CHARGE OF THE NUCLEAR PROPULSION PROGRAM SINCE ITS INCEPTION<br>OVER 25 YEARS AGO, FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, I AM PARTICULARLY<br>SENSITIVE TO THE ROLE THAT THE CONGRESS HAS PLAYED, WITHOUT<br>REPEATED CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS AND HELP THROUGHOUT THE YEARS,<br>WE SIMPLY WOULD NOT, TODAY, HAVE THE STRONG NUCLEAR FLEET WE<br>HAVE, NOW REPRESENTING OVER 49% OF THE NAVY&#x27;S MAJOR COMBATANTS,<br>YOU HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN THIS<br>NATION&#x27;S ABILITY TO DEFEND ITSELF, INDEED NO OTHER NATIONAL<br>ISSUE IS MORE CRITICAL THAN NATIONAL DEFENSE, IF WE ARE NOT<br>ABLE TO PREVAIL AGAINST OUR ENEMIES, ALL OTHER ISSUES, HOWEVER<br>SIGNIFICANT, BECOME IRRELEVANT, IT IS TO THE CONGRESS THAT WE<br>ALL MUST LOOK FOR A DEFENSE POSTURE STRONG ENOUGH TO ASSURE OUR<br>SURVIVAL AS A NATION,</p>
