      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document presents Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s October 9, 1959, acceptance speech for the National League of Masonic Clubs&#x27; Meritorious Service Medal, where he transitions from discussing his celebrated contributions as the &quot;father of the atomic submarine&quot; to passionately addressing the critical state of American education. Rickover expresses deep concern, citing his dismay with the &quot;inferior product&quot; of the US educational system and drawing stark comparisons with the rigorous Soviet model. He presents alarming statistics, including that Russia graduated 40% more scientists and engineers than the US in the previous year, was projected to graduate 200,000 by 1961 (compared to America&#x27;s 130,000), and boasted a larger total STEM workforce in 1957. Rickover links Russia&#x27;s impressive economic growth (9.5% annually vs. US&#x27;s 4%) directly to their demanding 10-month, 6-day-a-week school system, which emphasizes subject mastery and requires knowledge equivalent to two years of US college for high school graduates. He critiques the American system&#x27;s shorter school year (180 days versus Europe&#x27;s 240-280), 10% functional illiteracy rate, and the influence of &quot;professional educators&quot; who prioritize &quot;life-adjustment&quot; over academic subjects, advocating for national educational standards and warning that &quot;any nation that neglects education has already joined the ranks of the defeated.&quot; The speech also references his related works, &quot;Report on Russia&quot; and &quot;Education and Freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>RICKOVER AND EDUCATION</p>
<p>An address delivered by one of our countries most outstanding scientists<br>before a capacity audience of over 700 Square Club Masons, their wives and<br>friends who were attending the 53rd Annual Convention and National President&#x27;s<br>Banquet at the Hotel Astor, Friday evening, October 9, 1959, is recorded here<br>for your reading pleasure.</p>
<p>Past National President, Bro. Joseph Montgomery, who presented the<br>Meritorious Award said: As you all know the National League of Masonic Clubs<br>awards its Meritorious Service Medal to some individual who has rendered an<br>outstanding meritorious service. |</p>
<p>This year it was unanimously decided by the members of the League to award<br>the Medal to Vice Admiral Rickover, who is best known to all of you as the<br>father of the atomic submarine.</p>
<p>While he is best known throughout the world for the development of the<br>atomic submarine he has many other accomplishments to his eredit and he has<br>rendered many outstanding meritorious services which perhaps are not so well<br>known.</p>
<p>For those outstanding services and accomplishments he has received many</p>
<p>awards and recognitions. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his outstanding</p>
<p>services during World War IIs the citation accompanying that award reads in<br>part as follows:<br>&quot;Working with foresight and ability, he brought about continual improve-</p>
<p>ments in electrical equipment to meet the developing and expanding needs of</p>
<p>modern Naval warfare, thereby contributing to the increased military effectiveness</p>
<p>of the vessels of the fleet and to the successful prosecution of the war.</p>
<p>For his service on the staff of the Commander of the Service Force of</p>
<p>the United States Pacific Fleet, and as the Commanding Officer of Naval Repair<br>Base in Okinawa, he received a letter of commendation from Commander-in-Chief<br>of the U. S. Pacific Fleet, with authorization to wear the commendation ribbon.</p>
<p>For his outstanding service in connection with the development of the atomic<br>bomb, he later received a letter of commendation from the War Department with<br>the authorization to wear the Oak Leaf Cluster on his commendation ribbon.</p>
<p>He received the Gold Star in lieu of his second Legion of Merit for<br>exceptional and meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services<br>to the Government of the United States as Chief of Naval Reactors Branch of the<br>Atomic Energy Commission and as Director of the Nuclear Power Division of the<br>Navy Bureau of Ships.</p>
<p>The lengthy citation that accompanies that decoration concludes with<br>these words:</p>
<p>t...His careful and accurate planning, his technical knowledge and his<br>ability..shave proven a contribution of inestimable value to the country&#x27;s<br>security and reflect great credit upon him and the United States Naval Service.&quot;</p>
<p>He received a special Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his<br>‘signal achievement in the practical uses of Atomic Energy. He was responsible<br>for the building of the Shippingport, Pennsylvania Atomic Power Station, the<br>first full scale plant for the development of peaceful atomic power in this<br>country.</p>
<p>His accomplishments and decorations are so many that to even mention them<br>would take more time than I have granted, but I am certain with those which I<br>have mentioned you will agree that the League has made a wise choice for its</p>
<p>1959 Medal Award. .<br>2</p>
<p>You will probably recall that Admiral Rickover was one of the technical</p>
<p>assistants who accompanied Vice President Nixon on his trip to Russia.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve also probably read in the press about his appearance before the<br>Congressional Appropriations Committee. I have before me a copy of the<br>hearings of that committee, and this is what the Chairman of the committee<br>said in the opening of the hearing:</p>
<p>We are honored by having with us today one of the most distinguished men<br>of the nation, the &#x27;Father of Nuclear Propulsion.&#x27; The nation would not be<br>safe today--if it is safe--except for the contribution of Admiral Rickover in<br>the adaptation of nuclear power to submarines and the utilization of atomic<br>energy in both military and civilian enterprises.&quot;</p>
<p>I might say that this booklet as it affects us today--you may not have<br>heard about it, I&#x27;m going to tell you how you can get a copy, because if you<br>want to know more about Admiral Rickover, more about the Russian situation,<br>more about his ideas on education, you can get this free pamphlet, entitled<br>&quot;Report on Russia by Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, USN,&quot; by writing to the<br>Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Washington 25, D. C.<br>It&#x27;s in question and answer form, the questions are asked by the members of<br>the Appropriations Committee and Admiral Rickover gives the varied appropriate<br>answers, and I know that you will all enjoy reading this book.</p>
<p>With these few remarks, I believe that I have sufficiently introduced to<br>you our Medal Award Winner. So, therefore, Admiral Rickover, it is an honor<br>for me, on behalf of the National League of Masonic Clubs, to have this privilege<br>of presenting you with this Meritorious Service Award, for 1959, and with this<br>citation which reads as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The National League of Masonic Clubs, in recognition of the meritorious</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>and faithful service and devotion to our country as evidenced by his pioneering<br>in the field of nuclear power development; his leadership, foresight and<br>engineering skill which contributed to the technological expansion of modern<br>naval warfare and the increased effectiveness of our Naval Fleet, and his<br>display of exceptional outstanding talents resulting in the rapid development<br>of nuclear powered suhailivna , as well as peace-time atomic power stations, The<br>National League of Masonic Clubs in convention assembled in New York, N. Y.,<br>has awarded its ninth Meritorious Service Medal to Hyman George Rickover, Vice<br>Admiral of the United States Navy,™® signed by our National President, attested<br>to by our National Secretary.</p>
<p>(Applause. )</p>
<p>‘We - (-eeetere:.  -.</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests, ladies and<br>gentlemen.</p>
<p>I can accept this great honor which you have conferred upon me only in<br>the name of all the men and women who work with me, in my own organization,<br>in the Atomic Energy Commission laboratories and in the many factories that<br>design, develop, and produce nuclear components.</p>
<p>Credit belongs also to the men in the shipyards and construction organiza-<br>tions, and to many, many others, particularly members of Congress, who have<br>helped our nuclear program. The success of our projects is due in large measure<br>to these people. In rewarding me, you are simply telling me that I am fortunate<br>enough to be the leader of such a fine group. Any credit due really belongs<br>to them.</p>
<p>One thing the Toastmaster touched on is dearer to my heart than atomic<br>energy. That is education. Tonight I am going to take advantage of this<br>captive audience to say a few words about this &quot;extracurricular&quot; activity of<br>mine.</p>
<p>I became interested in education about 10 years ago when I started to<br>develop atomic power plants for the Navy. It soon became obvious to me that<br>many of the men in my organization were not able to do a good job. These men,<br>some of the best our schools could offer, had to be trained for two to three<br>years before they were of any use to us. As a consumer of our educational<br>system, I found I was getting an inferior product.</p>
<p>Around 1954, several years before the &quot;Sputnik,&quot; I began to familiarize<br>myself with what the Russians were doing in education. What I saw frightened</p>
<p>me, and I began making speeches about education at that time. I then felt that</p>
<p>the problem could be solved simply by raising teachers&#x27; salaries to attract<br>better people into the profession.</p>
<p>About two or three years ago, I began to see that salaries were not the<br>only or even the major problem. The basic fault with our educational system<br>lies in the degrading of teacher training in the United States over the past<br>century and a half. I started finding out why this had occurred, and in the<br>last few years I have devoted a considerable amount of time to this problem.</p>
<p>I think it is appropriate that I talk about education here for a short<br>time. The Masonic Order has brotherhood as one of its two main precepts and,<br>as you all know, you cannot absorb the knowledge of how to be a true brother<br>unless you are truly educated. .</p>
<p>True brotherhood is perhaps the only way to end the constant threat of |<br>war which the human race has faced for thousands of years. In order to under-<br>stand the concept of brotherhood, people must become educated; their minds<br>must be developed so that they can acquire a capacity to think beyond their<br>own small personal world.</p>
<p>I find it particularly difficult to talk on these abstruse matters after<br>so many fine speeches, but I will give you some brief statistics:</p>
<p>For the past seven years, the Russians have been graduating more scientists<br>and engineers than we have. Last year, for example, they graduated 40 per cent<br>more than our country. By 1961, they will be graduating 200,000, or about</p>
<p>70,000 more than America. The picture is even grimmer than these numbers</p>
<p>indicate because, since 1957, the Russians have topped us in total number.<br>In 1957, they had about 1,500,000 and we had 1,330,000. But this doesn&#x27;t</p>
<p>tell the whole story. Of their 1, 500,000, a very high percentage were doing</p>
<p>scientific and engineering work, while in this country many of our people<br>go into administrative and other non-technical jobs soon after leaving college.</p>
<p>In addition, their scientists and engineers are, to a considerable extent,<br>better educated than ours. A far larger percentage have advanced degrees such<br>as Doctor of Philosophy.</p>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that in 1961, Russia will have<br>about 25 per cent more scientists and engineers than we.</p>
<p>Now, what do these figures really mean? Does it actually make much<br>difference if somebody else has more scientists and engineers than we? Well,<br>people might say, “If we had more, we&#x27;d be stronger and there would be less<br>chance for war.&quot;</p>
<p>It is certainly true that one of the surest ways to maintain peace is to<br>remain militarily strong. But there are two other reasons why our lag in educa-<br>tion should concern us. One reason is that quite apart from Russia&#x27;s military<br>threat, we must not lose sight of the struggle on the economic front. Even<br>if a fighting war were no longer a possibility, there would still be an economic<br>cold war that might last for generations. Don&#x27;t forget that the Russians are<br>determined to beat us in everything. They have surpassed us in education and<br>in some military developments and as Khrushchev has made quite elear, they are<br>going all-out to surpass us in industrialization. Some people feel this will<br>never happen; I am more pessimistic and feel we will maintain our lead for at<br>least 15 or 20 years.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that their economy is growing at the rate of about 93 per cent<br>a year for the past 10 years compared to an average of about 4 per cent in<br>America. It is these rate of growth figures which are significant--not so</p>
<p>much the actual status at this time.</p>
<p>Now all this industrialization would not have been possible without educated</p>
<p>people. The recent products of Soviet industry are nothing more than the<br>fruitful results of years of government sponsored research and training. Their<br>newer factories are quite as impressive as our own widely-acclaimed production<br>lines.</p>
<p>If we are to maintain our current superiority in industrialization, it is<br>evident that our educational system must be improved.</p>
<p>The second reason why we should be concerned with our educational deficiencies<br>is that education is a good thing in itself. It is good for the individual and<br>good for the country.</p>
<p>The importance of education was recognized as far back as 500 B.C. when<br>Aristotle said that &quot;the primary obligation of any legislature is the education<br>and the training of its youth.&quot; This is the quotation I am constantly repeating<br>to Congressional Committees. Any nation that neglects education has already<br>“joined the ranks of the defeated.</p>
<p>This is why I urge all of you to do everything you can to help improve our<br>schools.</p>
<p>If you want to see for yourselves just how wide a gap exists between the<br>educational level of the Russian student and his American counterpart, Mr.<br>Montgomery mentioned a little booklet that includes a complete set of examina-<br>tions which 17 year old Russian children have to pass when they finish high</p>
<p>school. The amount of knowledge required to pass these examinations will rarely be -</p>
<p>possessed by American youth unless they have had two years of college. I suggest you |</p>
<p>give these examinations to your own children and show them to your teachers</p>
<p>and school boards. Don&#x27;t let them give you the usual prattle that you can&#x27;t<br>compare a democratic with a totalitarian system. The exams cover algebra,<br>chemistry, physics, languages, etc. These subjects have nothing to do with<br>ideology.</p>
<p>I would like to make one more point on our school system. American<br>educators are always lauding the &quot;democracy® of our educational system. Only<br>yesterday I received a newspaper clipping from a New Mexico newspaper. Later<br>this month I am making a speech there and it happens that the educators of<br>that state are meeting on the same day; they have protested to the newspapers<br>and to the Chamber of Commerce that my presence at that time is unfair.</p>
<p>Now, this is a fine example of living &quot;democracy.&quot; The horrible thing<br>about this is that these educators don&#x27;t really recognize what they are doing.<br>In spite of all their talk about democracy, they don&#x27;t even know what the word<br>means.</p>
<p>I hope you didn&#x27;t mind sitting through these rather serious remarks of<br>mine, but as you can see, the matter of education is of deep concern to me.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that you can do nothing more to demonstrate your love of<br>our country and our children than by doing all you can to bring our educational<br>system back to what it should be. |</p>
<p>(Applause )</p>
<p>_ BROTHER LORD: ‘The Admiral has consented that if anyone has a question to<br>ask him on education, he will answer it.</p>
<p>A VOICE: Admiral Rickover, can you tell me is it true that all students<br>in Russia have free tuition and are wined and dined and given all accessories</p>
<p>on the cuff; is that so?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Well, they don&#x27;t wear cuffs and “they don&#x27;t get wined,<br>put outside of that, what you said is true. Perhaps I could elaborate a little<br>bit on that.</p>
<p>Their basic school system, except in small country towns, is a 10-year system.<br>This is a system comparable to that in use in Western Europe for more than a<br>century. In small towns, Russian students normally have only seven years of<br>schooling, but even these students know more than most of ours do when they<br>graduate from high school.</p>
<p>All tuition is free in Russia; university students are actually given<br>expense money, roughly as much as a skilled worker gets.</p>
<p>I visited some of these Russian schools and talked with Mr. Khrushchev<br>about education, so I am talking firsthand.</p>
<p>A VOICE: May I follow it up with a question? Are they obligated to<br>stay until they graduate?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: No, they aren&#x27;t actually forced to graduate. But every<br>Russian student knows that if he fails at school, there will be nothing but a<br>drab life of hard labor ahead. (i the other hand, a university graduate is &quot;fixed&quot;<br>for life. This acts as a powerful incentive and explains why Russian students<br>study so hard.</p>
<p>A VOICE: Can you tell me if the Russians have any different teaching<br>methods than we have?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Perhaps the most important difference between Russian</p>
<p>teaching and our own is that Russian teachers are expected to know the subject</p>
<p>_ they are teaching-—they are not as concerned with teaching method.</p>
<p>In Russia, or in any other European nation, you would certainly not find</p>
<p>secondary school students taught by teachers who have spent almost all their<br>10</p>
<p>time absorbing the technique of teaching and a bare minimum devoted to the</p>
<p>actual subject they are teaching. This is exactly the situation that prevails<br>in our own public schools.</p>
<p>One reason why the Russians don&#x27;t have to put Up with this sort of a<br>situation is that they have nothing corresponding to our propaganda organizations ,<br>such as the National Education Association, admittedly a lobbying organization<br>that. effectively controls our school systems and goes to great pains to prevent<br>criticism from within and without. I have received many letters from teachers—--<br>some who don&#x27;t dare sign their names-—-who are disgusted with the stranglehold<br>professional educationists have over our schools but who are afraid to criticize<br>for fear of what will happen to them.</p>
<p>BROTHER SCHOONMAKER: Admiral Rickover, can you answer something that has<br>been bothering me? |</p>
<p>In our public school system, we have 10 days off at Christmas and a week<br>off at Easter and three months off in the summer. Hours from 9~-3:30, we have<br>the afternoons off to watch a football team, and when the teachers have a con=-<br>vention, they close the school for three days in my home town.</p>
<p>Do they do anything like that in Russia?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Russian students go to school 10 months a year, six<br>hours a day, six days a week. As a matter of fact, the Russians spend somewhat ~<br>fewer hours at school than most other Europeans.</p>
<p>The average number of school days in Europe is around 240 days. Denmark<br>has a school year of 280 days as compared with 180 in America. Danish children<br>go to school six hours a day, six days a week and have three to four hours of</p>
<p>home work a night.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Some American educators claim that this would be dangerous to the children&#x27;s</p>
<p>health--that they would be overworked. But don&#x27;t forget the Armed Services of<br>the United States have the greatest percentage of physical misfits of any<br>country in the world.</p>
<p>Before you can make our children go to school as long as they do in Europe,<br>you have to get their parents behind the idea. You can&#x27;t preach one thing for<br>the children and do another yourself. How can a parent who wants to go ona<br>vacation one month a year and work four or five days a week expect his children<br>to go to work six hours a day at school and study another four at home, six<br>days a week, 280 days a year. That would obviously interfere with the family<br>vacation.</p>
<p>(Applause )</p>
<p>BROTHER HICINBOTHAM: Can you tell us, Admiral, if there are any private<br>schools in Russia or are there any schools under the control of the Government?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: The only private schools are the graveyards.</p>
<p>(Applause and laughter)</p>
<p>A VOICE: Admiral Rickover, do they promote everybody in the institution<br>of higher learning whether they deserve it or not?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: No, they give tough examinations such as the one I<br>spoke about earlier. About 30 per cent of their high school graduates go on<br>to a university. This is quite an improvement because until 50 or 100 years<br>ago only about four or five per cent were educated at all. That was all that<br>was necessary to maintain an agricultural society.</p>
<p>The only way for advancement in Russia is through education. The Russians</p>
<p>send their best people to school while we in the United States let many of our</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>top students go right to work after high school—either because they can&#x27;t</p>
<p>afford to go to college or because they don&#x27;t consider a college education<br>very important. The American student knows he can make a good living without<br>a college degree—-the Russian student knows he cannot.</p>
<p>A VOICE: Are the other systems of education in Western Europe comparable<br>to the Russian system?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: The Russian school system is not nearly as hard or<br>thorough as others in Western Europe.</p>
<p>A 15 year old in Holland and Switzerland could pass examinations that a<br>17 year old Russian student does or that a 20 or 21 year old could in the<br>United States.</p>
<p>A VOICE: I have one more question.</p>
<p>Are the colleges of Western Europe, do they all have free tuition for<br>their students?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: In most European countries they are free, or practically<br>so. In Holland, for example, the maximum one has to pay for going to the<br>university is around $75 a year.</p>
<p>This is something we don&#x27;t generally understand. We all think that free<br>elementary education started in the United States. It did not. In fact there<br>was free elementary education in Germany after the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>The reason at that time was that under Catholicism, nobody except a Priest had<br>been allowed to read the Bible. Iuther and his followers wanted to spread the<br>words of the Bible among the people. Consequently schools ware started to<br>permit all the people to learn how to read and write their own language.</p>
<p>There was compulsory elementary education in parts of Prussia in 1717</p>
<p>13 . |</p>
<p>and free education by 1794. By 1882, many European countries had compulsory</p>
<p>elementary education. \</p>
<p>Apart from scattered pre-Revolutionary efforts to make education compulsory,<br>we had the first compulsory education law in Massachusetts in 1852 and this<br>required only 12 weeks of schooling per year and only for ages 8 to ly. By 1889,<br>some 25 states had some form of compulsory education but it was effective only<br>in two--Massachusetts and Connecticut. The last compulsory attendance law was<br>enacted by Mississippi in 1920.</p>
<p>Our sluggishness in education shows up in the fact that we still have 10</p>
<p>per cent functional illiterates--individuals who cannot really understand what</p>
<p>they read. In Germany they stopped giving literacy tests more than 50 years<br>ago because only a small fraction of one per cent couldn&#x27;t read and write.</p>
<p>The Communists, in spite of all their bad qualities, could recognize a<br>good thing when they saw it. After some fruitless experiments with the |<br>progressive and permissive educational system of Dewey, they quickly saw the<br>harm it was doing and remodeled their schools after those of Western Europe.<br>They still haven&#x27;t caught up——but we don&#x27;t even try.</p>
<p>A VOICE: Admiral Rickover, is the educational problem that confronts us<br>one that could be treated locally or is it one that must be treated nationally<br>to uniformly raise the educational standard throughout the nation and what<br>can we do about it?</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: Well, in every country that has had any success with<br>improvement of its school system, they have had to set up a standard. Now, we<br>have some 57,000 individual school boards in the United States--I doubt that</p>
<p>all of them could agree on a single standard. I feel a national standard</p>
<p>Wy</p>
<p>would be the best. State standards would do some good too.</p>
<p>With a national standard, each community could judge for itself just how<br>well its schools were training their children. Right now, it is difficult<br>for a parent to fight through the layers of educational bureaucracy and find<br>the truth about his child&#x27;s school.</p>
<p>We have nothing comparable to the nation wide examinations. You can bet<br>that if the students from a particular school were doing poorly on one of<br>these examinations the parents and the commnity would kick up such a fuss<br>that the situation would be immediately remedied. |</p>
<p>Though this would involve a federal standard that is not obligatory, many<br>people see in it federal control and reject it for this reason. We like the<br>idea in America of having each commnity control its own schools. But don&#x27;t<br>forget that in most states, the local board is legally considered an agency<br>of the state and not an independent organ. Moreover, in actual practice board<br>members rarely have the power to exert as much influence on curricula and teacher<br>qualification as the so-called &quot;professional educators&quot;=——that is, the men who<br>administer public education and teach in departments of education and teachers<br>colleges. These &quot;professional educators&quot; have set up a &quot;closed shop&quot; for teachers,<br>and often insist that each student take a heavy dose of &quot;life-adjustment&quot;<br>subjects. Little is said about the academic subjects.</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to say that there is no greater duty you can do<br>for our country than to help improve our schools.</p>
<p>I have devoted almost every spare minute of my private life to the problem<br>for the past 10 years. Perhaps I can convey some of my concern to you. I hope</p>
<p>you won&#x27;t dispose of the problem by saying &quot;He made a nice speech.™</p>
<p>I would be pained and hurt if I thought that this well-to-do audience had<br>no desire to provide a decent education for their children. God knows none of<br>us would be as well off anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>I am merely trying to repay in some slight amount what this country has<br>done for me. I hope I can convey that same feeling of gratitude and urgency<br>to you. If I have succeeded in doing that for some of you, my coming here<br>will have been well worthwhile. Thank you.</p>
<p>(Applause) .</p>
<p>CONVENTION CHAIRMAN LORD: Again, Admiral Rickover, may I thank you for</p>
<p>your interesting and educational treat. This has never happened to us before,</p>
<p>that our guest of honor has asked this large audience “Are there any questions?</p>
<p>and answered them so simply and plainly.</p>
<p>I believe you would also be interested in a book written by Admiral<br>Rickover, &quot;Education and Freedom,&quot; published by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc.,<br>New York. It contains his views on our education problem and other related<br>matters.</p>
<p>We have now come to the conclusion of the ceremonies and we--may I again<br>thank our distinguished guest for being with us.</p>
<p>We are the ones that are honored.</p>
<p>(Applause. )</p>
