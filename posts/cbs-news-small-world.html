      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This transcript from the November 2, 1958, &quot;Small World&quot; broadcast captures a lively discussion on American education, moderated by Edward R. Murrow and featuring Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, Professor Mark Van Doren, and author Rebecca West. The central theme explores the perceived inadequacy of U.S. education, particularly in comparison to other nations like Russia post-Sputnik, and the public&#x27;s reluctance to acknowledge these issues. Rickover passionately argues for a more rigorous, nationally driven system that prioritizes developing intellectual talent, contrasting it with what he sees as an overemphasis on &quot;fun&quot; and local control. Van Doren largely agrees on the need for improvement but voices caution against early academic segregation, emphasizing the historical breadth of liberal education. Rebecca West provides a cultural critique, suggesting Americans&#x27; ingrained optimism prevents them from confronting educational deficiencies and drawing parallels with Europe&#x27;s historical experience of hardship fostering a more realistic outlook. The conversation also touches on politicians&#x27; role in addressing difficult truths and the importance of recognizing intellectual development as a national &quot;gold reserve.&quot;</p>

<p>of quality products for you and industry in many fields,<br>COMMERCIAL</p>
<p>EDWARD R, MURROW:<br>Good evening. Tonight on SMALL WORLD a novelist from Buckinghamshire, a poet<br>from Cornwall, Connecticut, and an 4dmiral from Annapolis. From London,<br>Britain&#x27;s illustrious lady of letters, Rebecca West, who writes about Yugo-<br>slavia (BLACK LAMB AND GREY FALCON) , American race problems (A TRAIN OF<br>POWDER), and Hamlet&#x27;s psyche (THE COURT AND THE CASTLE). Good evening, Miss</p>
<p>West.</p>
<p>REBECCA WEST:</p>
<p>Good evening, Ed.</p>
<p>MURROW: |<br>Rebecca, I&#x27;d like you to meet Rear Admiral, correction, Vice Admiral Hyman<br>Rickover of the United States Navy. Occupation - the building of atomic<br>submarines, nuclear power plants, and pamphleteering in the name of better</p>
<p>education, The Admiral is in his office in Washington,</p>
<p>ge</p>
<p>VICE ADMIRAL HYMAN RICKOVER;:</p>
<p>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever talked to a poet over long distance,</p>
<p>PROFESSOR MARK VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>Oh - really? Well, it&#x27;s just the same,</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>Admiral, meet one of America&#x27;s great teachers - Professor Mark Van Doren of<br>Columbia University, whose recent biography is the eloquently simple record<br>of a poet, historian, philosopher, and man, Professor Van Doren is in his</p>
<p>study in Cornwall, Connecticut.<br>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>Well, I am very happy to meet them both. I met Miss West many years ago,</p>
<p>very briefly, but I have never mo¢ the Admiral,</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>We&#x27;re on the eve of an election in this country, as you know, and yet strangely<br>enough, not very much is being said in the course of this political campaign<br>about one of the major problems confronting this country, namely education.<br>There seems to be considerable political indtfference to the whole subject of</p>
<p>education. Would you say that&#x27;s right, Admiral?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I think it&#x27;s because we in the United States consider education to be a local<br>problem and not a national problem. Furthermore, we have been constantly<br>told by the people in charge of education, that ours is the best educational<br>system in the world; consequently, if it is the best, there is no reason</p>
<p>being concerned about it. Now that it&#x27;s becoming apparent that there are</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>ether countries in the world that can rise and do the same things that we can,<br>the time is right for political leaders to step out or to step forth and tell</p>
<p>us this, and I am sure that if our people were really informed what our<br>situation is, they would do something about it, but they must stop this constant<br>talk that our school system is the best in the world when the facts show other-</p>
<p>wise,</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>I would agree with Admiral Rickover that education in this country -- I suppose<br>in any country could be better, Education can always be better. Our education<br>simply isn&#x27;t good enough, It wasn&#x27;t good enough even before some kind of</p>
<p>threat seemed to be posed from Russia.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>I should have said that you hadn&#x27;t quite built up the feeling among young<br>people and parents that it was fun to learn, It&#x27;s just as much fun for a<br>clever boy or a clever girl to learn as it is to drive a motor car, and I don&#x27;t<br>think you have got that quite firmly imbedded in people&#x27;s minds in America.<br>I - forgive me, that sounds as if I didn&#x27;t think much of the American educational<br>system. I do - I think some of your post-graduat. work is simply splendid,<br>but I&#x27;ll say this about the young people, you haven&#x27;t got this true idea that</p>
<p>it&#x27;s fun to learn,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I think we have the -- too much of an idea of fun, Miss West. I think that&#x27;s<br>one of the things that&#x27;s wrong with our undergraduate work. It&#x27;s nearly all</p>
<p>fun and everybody&#x27;s having ...</p>
<p>WEST:</p>
<p>You get me wrong, Admiral, Forgive me cutting in, but what I mean is - it&#x27;s</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>fun to do work that is hard. It&#x27;s fun to get up against a problem that&#x27;s dif-<br>ficult. I don&#x27;t mean having courses in making fudge. I don&#x27;t mean that. I<br>mean that young people find it fun to tackle mathematics, fun to tackle physics,</p>
<p>fun to tackle a difficult language.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>But most people, since they have not been taught that education is anything but<br>fun, are not concerned about this, and it is necessary that all of our people,<br>particularly our leaders, become aware of this, and this was the reason, I<br>believe, for Mr. Murrow&#x27;s first question - ‘Why is this not of concern in a<br>current political campaign?&quot; It is because the vast majority of our politicians,</p>
<p>of our leaders in government, and of course, our people do not understand this.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>I think it&#x27;s a frightful thing at elections that politicians never want to<br>make people feel unhappy about their future, and you are among -~ you are up<br>against the toughest assignment in the world. You are trying to convince<br>people that they&#x27;ve got to look after themselves if they are not going to</p>
<p>go down the drain.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>You are blaming the politicians ..e.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>And they&#x27;d much rather believe that they were looked after by fairy godmothers,<br>and it&#x27;s a terribly difficult thing ever to get that across in -- to the mass<br>of the public even in a daily paper, but for a politician to get it across to</p>
<p>the people, is asking a very great deal of that politician, indeed.</p>
<p>=. 5:</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I disagree with you, Miss West, I think the politicians are the most capable<br>people in the world, They are the only ones who have to face issues, and as<br>you know, politics has been defined as the art of the possible, and they must<br>get things done, I think the real fault lies in people like you and Mr, Van<br>Doren, who are poets and writers, You should have been using your talents all</p>
<p>these years to show people what the real situation is.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>I don&#x27;t know why you assume that I have been arch ... supporting educational<br>things that made people learn how to make fuege, or life adjustment, or any-</p>
<p>thing of that sort,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>You must have a guilty conscience, I didn&#x27;t intimate that at all,</p>
<p>WEST:<br>I have certainly not got that weakness, because when I was at school, what I<br>enjoyed most of all was Latin and mathematics which I was very bad at, and I<br>know they are enjoyable to do and a great service to mankind, and I have</p>
<p>never -- I don&#x27;t know why -- go and attack somebody else but not me.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I am sorry. I should have realized that you are a woman, Miss West, I should</p>
<p>not have attacked you.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>Well, listening to your voice, I can well realize that you are a man and have</p>
<p>all the properties of masculine logic,</p>
<p>«6%</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>Of course, I should like to think that Hiss West&#x27;s original suggestion that<br>education should always be fun - that is to say, should be enjoyed, is not</p>
<p>inconsistent with Admiral Rickover&#x27;s urgent ...</p>
<p>WEST:</p>
<p>It isn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>..surgency upon us all to realize what the world faces. I think the job of the</p>
<p>statesman -- let&#x27;s say statesman instead of politician -- the job of the</p>
<p>statesman who may appear on the horizon before too long, will be to convince<br>us that we must know more - that our children&#x27;s mathematics must not be</p>
<p>the pitifully inadequate thing that it is now by and larg in this country.<br>Convince us not only that but convince us that we want to change this -- that<br>it would be, not only good for every -- for the country that we knew wore, but<br>that it would be more aggreable to us if we knew more. After all, the heritage<br>that we have, the thing that we call liberal education, the education that for<br>centuries, even milleniums, has existed in the West, designed to make men</p>
<p>free to use their minds, is half scientific and mathematical, and half<br>literary. ile have tended to forget that first half. Many people in this<br>country mean by liberal education a Literary education, That mistake was</p>
<p>tragic.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>r agree with you, Mr. Van Doren. A liberal education can be brought completely<br>up to date, For example, two hundred years ago, a liberal education consisted<br>of studying philosophy and the classical languages. Then, as it beczme</p>
<p>necessary to know modern languages, the liberal education shifted to modern</p>
<p>Se a</p>
<p>languages. As it became necessary to know mathematics and physics and other<br>sciences, it shifted to that, so that we do have this misconception of what a<br>liberal education is. What we have done in this country is to cut ourselves<br>off from the stream of Western civilization. We must get back to it, because<br>the methods of teaching schools in the test which were developed painfully<br>over twenty-five hundred years ago, were designed to teach people how to<br>think to face any possible situation which might arise. On the other hand,<br>many of the courses in our public schools concern themselves with trivia --<br>with how to fish, how to make fudge, which Miss est seems to be partial to.<br>How to tell whether you are really in love. Now these are the things which</p>
<p>are not the business of the schools at all.</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>Now, Admiral, Admiral, in the interest of strict accuracy, Miss West did not</p>
<p>advocate the making of fudge, did you, Miss West.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>Not in the least. I don&#x27;t see why sucha clever man cannot hear what a woman<br>says who is not so clever, but does, I think, express herself with reasonable<br>plainness, I feel there must have been a defect in the auditory education of</p>
<p>the Admiral,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>Now we have examples of suburbs in the United States where every boy, by the<br>time he is allowed to drive, has an automobile, but where the schools have<br>to be run on a two-shift basis, because the people will not support additional<br>taxes for schools. This is an intolerable situation and shows that there is<br>something vastly lacking in the United States. It certainly is vastly</p>
<p>lacking when a country such as Russia, with a standard of living only one-third</p>
<p>ae re</p>
<p>of ours, spends two to three times as much in proportion on schools than we</p>
<p>do, This ig something which should -- which should cause us to reflect.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>Admiral, you might give a great deal of reassurance and comfort to the<br>American people who have been listening to you if you assure them that your<br>desire that they become better educated - that their children become better</p>
<p>educated, is not the same thing as the desire that we become like Russia.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>That is correct, sir. Many of the professional educationists have accused</p>
<p>me of advocating the Russian school system. I have never said that.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>I know you haven&#x27;t.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>They are very clever at fouling the issue, For example, they frequently say<br>what business does a naval officer have talking about education, Now, it so<br>happens that in 1806, when the Prussians reformed their own education system,<br>they chose Von Humboldt, a naturalist, to do so, and in England, it was<br>Matthew Arnold, the poet, who reformed the system. He went to France; he<br>saw the system of central control over education which existed there in the<br>mid-nineteenth century under Napoleon the Third, and when some people in<br>England objected because France was autocratic, he said it made no difference,<br>that the educational system was good, the use it ‘would be put to would<br>depend upon the social customs of the particular country in which it was</p>
<p>being -- in which it was being used,</p>
<p>a ere er er ere ee ee er et</p>
<p>a Oe<br>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>You know ee.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>May I just say something about the Russian passion for education - devotion<br>to education? I do think people ought to realize that that&#x27;s much less a<br>Communist thing than a Slav thing. In Yugoslavia, everybody wanted their<br>children to be educated, Education was fairly easy to them, for one thing,<br>because they have prodigious memories, I have never seen anything like it.<br>The children can learn pages of poetry over night, But I have seen peasants<br>in Macedonia whose one passion was that their children should go to the<br>university, and who participated very gladly in all the study of their<br>children, loved to hear what they were studying, and you have to remember<br>also, that under the Tsardom, there was good urban education -- unusually<br>good urban education in Russia, The rural education was bad but even a working<br>class boy, if he was clever, in St. Petersburg, could get an exceptional<br>education, This is not a Communist thing. It&#x27;s not an after-war -~ post-war<br>Siention, It is a long-standing feature of Russian life, and it&#x27;s due to<br>social ideas -- parents approved of education. They thought that it was a</p>
<p>noble, exciting thing.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>But the thing that the Russians have done which is unusual is that they have<br>thrown the enitre weight of the state for education, realizing that in a</p>
<p>modern, technological society, no country can advance unless it does so.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>I was interested a few minutes ago to hear Miss West speak of Macedonia. That</p>
<p>reminds me, by a rather round-about memory, of what happened in the ancient</p>
<p>- 10 -</p>
<p>Greek world, Athens made the tragic mistake of trying to be like Sparta. In<br>the end, both Athens and Sparta were swallowed up by Macedonia. That reminds<br>me of something that I believe very profoundly -- that whatever we do to<br>improve our education, and we must do much, and I think soon, we must continue<br>to be ourselves, We must not do this because we want to be like somebody</p>
<p>else, We must do this in order to be ourselves most truly.</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>This three-way conversation between Admiral Rickover in Washington, Mark Van<br>Doren, in Connecticut and Rebecca West in Buckinghamshire will continue im-</p>
<p>meadiately after this word from our sponsor.</p>
<p>COMMERCIAL</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>Well, what about the proposal for speeding up the training of the unusually<br>gifted students -- special classes, special schools, in order that the<br>nation muy have advantages of the skills that can be developed by these</p>
<p>people whose are unusually gifted?</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>I must confess at various times I&#x27;ve worried about the implications of it,<br>particularly I was the other day when I read an article that made it clear<br>that some one thinks there should be a differentiation between the better<br>and the worse students even as early as the second grade, I-- 1 think</p>
<p>this could be disastrous to our general education.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>The subject of when we separate out our children is, of course, a very con-</p>
<p>troversial one. You must remember, however, that the real work of this</p>
<p>«= 11»</p>
<p>world -- the real knowledge that is pushed forward is by -- is -- is by less<br>than one per cent of the people. Now, in an ordinary time when there was</p>
<p>no threat of war, it might be desirable to spread education equally among<br>all groups of people, among all -~- all, no matter what their intellectual<br>capacity was, but we can&#x27;t do that now even if we wished to, We must</p>
<p>nourish the very few people who can get ahead,</p>
<p>VAN DOREN;<br>Ultimately, I am sure, it is -- it is sensible to suppose that the students<br>who can go ahead the best and who can absorb most of the disciplines that<br>are necessary should be given the opportunity to go still further and re-<br>ceive every kind of fayor and benefit that a first rate mind deserves, but</p>
<p>up to some point, I should think that would be at the end of high school.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>Democracy does not mean that everybody is treated equally. Democracy</p>
<p>means that every one is given an equal opportunity, and each person is</p>
<p>permitted to advance at his own pace. ‘e have no right in a democracy<br>or in any other form of government to hold people back for the sake of<br>others who are less capable, provided we give the others a chance. We<br>are faced with a grave danger. The other side is treasuring its intel-<br>lectual children. It -- it considers their trained people as their gold<br>reserve and we must do likewise, and I think we can carry the democratic</p>
<p>idea too far, particularly in this time of danger.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>Well, I -- I can&#x27;t agree with the Admiral&#x27;s suggestion that the democratic<br>idea can be carried too far, It cznnot be carried too far if -- if</p>
<p>properly understood. 1 think it might come down to the question of how</p>
<p>~ 12 -</p>
<p>good your teacher is. A good teacher, confronted with better and worse<br>students, manages to make them all better -- even the better ones become</p>
<p>better, Perhaps the -- the student is always a better teacher than the teacher,<br>but the -- but the bright student - the excellent student will benefit up to<br>some point from having to realize how difficult it is for others to understand<br>what he understands easily, because his job, eventually, is to be the job</p>
<p>of explaining things.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>Mr, Van Doren, are your observations based on experience or on hope,</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>No. My observations are based on the experience that I have as a teacher.<br>I have never, in my own teaching, revealed any sense I had that some<br>students were better than others. I have always assumed that they were all<br>good, and this assumption works miracles with students who haven&#x27;t thought<br>they were good, They often have become good because some one believes</p>
<p>they are.</p>
<p>RICKOVER: ;<br>Now the Europeans, of course, have solved this problem. They do permit<br>all children to go to school together for about five years or so. At the<br>end of that time, they find out which children can no longer benefit as much<br>from theoretical education, and shift them over to some vocational training</p>
<p>in some move theoretical education. This seems to be a pretty good time to</p>
<p>make the division,</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>Well, now, about what time would that be - at what age?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>That would be about eleven or twelve.</p>
<p>WEST:</p>
<p>It&#x27;s eleven, and we think it&#x27;s too early. We&#x27;re modifying it.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s too early, too.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>Yes, It&#x27;s very hard on the late developer, and some of the best people</p>
<p>are late developers,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>There are not so many so-called late developers who really develop. Our<br>educational testing service has facts in this respect, and when some one - the<br>people who are late generally don&#x27;t come through too well, and I think we</p>
<p>are too kindly to people who don&#x27;t do well,</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>I think it might be dangerous to -- I am sure you dont mean this, Admiral -<br>it might be dangerous to foster the notion that we were somehow making<br>classes of persons. I don&#x27;t mean social classes but classes distinguished<br>by the term intellectual on the one hand - technological on the other hand -</p>
<p>occupational or whatever.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>Any man, no matter who he is, could do much better and could arrive at greater<br>talents and understanding if he made a conscious attempt to use his mind, but</p>
<p>most of us, because life is so easy in the United States and in England, and</p>
<p>~ 1b</p>
<p>even in European countries, tend not to use our minds. We don&#x27;t have to.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>Or as Miss West might say - we don&#x27;t realize how much fun it is, because there<br>is no greater pleasure for a human being than to be human, and the specifically<br>human thing surely is the intellect. It&#x27;s the only thing that distinguishes</p>
<p>human beings from all other creatures as far as I know.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>The man -- the man who does not use his mind is the same as a man who is</p>
<p>deformed or maimed.</p>
<p>VAN DORET:</p>
<p>Is the same as - what - you say, Admiral?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>The man who doesn&#x27;t develop his mind is the same as a man who is deformed or</p>
<p>is -- or is maimed,</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>He is not a complete person.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>Or who has never Learned to smile,</p>
<p>Are you smiling right now, Admiral?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p># 45-6</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>I am smiling very broadly,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I see no reason to smile, Things are too serious, When I contemplate that<br>this most marvelous experiment in democracy may be on the way out because our</p>
<p>people don&#x27;t realize what we are really up against,</p>
<p>WEST:<br>It&#x27;s awfully difficult for people to accept that things may go wrong. The idea<br>of progress has been plugged too hard into the human mind, and I think that&#x27;s<br>something you&#x27;ve got to alter in peoples&#x27; minds, They must realize that<br>civilization hangs by a hair - that it&#x27;s only by continous effort of our<br>ancestors, even our non-human ancestors, that we&#x27;re here at all, and that we<br>have to go on trying and fighting and’ trying and fighting to keep the good<br>things in existence. It seems to me quite an inspiring ideal, but people</p>
<p>haven&#x27;t got it,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I agree with Miss West. I think we must be made to realize that each genera-<br>tion must rewin its own liberty. No generation - no people can long ride on<br>what its ancestors accomplished, We must each fight over and over again be-</p>
<p>cause once a liberty is won and not used, it&#x27;s destroyed,</p>
<p>VAN DORE:<br>Sometimes, Admiral, I hear it said that no number of speeches or statements<br>to this effect will make any difference in this country, Something has got to<br>happen, Maybe something quite dreadful has got to happen, Now to be sure,<br>that thing could be so dreadful that nothing could be done later, Do you --</p>
<p>do you have faith that you and other people can Say what you are saying with</p>
<p>a [Te</p>
<p>enough force and enough conviction so that enough people will believe you?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>IL am not sure that it has too much of an effect.</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>Well, I&#x27;d like to put this question to all of you - why is it that we in this<br>country are unwilling or unable to accept or comprehend unpleasant information?<br>For example, what was happening to Russian education was known for five or<br>six years, fully reported, but until the Sputniks illuminated it, no one<br>seemed to care - no one bothered about it. The same thing is now true with<br>Russian economic penetration throughout the world, The facts are known but</p>
<p>no one seems to get concerned about it. Why is that?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>It is fully reported, Ed. We simply do not wish to believe unpleasant things<br>as you just said. We have a hope or a belief based on the fact that we have<br>never lost a war, that everything will come out all right in the end. We are<br>a democracy. We have a multi-purpose society whose major objective is to see<br>that people are well fed, well clothed, well housed, and happy, and these<br>items take the first -- make the first claim on our production. If we need<br>to get money for military purposes, for research and development, for basic</p>
<p>research, or for education, we must fight and argue for those things.</p>
<p>WEST:</p>
<p>Mr. Murrow, didn&#x27;t you ask why it was so?</p>
<p>MURROW:</p>
<p>Yes, I did, Miss West.</p>
<p>-17-</p>
<p>WEST:<br>you asked why it was so. Well, isn&#x27;t it that life is really extraordinarily |<br>difficult - that people have simple minds. We have only been able to survive<br>because we can put ourselves into an optimistic frame of mind on very little</p>
<p>evidence, Well, once we establish civil order and we can go around the</p>
<p>streets in relative safety, then we kid jourselves into the idea the whole<br>world is safe, and I think it&#x27;s very much easier in a country that&#x27;s known</p>
<p>as many disasters as Russia, that lived so uncomfortably, that&#x27;s had people<br>coming at night to take you away to concentration camps - you there have a<br>people that&#x27;s prepared for the worst; whereas, you can live in an American</p>
<p>city or a British city, and except in time of war, you don&#x27;t feel that anything</p>
<p>terrible is happening, and you have to really brace yourself and be a person</p>
<p>who says -- &quot;I am going to face reality. I am going to look behind the surface<br>of things.&quot;&#x27; We are a soft race in some ways. I mean the human race, although<br>we&#x27;re hardy in others, and we are apt to kid ourselves on that, and I think<br>the only way to got over that is to be thoroughly well educated, I get back</p>
<p>to that point. If you&#x27;ve read Shakespeare, you do realize this is a tragic</p>
<p>universe.</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>We -- we seem to be more concerned with peace in the pocketbook in this</p>
<p>country than any other thing.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>Yes. There is no way out of it except being sensitive and intelligent. I am</p>
<p>with you in that; education is what we need,</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>I agree with you in what you said about the Russians through famine and</p>
<p>= 18.«</p>
<p>revolution and concentration camps, having a better concept of the dangers that<br>are there all the time, and I believe the people in Hurope have that feeling, too,<br>because they have been subject to many wars, We in this country have never had</p>
<p>that.</p>
<p>MURROW:</p>
<p>Well, are you saying that it&#x27;s too long since we in this country have suffered?</p>
<p>RICKOVER:<br>I hope itis not so, but it may be that history repeats itself; that it may take<br>great suffering to cause us to realize: the situation. I think we might<br>approach -- approach it from this standpoint - that we should investigate why<br>we have these optimistic beliefs - why we think we arenot immune to the same</p>
<p>laws that have governed all other peoples throughout history.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:<br>A democracy which has been awakened to danger and necessity has a resource<br>that I believe no totalitarian state ever has, because if nothing else, the<br>government has faith in its people and has confidence that it&#x27;s -- the education</p>
<p>of its people is a resource for its own sake.</p>
<p>WEST:<br>We&#x27;re living in an awfully complicated world. We are really not doing so badly</p>
<p>considering the problems are so great.</p>
<p>L</p>
<p>RICKOVER:</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not doing badly -- we&#x27;re still alive.</p>
<p>WEST:</p>
<p>That&#x27;s true enough.</p>
<p>« 15 =</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>Yell on that note we must end this three way conversation. Good night, Miss</p>
<p>West in Buckinghamshire.<br>WEST:<br>Good night, Ed.<br>MURROW:<br>Good night, Admiral Rickover in Washington,<br>RICKOVER:<br>Good night.</p>
<p>MURROW:</p>
<p>And good night, Professor Mark Van Doren in Connecticut.</p>
<p>VAN DOREN:</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>MURROW:</p>
<p>Next week&#x27;s guests in just a moment.</p>
<p>COMMERCIAL</p>
<p>MURROW:<br>Next week, on SMALL WORLD, Peter Ustinov, Sol Hurok and Governor McKeldin of</p>
<p>Maryland. Good night and good luck.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER:<br>Next week, SMALL WORLD will be sponsored by Renault, the car that makes</p>
<p>driving fun again.</p>
