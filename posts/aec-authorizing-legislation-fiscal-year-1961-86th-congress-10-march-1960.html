      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document, detailing the 1960 AEC Authorizing Legislation Hearings, features Admiral Hyman Rickover&#x27;s compelling testimony on two key areas: the Shippingport Atomic Power Station and nuclear submarines. Rickover underscores Shippingport&#x27;s vital role as a transparent research and development plant, citing its impressive fuel burnup rates (averaging 1,990 megawatt-days per ton, peaking at 8,770 MWd/ton in its natural uranium blanket) and the pragmatic decision to upgrade its core to 150 megawatts, utilizing a ~$4 million heat sink for excess energy to facilitate ongoing, uninterrupted research for all water reactors. Concurrently, he issues a stark warning about the Soviet submarine threat, estimating their fleet at 450 vessels with a 100-per-year build capacity, and passionately argues that the U.S. is &quot;frittering away a lead&quot; by not constructing more attack submarines (despite a claimed U.S. capability of 10 additional per year). Rickover contends that short-range, submarine-launched missiles represent a *greater* threat than ICBMs due to their accuracy and the vulnerability of U.S. coastal industry. The hearings also include AEC Chairman John A. McCone&#x27;s explanation of how the commission internally reallocated approximately $11 million from various projects (e.g., Euratom R&amp;D, Eniwetok Proving Grounds) to fully fund Project Rover, the nuclear rocket program, demonstrating a strategic approach to budget management.</p>

<p>Energy commission '</p>
<p>Mr. Luepecke. I would like to correct an error in our testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Chairman, when it was indicated that the size of this project was the same as for last year. This was in error. In fact, last year’s project was $3 million and this is $4 million. ,</p>
<p>Representative Hotmre.p. I noted that 2 years ago you had $2 mil- lion, last year $8 million, and this year $4 million. i appreciate the increases involved in this. I am wondering if the increase is in line</p>

<p>inte cn A</p>
<p>Representative Houriip. The thing we are concerned with, as Sen- ator Anderson said, is that we start on one of these and it seems to go up, both in capital cost by changes and also in the cost of operation.</p>
<p>In line with this $105 million accelerator at Stanford, we wonder if you start at $105 million if you are going to end up at $200 million.</p>
<p>Dr. McDaniru. Perhaps during the later hearings before the com- mittee we can explain this. I believe our experience on these other machines will help us in preparing a better estimate on the Stanford accelerator.</p>
<p>Representative Hormieiy. We are going into that in more detail as soon as reports are available.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Again speaking from the same side of the tossed coin as Mr. Holifield, the design of this particular machine in relation to capital cost would have cost infinitely more if the previous design had been used. This is a capital-cost-cutting design, as I under- stand it ; is that right ?</p>
<p>Dr. McDanret. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You get a good deal more for your dollar in terms of intensity and force than you do with the older.</p>
<p>Representative Horirieip. It is a capital cost, but the ratio of value appears to be greater to the dollars; is that right?</p>
<p>br. McDaniev. That is correct.</p>
<p>Representative Hosser. If it was considered in cost per kilowatt as we do powerplants, it would be a cut down in the cost.</p>
<p>Representative Wrstnanp. Is there anything comparable to this any place else in the world?</p>
<p>Dr. McDanien. There is no machine under construction that I know of, and I believe we have good information. There is no ma- chine, » 12.5 Bev. proton accelerator, of the high intensity of this machine: no, sir, It would be a unique machine and highly applauded by the scientific community.</p>
<p>Representative Horan. Are there further questions on this?</p>
<p>If not, we will pass on to section (b).</p>
<p>At this'time we will ask Admiral Rickover to come forward.</p>
<p>Mr. Lugpecks. Section L07(b), project 60-e-12, is a request for an inerease in authorization for the alterations of the Shippingport reactor facilities from the authorized $5 million in the 1960 bill to a total of $9 million, to enable the Commission to go ahead with the increase of the core size to 150 megawatts, and to provide a heat dump</p>
<p>to take care of the excess steam over and above the capabilities of the present generating facilities.</p>
<p>r. . Representative Horirmp. Are there any questions on this? ~ Representative Van Zanpr. What is the cost to us now for a kilowatt of energy at the Shippingport plant? ; Admiral Rickover. You realize, Mr. Van Zandt, that on a develop- ~~ ment project such as Shippingport, cost figures on power generation</p>
<p>have fittte meaning. To give you a specific number, however, some- thing like 70 or 75 mills is of the right order. But it is not a realistic figure because we are doin things with the Shippingport plant you</p>
<p>- Representative Vaw Zanopr.</p>
<p>would never do in a plant built and devoted exclusively to the com- mercial generation of electric power.</p>
<p>Phat is the point I want to develop. In other words, this is a research and development plant.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir; this is a research and development project, and from this project we are obtaining by far the majority of knowledge being developed for all water reactor plants, both pres- surized and boiling. This information is also of great value to other types of reactors.</p>
<p>Questions on the cost of the Shippingport project have largely stopped in the last year when those who a0 to complain bitterly about the cost of Shippingport are running into the same high levels of costs themselves. do now the only question left to them is the cost of a unit of electric power from Shippingport.</p>
<p>One thing we do at Shippingport not done for any of the other plants is that we put down our real costs; there are no hidden costs or subsidies of any kind. All other reactors being built or planned, in computing their costs, assume they are going to run at a load factor of 80 percent.</p>
<p>You see, when you try to find out the cost from any of the com- mercial reactors, you can never get the complete figures. But the cost figures on Shippingport are always available to you because the only money we have is the money you appropriate. So that ties it right down, But you’ cannot find out from anyone else what their true costs are.</p>
<p>. Representative Van Zanpr. What does it cost us to operate the Ship- pingport lant ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It costs the Government about $2 million a year. I am not talking about the research and development. I am talking about what it costs the U.S. Government to run the plant.</p>
<p>Representative Hortrterp. Does that include fabrication of fuel?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. N 0, sir; that does not include research, develop- ment, or the fuel fabrication costs. The $2 million is an extra sum the Government puts in to carry out operational tests with the reactor</p>
<p>lant. If we stopped all research and development today, $2 million is what it would cost the U.S. Government to get the necessary test data out of Shippingport.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvt. Is the plant down at the present time?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Yes, sir; the plant is down for re ueling at the present time. In about 2 months we expect to have it back in opera- tion. —</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpt. What core is this?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We are still on the first core. This first core consists of a seed and a blanket. The first seed contained about 75 kilograms of fully enriched U2&quot; and the blanket has about 14 tons of natural uranium.</p>
<p>When we designed the plant, we estimated that the blanket of the first core would last for two seeds. We also estimated that the life of the first seed would be about 3,000 full-power hours. Actually, the seed ran for 5,800 full-power hours.</p>
<p>We are in the process of replacing this first seed with a second seed. The second seed will operate, we estimate, about 1,000 hours longer than the 5,800 hours of the first seed.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors in evaluating economics of nu- clear power from reactors using natural or slightly enriched unanium is the expression known as “megawatt-days per ton.” The Shi pping- port reactor has at present been subjected to a greater megawatt-days per ton burnup than an reactor in the world. I am talking about natural uranium. So all of the promises, all of the statements being made about the life of power reactors of any kind, are based largely on what we have proven so far at Shippingport.</p>
<p>This includes the British Calder Hal] type reactors, too. The average megawatt-days per ton, until the present time, to which we have subjected the Shippingpet natural uranium blanket, is about 1,990. That is average,</p>
<p>' Representative Hortrrerp, 1,990? dmiral Rickover, Yes, sir; 1,990 megawatt-days per ton average, n a reactor, the maximum burnup is about four times the average, So you must be careful when you question people about megawatt- days per ton that you ask them, “Are you talking about the average or the maximum burnup ?”</p>
<p>epresentative Honirrenp, In other words, some of the rods last longer than others? iral Rickover, Yes, sir; as you know, the megawatt-days per ton burnup depends on the neutron flux; the flux distribution js like that of a cosine curve. At the center there is a much higher burnup than there is at the ends or sides of the core.</p>
<p>The largest maximum burnup which has been obtained to date with natural uranium in any Operating reactor in the world, has been at Shippingport. So, anyone who js quoting figures on costs and life must inevitably base his estimates on Shippingport results. The actual] Shippingport burnup figures are 1,990 mMegawatt-days per ton average, with 8,770 megawatt-days per ton maximum,</p>
<p>presentative Horirenp. Relate this to the guarantee which an merican manufacturer gives to a foreign purchaser.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovrr. The guarantees aro all made on the basis of average figures. When a man comes around and tells you his reactor core will be subjected to 10,000 or so megawatt-days per ton, he is talking about average burnup figures, which means he is talking about</p>
<p>ires which are about five times as great as we have achieved in the</p>
<p>uippingport reactor in its 2 years of operation. With the present core we would have to operate Shippingport for about 10 yearg to prove out in an actual power reactor this 10,000 Megawatt-days per ton burnup. €presentative Horrrrenp, These new reactors are going to be dj f- ferent from Shippingport, and, therefore, from a technological stand- point, do you feel that this is why the fi ve-tines-life guarantee can given? Or do you feel that this is based more on speculation than it is based on analysis? .</p>
<p>iral Rickover, I can only say this, Mr. Holifield: If I were</p>
<p>&amp; contractor, I would not guarantee any such reactor. The Govern-</p>
<p>ment, because of its unlimited financial resources could. But as a contractor I would not, if I were running a business, guarantee 10,000 average megawatt days per ton.</p>
<p>am certainly not father to all wisdom in this field. There are many people who have looked into this matter. But from experience</p>

<p>Admiral Rickover. The plant was designed for 60,000 megawatts electrical net output, which means about 67,000 to 68,000 gross, the other 7,000 to 8,000 being used to service the plant itself. We have generating capacity for 100,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>Representative Hourim.p, With the old core?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. With the old core. We purposely installed a 100,000-kilowatt turbogenerator instead of a 60,000 one because we figured that some day we would get smart enough to design a core that would give us 100,000 kilowatts. So when we started designing the hew core we initially aimed at 100,000-kilowatt output. But after proceeding a while it appeared we could obtain 150,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>The Shippingport roject is so important. for developing basic re- actor information I thousht it, wise to take this subject up with Mr, McCone, and he agreed, as did your committee, a year ago, that we should proceed on the basis of a 150,000-kilowatt core.</p>
<p>So the real isstie now is how do we get the additional capacity to dissipate the energy in excess of 100,000 kilowatts, That is the real issue. The core which is presently installed was designed for 60,000 kilowatts. We installed generating capacity for 100.000 kilowatts, with the idea we would learn more as we went along to enable us to design a new core for 100,000 kilowatts,</p>
<p>ad we not. been so good in design we would not be here today. Our trouble stems from the fact that we have done too well. That is why we are in difficulty.</p>
<p>Chairman Anperson. Why do you propose a heat sink instead of adding electric generating facilities ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We did not propose a heat sink originally, Senator Anderson. Originally we proposed adding electrical generat- ing capacity, not only an additional 50,000 kilowatts, but an additional 75,000 kilowatts, because we figured we might run into the same problem later on—that on the third core we could get even more than 150,000 kilowatts,</p>
<p>’ We wanted to be prepared for future improvements, In view of the stringincy of Government funds and for other reasons, such as the problems connected with an intrast ate utility and a number of other technical and legal problems. the Commission decided, and I agreed with them, that we should approach the Duquesne Light Co. to see whether they would supply the additional 75,000-kilowatt generating capacity at their expense,</p>
<p>ou must realize that of all reactor contractors working with the AEC, Duquesne has been a most generous financial contributor. They have already put in $20 million of their own money on generating facilities. In addition they are paying for about 100 of the employees who are manning the Shippingport station.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they contributed about $5 million toward the develop- ment and construction of the plant itself. I believe these are pretty good indications of generous interest by a private utility company.</p>
<p>From their standpoint—they are, as vou know, an intrastate utility With no customers outside the State of Pennsylvania—they have done an outstanding job in cooperating with the Government.</p>
<p>When’ we ask them to put in an additional $23 million or so, that is another matter. You can understand the natural reluctance of an ‘ intrastate utility such as Duquesne to spend that much more money. So when the Commission asked me to develop this problem with Duquesne, I went to Mr. Fleger, the chairman of their board. He came up with the figure of about $23 million for the cost of an addi- tional 75,000-kilowatt gross nerating capacity. Of this $23 million, $8 million was for additional transmission faci ities.</p>
<p>Representatve Horirrep. How much was that figure?</p>
<p>' ‘Admiral Rrcxover. $5 million for the transmission facilities, which would havé to go in to be able to transmit the electricity to the city of Pittsburgh. eir plans at the present time do not include generating additional electricity from the Shippingport direction,</p>
<p>’ Representative Hortrrety. The existing lines could not carry it?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct; and they figured that this $5 million cost for transmission line expansion was a proper charge to make.</p>
<p>They estimated $18 million for the additional cost of the generating plant. Their pro sal amounted essentially to this: They would _ supply the sum o $23 million, and they wanted a contract to last 10 to 15 years so they would amortize the $23 million. Their proposal, essentially, amounted to the Government paying 6 percent interest annually on $23 million.</p>
<p>This was the real substance of the Duquesne proposal. In addition to that, they asked for guarantees from the Government on reactor output and on total yearly power generation. If we did not meet these guarantees requested by Duquesne, we would be obligated to make them up financially.</p>
<p>Shippingport being a research and development plant, we obviously could not go along with such a proposal. So the Commission ap- pointed an AEC I oard to look into the matter. The Board recom- mended against its acceptance. Mr. McCone then requested that I go back to Mr. Fleger to see if I could get better terms.</p>
<p>Duquesne stated they could not give us any better terms in view of the large sum of mone they had already invested. Then it was decided to go back to Duquesne and ask if they would, at their expense, put up a heat sink, similar to a condenser. They said they would do this, and that it would cost approximately $4 million. They could be willing to put up the $4 million, and to charge ap- proximately 6 percent interest, but the Government would not have to make any performance guarantees of any kind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the end of a 5-year eriod, which they were going to use to amortize this heat sink, the heat sink would belong to the Government. J tink this was an eminently reasonable proposal. But from the standpoint of the Government, after the Commission looked into it, it appeared that it would be cheaper for the Govern- ment to put the heat sink up itself. This is where this matter stands now.</p>
<p>Senator Gor. Mr. Chairman——</p>
<p>Representative Hori. Mr. Gore?</p>
<p>a eR SY</p>
<p>&lt; Se is</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Admiral, 'this is not directly on the point of your testimony ‘just. now, but it is certainly a related matter. While all the attention has been focused on the missile gap, I have been equally concerned with the submarine threat. From the state of reactor development which Congressman Holifield and Congressman Van Zandt witnessed in the Soviet Union several months ago, from the launching of the icebreaker, I have been concerned that perhaps they had the capacity for a nuclear submarine, with the multiplication of their submarine threat and possible development of missile capability from submarines.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you if you share my view or if you can discusg it in open session, if you obtained any information while you were</p>
<p>there, which led you to believe, as I have been led to believe, that:</p>
<p>the Soviets perhaps have such capability ?</p>
<p>‘I do not want to be specific in my questions, because I do not want to be in the position of eliciting any classified information. But if you have any observations on this line, I would be pleased to receive them. '</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. Senator Gore, I cannot, of course, go into detail, as you yourself recognize, on specific questions about our missile or submarine strength in an open meeting.</p>
<p>Senator Gorw. I have not asked specific questions,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I understand, sir. I'can tell you this, and this has been testified to before by myself and by other Navy wit- nesses: That the Russians are estimated to have about 450 submarines at the poecrit time, the majority of them being oceangoing subma- rines; that they have the capacity to construct about 100 submarines &amp; year, so «There is no question in my mind, or, I am sure, in the mind of anyone who is knowledgable in this field, that they are making</p>
<p>Strenuous attempts to develop a nuclear submarine capability. J understand when Mr, Khrushchey visited Camp David he was quite interested in seeing the motion pictures of our nuclear submarines breaking through the ice,</p>
<p>you know, another of our nuclear submarines, the Sargo, punched through the ice at the North Pole just a few daysago. Ifthe Russians wished, they could in 5 years or so have more nuclear-powered sub- marines than we have, if they make up their minds to build them on a priority basis.</p>
<p>Senator Gorz. Would you say that again?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I said in 5 years or so———</p>
<p>Senator Gorn. Mr, Chairman, I cannot hear the witness.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It is my opinion, and 1 am not necessarily re-</p>
<p>flecting the views of the Defense istablishment, that in about 5 years they can have more nuclear submarines operating than we.</p>
<p>n my opinion, we are frittering away a lead in perhaps the only weapons system in which we are ahead. We are not taking advantage of our lead by building enough nuclear submarines at the present</p>

Senator Aiken, there is no question about the otential, because it has been stated frequently by military people who 1ave testified to committees of Congress that they have the capacity to build about 100 submarines a year. : Senator Arxen. And it would depend to what degree they are will- ing to sacrifice other activities; would it not? Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. Senator Arken, There is a difference bet ween what they could build 2 raat | and what they may build, and that goes for us, too, Pane ee hare Admiral Rickover. Yes, but the sacrifice here, ] am sure, would not er be anywhere near as great, because their standard of living is about one-third of ours. However, in their military sector, they do not use less manpower than we do. . fom ‘Senator Aiken. How does our capacity to build compare with theirs ? Admiral Rickover. We do not have the capacity to build as many as they, but we do have the capacity to build many more than we are bibdingy now. Mr. Van Zandt discussed that with me the other day. I believe that we could easily build 10 additional attack submarines a year. We have the submarine building facilities as well as the ‘| ' manufacturing capacity for the nuclear and machinery components, May T repeat what I told you, sir? Coa ‘ Representative Van Zanpr. Yes. ion Admiral Rrexover. I told Mr. Van Zandt that we now have three Rae sources of supply for buying the complete equipment, on a competitive lump-sum basis, for 10 more nuclear attack submarines a year. Senator Arken. Could we reach a point where it would not be prac- tical to go beyond that? When you get enough submarines, wou iq you continue to build more, or would Russia do the same? Admiral Rickover. Senator Aiken, we surely lave not reached that ‘point yet. . Senator Arken. I agree with you on that, Admiral Ricxover. I think we could safely build 10 more a year for several years. By that time—of course, we might have peace, we might both turn all our swords into plowshares—isn’t that the expres- sion? Senator Arxen. I see. a al Chairman Annerson. What we have thus far agreed upon is that @ * Vice Admiral Rickoyer ayrees with Captain Van Zandt that. the : Navy should yo ahiond</p>
<p>en ite pnt ae</p>
<p>1 3 i Maa cea aca cee Pe a sein</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. If you put it in those terms, sir, you should say Captain Van Zandt agrees with Vice Admiral Rickover. If you say Admiral Rickover and Congressman Van Zandt, that is another ting.</p>
<p>Chairman Anperson. I reverse the order.</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to have protocol here, Tinsist I yielded only for a question.</p>
<p>Chairman Anperson. [ never served in the Navy, so Tam happy to haye my proper classification and order of preference straightened out.</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Mr, Chairman, I would like to ask one more question of the admiral.</p>
<p>Coming as it does from a layman, do you share the concern I have felt that a fleet of several hundred submarines with missile capability</p>
<p>Might pose a threat at Jeast equal to the threat of ICBM's?</p>
<p>Adiniral Rickover. 1 believe that at the present time the ballistic missile launching submarine is the best deterrent we have, Asa inat~ ter of interest, T just came back this morning from the trials of our second Polaris submarine, the Patrick Henry.</p>
<p>Since what we are really discussing is our freedom, that is a pretty good name for the ship. Her trials were successful. Before the end of the year the Navy expects to have the George Washington, the first Polaris submarine, and the Patrick Henry, on station.</p>
<p>IT do not think it would be at all necessary to have hundreds of Polaris submarines, because each of these subinarines has 16 missile tubes. T understand that. in consequence of Senator Anderson’s re- quest, the entire committee will have the opportunity to visit the George Washington, going to sea in her, over the weekend of the</p>
<p>— 9th and 10th of April. So you will see for yourselves the tremendous</p>
<p>deterrent each Polaris submarine constitutes,</p>
<p>I do not believe hundreds ure necessary. Only nine are authorized at the present time, with three additional requested in fiscal 1961. J understand the Navy may ask for an additional number, three or more, for fiscal 1961, ;</p>
<p>Senator Gorr. You have said that in your view the submarines with ballistic capability were our best counterthreat. I ask you about the threat to our own shores.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. From such weapons?</p>
<p>Senator Gorr. From such Weapons in the hands of a potential enemy.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That definitely is the case, sir. The Russians, according to information. which has been made public, have sub- marines which can fire missiles a minimum of 200 miles, perhaps as great as 800 miles, ;</p>
<p>With a missile range such as that, their submarines could easily destroy about 70 percent of our manufacturing capacity, because it is mostly concentrated along our coasts. That threat definitely exists. The reason that Captain—and T hope he soon makes admiral—Van Zandt was interested in asking for additional attack submarines, 10 a year, was to try to counter that threat, because the best way to com-</p>
<p>t an enemy submarine, particularly a nuclear submarine, is by our own nuclear submarines,</p>
<p>That was the basis for Mr. Van Zandt’s desire to build 10 more at- tack submarines a year, above and beyond the number currently being requested.</p>
<p>oes that answer your question, sir?</p>
<p>Senator Gore. Well, I think you intended to, but I wanted you to be a little more specific, if you could, by way of comparison,</p>
<p>With the present state of ballistic missiles in stockpiles, insofar as we know it, do you regard the potential threat from submarines with ballistic oxpabilaty as great to the United States as the ICBM threat</p>
<p>may be?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rickxover. Again, talking for myself, Senator Gore, I think it is even greater, because at the present time, due to the existing imperfections in missiles, and, of course, this will be rectified, the missile with a shorter range is easier to fire and certainly would be more accurate than one with a greater range.</p>
<p>It is an easier job to fire a short-range missile than it is a long- range missile. This is where the use of the subinarine comes in. Assuming, for example, the Russians had 100 submarines lying off the east: coast ; they could fire missiles, say, at the 200- or 300-mile range. There is certainly more of a chance of hitting a target at a short range than there is at a long range. The missiles are not as large and the problems not as great.</p>
<p>enator Gort. Thank you.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I have just one question along this line, Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>Would you judge in general that possessing a well-rounded nuclear submarine fleet would be of greater value to the U.S.S.R. or the United States?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It would be of greater value to the U.S.S.R. than to the United States for the simple reason that it is almost in- conceivable the people of this country would initiate a war.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am thinking from the standpoint of de- terrence, and so forth, the general objectives of the country.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. From a physical standpoint, they would be better off because their industry and their population are not as concentrated as ours. In fact, for several years they have been de- liberately planning, and they are succeeding in decentralizing both their industrial and their scientific and development. facilities.</p>
<p>We have talked a great deal about doing the same but we have not done anything so far. I doubt, with our national optimism, we will do anything about it.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I included in my question a well-rounded fleet, and that would bring up our attack submarines to counter their missile submarines.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I tried to summarize my answer to your ques- tion, sir. I think they would always have some advantage from the fact that they would not be as vulnerable because of the dispersion of their warmaking potential.</p>
<p>The other point is the one of national intention. I do not believe the national intention of the United States to go to war with another</p>
<p>country would be anywhere near as great as for another country to</p>
<p>go to war with us.</p>

<p>o&gt; Representative Hosmer. Let us put it down this way, then: Is a oat nuclear submarine fleet of greater or lesser defensive value to us than a a submarine fleet is of offensive value to the U.S.S.R.? vine _ Admiral Rickover. I believe the offensive always has the advantage, : Representative Hosmer. Thank you.</p>
<p>Chairman Anprrson. Mr. Chairman eu . Representative Horarrety. Senator Anderson?</p>
<p>Chairman ANnpersox. A moment ago, the way you said that the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was going on the George Washington, left some doubt as to whether the Vice Admiral was going along on the George Washington. wondered if it might be necessary to have Captain, soon to be Admiral, Van Zandt invite you to go, or whether the committee could now jnvite you to come along with us, because you have been with us on the other two trips and we would not want you absent on this</p>

It looks like a stacked deck to me. Chairman Anverson. In behalf of the common people, Admiral, I invite you to come along. Mr. McCone, I have to be on the floor, and I have one question.</p>
<p>There appeared in the Wall Street Journal this morning an edi- eae</p>
<p>torial entitled “Not Everything at Once.” This will be out of order, qe</p>
<p>but the chairman said I could. It says: The critics of big government spending ought not overlook the Ininner in 1</p>
<p>which the Atomic Rnergy Commission hag got hold of the money it says it needs</p>
<p>for the development of a nuclear-powered rocket. The whole set of elrcum-</p>
<p>stances showed that sometimes a battle is won by those who believe that Govern-</p>
<p>ment spending does not always have to be as big as its sponsors say.</p>
<p>It goes on to point out that Mr. Maurice Stans, Director of the i Pett Bil Budget, had trimmed down things to where there was not quite enough i : &quot; money for project Rover and that you, spurred on by the head of the | ‘ Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, went to work on the Budget i - I have publicly expressed my deep appreciation for the fact that i you have gone ahead, but I think these questions this morning which 7 Ae , relate to different types of defensive devices indicate that we need not | (&gt; only submarines but need atomic propulsion for vehicles, i</p>

<p>ssi Para aS Nei a 178 AEC AUTHORIZING L</p>
<p>I wonder if you would comment on this article a little bit. Tt lea ves the impression that the AEC budget. is one that ean be reduced and shrunk several million dollars whenever anybody requires it. Tt was my impression that this represented some real sacrifices on the part of AEC, and a real, sincere effort on the purt of AEC to try to meet a national situation. I thought T would like to have your comments, if T might, on the record, for this meet ing.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. Yes, Tf you will recall, Senator Anderson, our original request. for money was reduced by about $13 million, as I remember.</p>
<p>Chairman ANperson. That was for project Rover.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. Yes, It was reduced by the Bureau of the Budget after consultation with NASA, the using agency, because the schedule for progress on Rover appeared to NASA to be out of phase with the then schedule of the Saturn project, and Rover was to be an upper stage of Saturn.</p>
<p>They argued that. the project. could be decelerated somewhat and brought along more jn consonance with Saturn. Later the President authorized $195 million, or $135 million additional money, for NASA which, among other things, accelerated the Saturn project.</p>
<p>I went to the Bureau of the Budget and asked for a restoration of the funds on the ground that there was a new phasing and we had to proceed with Rover in keeping with the new Saturn program ; there- fore, we wanted to reestablish the original program which we had requested.</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Budget came back and said that they were Sympathetic with that, they would approve the authorization, but they asked if we could find the money hy reapportioning nioney from other sources, J told this committée in two hearings, T believe, of that decision, and snid that T felt it was my Obligation and our obliga- tion to see whether we did have funds fron; some sources, fron) reserves, or from projects which we were carrying forward at a little less cost than our estimate,</p>
<p>IT thought that was the first thing to do. If we could not find the money, we would then go to the Bureau of the Budget. We found money from severa] sources,</p>
<p>In the first place, the Euratom research and development program had not. taken the money that was appropriated by several million dollars, and, therefore, we moved $3 million from that project over to the operati ng cost for Project Rover.</p>
<p>Tn 1958 and 1959 we had authorization and *ppropriations for mis- cellaneous development. work and added projects for the Eniwetok Proving Grounds that we could take $4.4 million for transfer to Project</p>
<p>There was a similar situation at the National Reactor ‘Festing Station for electrical distribution. Tt appears that the scope of our work has changed somewhat and there is a saving of $1.7 million, We moved tha t, too,</p>
<p>There was also the Tonopah Test Range project, a proposed 1961 project, which We, upon study, decided wo would not hive to proceed with, and that provided $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Egislation fiscal year“toe1</p>
<p>2 Beer 1</p>
<p>In total, from those projects, we recovered the $8 million that was EX . needed for the construction work in Nevada, and from the Euratom program we gathered up the $8 million for operations.</p>
<p>That established the level of funding at $21 million.</p>
<p>I think it is not unusual in a budget of $284 billion for a current, year and for a prior year to be able to, by a little careful screening of what you are oing, find money in this order. We regularly do it. If at the end of the fiscal year the year’s available funds are not obli- gated, the unobligated amount is reported and carried over and a pplied</p>
<p>q against requirements for the next year.</p>
<p>Representative Horirrenp. As a matter of fact, in this bill we have close to $20 million rescission of projects that have been either modified or annulled.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. That is right. After all, you are running $7 billion worth of facilities and 110,000 men, and there are bound to be changes that come up day to day and week to week.</p>
<p>That is the way this money was found. I do not. feel that this</p>
<p>* should be construed as a fact that money is being hoarded or not</p>
<p>. properly handled. I think this was an orderly thing to do. Chairman ANDERSON. | not. only agree with you, but I certainly ae commend the Atomic Energy Commission for the way it went about . it. Naturally, if we had resumed testing, your budget being made</p>
<p>out last fall, if we had resumed testing October 31 or January 1, the validity of some of these projects at Eniwetok, Tonopah, and others would have been very well establ ished, fo If the European nations, instead of coming in with just the Senn Fis reactor, had come in with four or fixe reactors, under the Euratom project, you would have needed the money in the budget. Mr. McConr. And probably more. Chairman Annersow, The fact. that they did not come in does not, indicate that the AEC was loose in the way of its budgeting or that this committee had been too liberal inthe way iC has authorized finds, : I was sort of: dist ressed to read the editorial, because it. js my im- pression that the Atomic Knergy Commission had been ext remely careful.

<p>Mr. McConr. As you know, the Commission is enthusiastic in its support of the Rover project. We think it is one of the very promising projects we have underway.</p>

<p>First, however, I will yield to Mr. Hosmer for one or two questions, Then we will get back to the projects.</p>
<p>Alterations ‘ro shippingport reactor facilities</p>
<p>Representative Hosarer. The ad hoe advisory committee report of</p>
<p>‘ebruary 15, in its Sununary, after stating that the core 2 represents</p>
<p>significant improvements and advances and should yield substantially valuable results, says—</p>
<p>We have been assured that planning and developmental work on core 2 with a</p>
<p>rating of 150 megawatts has already proceeded so far as to render moot the question of undertaking core 2 with a somewhat lower rate. We feel bound to say, however, that the review the committee was able to make did not convince them that the increased costs were warranted by the technical advantages of a rating above 100 megawats for which generating equipment is already installed,</p>
<p>That subjects both you and Mr. McCone, Admiral Rickover, to criticism, and I think’ the committee, itself. I would like to have something on the record that will at least, give us somewhat of a skirt- cleaning job.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I really must hold myself back to answer this question, because in my experience I have never found a committee that could do a job. You know the old expression that 2 committee cannot paint a picture, and that is exactly the situation you have here.</p>
<p>You will also find that this committee recommended stil] another committee, and Tam sure that that committee Will recommend still another committee, because we certainly want do not want te put com miltees out of business,</p>
<p>Reprewentative Honoenn. You are not talking about congressional committees now,</p>
<p>Admiral Rickoven, No; you asked me that question once before,</p>
<p>one ee ay</p>
<p>habia A iasabee rt</p>
<p>Representative Honirrmecp. I just want to keep the record straight</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Your authority derives from the Constitution. The other committees derive their authority from Government ex- penditures. There is quite a difference. So there is no comparison. You are performing a legal function which, of course, you should, and we could not have our form of government if you did not.</p>
<p>But I do not see how people who have not been immersed in highly technical problems, such as this, spend a short time ona problem and make valid technical decisions,</p>
<p>Today these technical matters are highly complex. They involve thousands of hours of computing-machine time, the work of thousands of scientists and engineers. Noman can sit down and look at a reactor design and arbitrarily say, “This is what we ought to do.” We have never found that to be the case,</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You can say categorically that the benefits to be gained from running this above 100 megawatts are worth the expense ¢</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Absolutely, sir. 1 think if you did not do it this way, you would be obliged to build a completely new large reactor. All of us are interested in saving money and in using the talent we have as economically as possible.</p>
<p>I will make another categorical statement: I think today if you wanted to be wise in spending money, you would pick out the success- ful development groups in any field, whether they are in rockets, missiles, reactors, and you would load them up as much as they per- mitted you to load them. No man who is really dedicated to his project will undertake developments he does not believe in.</p>
<p>The surest way to have a successful project is to let a man who be- heves in it work his head off doing it. That is the only way you can do it. You are people who are involved in the field of polities, and</p>
<p>ou know from your political sense that you can only get things done »y and through people, by judging who are the right people. That is all you can do; there is no other wiry,</p>
<p>Representative Hossrer. Thank you, Admiral,</p>
<p>I was going to ask if you were going to appoint the second commit- tee, but T will not do it now, Mr. MeCone.</p>
<p>Mr. McConr. I would like to comment on that particular paragraph in the report because it. was given serious consideration by the Commis- sion in a formal meeting,</p>
<p>We concluded that there Were reasons quite beyond the considera- tions of this Advisory Committee which would prompt us to pursne the development of core No, 2 at 150 megawatts. This was not made lightly. It was seriously considered,</p>
<p>There were some of the technical questions in core design and power density that could be proven, to be sure, with a 100-megawatt core. But all of the things we sought, including the demonstration of the</p>
<p>eapacity of the plant as a whole, could only be done if the core were brought up to 150 megawatts. For that reason, we disagreed with our Advisory Committee and, incidentally, we disagree with our Advisory Committee quite often. ;</p>
<p>Sometimes the Commission haa to consider responsibilities quite beyond the terms of reference of the particular committee,</p>
<p>tepresentative Hontrimnn. T do not think you have to have any fear at all that this committee is not completely behind bringing this up to</p>
<p>cine ie eS</p>
<p>| ae a ¥</p>
<p>Gals</p>
<p>150 megawatts and getting some operational experience at that for the period of time that it is necessary to develop the statistics that we need on fuel elements and other factors that are involved.</p>
<p>f would like to address myself, if I might, to the question of furnish- ing this additional capacity. .</p>
<p>What was the deciding factor on their part against this? Was it the interruptibility of service or was it the 8-mills per kilowatt-hour that we were charging them 4</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No; the idea was that this was an additional large investment on Duquesne’s part and they felt that they had ulready made the most significant financial investment of any utility company in the nuclear field. They did not feel it was incumbent on them to provide more money to improve the art.</p>
<p>They were quite willing to put up the facilities and charge the Government a 6-percent interest rate, plus getting governmental guar- antees of uninterrupted service. This uninterrupted service is not. compatible with the research and development we are trying to do at Shippingport.</p>
<p>Representative Horirrenp. 1 understand. ‘That is why I wondered if this was'a primary factor in their consideration. If they do need additional kilowatts in their system, and if they have to build con- ventional plants to obtain those kilowatts, and if we could furnish «iditional kilowatts from this plant at an attractive price to them, I wonder if that. was explored.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hontvrep. In other words, even a reduetion in price of the kilowatts?</p>
<p>Admiral Rioxover. Yes; “t was explored. The basic reason, as T understand it, is that as far as Duquesne is concerned, Shippingport is a standby plant. Duquesne has about 1,200,000 kilowatts of in- stalled capacity. What they get out of the Shippingport plant is a sinall part of the total.</p>
<p>Representative Honirietp. So the investment of $23 million for an muetruptible supply from their standpoint would not be economic, particularly in the view that it is interruptible?</p>
<p>Admiral] Rickover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hotrrimip. Would the heat sink arrangement which is going to cost—is it $9 million ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. $4 million ora little less, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Honirieiy. Will that give you the sane ability to ob-</p>
<p>tain operational data on your reactor as if it were attached /</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. It will be completely equivalent. In fact, it will be even better because we will not be tied into an outside demand for power. We can just use the heat sink as we wish. There is no reduction in our ability to obtain data. In fact, it will be enhanced.</p>
<p>Representative Horirrecp. Because you can interrupt it at will and have no obligation at all for furnishing in-line power?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is correct, sir.</p>

<p>Senator Dworsiak. Could I ask a brief question ?</p>
<p>‘Last. year we gave you $18.5 million for the natural circulation plant. What progress has been made in that ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We expect to start construction at Idaho by the end of this fiscal year.</p>
<p>Senator DworsHax. Whois going to do the work ?</p>
<p>_ Admiral Riokover. We do not know that yet, sir. Of course, our contract is with the General Electric Co. But it is our intention, as Mr. McCone has told you previously, to locate it in Idaho.</p>
<p>Senator Dworsnax. There is no possibility that it will be sent 'to some eastern plant because GE has the contract?</p>
<p>' Admiral Rickover. No, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Dworsnax. You are determined to do the work as the Con- gress originally directed that it be done @</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Yes, sir. You have that assurance from the Chairman of the Commission.</p>
<p>Senator Dworsiax. Thank you.</p>
<p>Representative Houtrreip. I wanted to ask you about one item which I noticed was asked for, “Reactor modification to enable the prototype plant,” for $5.6 million. This was denied by the Bureau of the Budget.</p>
<p>The item is for reactor modification to naval prototype plants, $5.6 million. Are you acquainted with that?</p>
<p>Mr. Lurpecke. Yes, sir. This item was not submitted to the Bu- reaul as a construction project; it was included in our estimates for the “Operating expenses” appropriation in the amount of costs an- ticipated in fiscal year 1961.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes; that is not an y problem for us.</p>
<p>May I say one more thing about the Shippingport reactor? I hope we get authority or at Jeast an understanding that the committee looks favorably or unfavorably ou it because we have to go ahead with architect engineering. We have certain funds which we could legally use to get started.</p>
<p>Representative Horirreip. I think I would be out of place to make any kind of a firm commitment, but I believe I ean express the general feeling of the committee that, they want you to go ahead with this operation at Shippingport, which would indicate approval of this by the committee. That will have to be taken into consideration by the committee as a whole.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovmr. Yes, sir; I understand that thoroughly.</p>
<p>cnn ai pe tn aman ain</p>
<p>Representative Howirieiy. The authorization bill, I might say, should be out by about mid-April. We have 2 more days of learing, and in the early part of April we will wait for some reports. As soon as those reports come in, we should get it out. It will be considered on the floor shortly thereafter, and then, of course, it will go to the Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Houirieip. Before we adjourn, I will announce that there will be an executive session of the committee in F-88 today,</p>
<p>and then there will be an open meeting in this same room tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock.</p>

<p>Dh es, I strougly recommend that your legislation subcommittee take steps to assure</p>
<p>that authorization for nuclear reactor plants at our Antarctic bases be included ‘ in the Atomic Energy Commission's next authorization bill.</p>
<p>fo) : I think it is very important to proceed with such a project without delay. I</p>
<p>i believe we should consider suggesting to the ARC and the Navy that design work</p>

<p>Considering the high cost of conventional fuels in the Antaretie, it appears that a significant economic advantage exists for the nse of nuclear reactors at our bases in the Antarctic. In fac</p>
