      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document commemorates the presentation of the 1964 Enrico Fermi Award to VADM H.G. Rickover by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 14, 1965, alongside a news article detailing the recognition. The central theme celebrates Rickover&#x27;s &quot;engineering and administrative leadership in the development of safe and reliable nuclear power and its successful application to national security and economic needs.&quot; Notable facts include his pivotal role in creating the U.S. nuclear navy, which by 1965 boasted over 50 vessels (specifically 22 attack submarines, 29 Polaris submarines, and 3 surface ships) that had traveled over 4.3 million miles. The document also credits him with the 1957 establishment of the first large nuclear generating station at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, and forecasts future peaceful applications like nuclear-powered merchant ships and desalting the sea, projecting 70 million kilowatts from nuclear power by 1980. Rickover, the first engineer-administrator to receive the $25,000 award, is lauded for his unwavering dedication and leadership, which significantly advanced national security and economic growth.</p>

<p>REMARKS BY PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON<br>UPON PRESENTATION OF ENRICO FERMI AWARD FOR 1964<br>TO VADM H. G. RICKOVER, USN<br>THE WHITE HOUSE</p>
<p>JANUARY 14, 1965</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, it is a gratifying pleasure to participate in this ceremony</p>
<p>recognizing your contributions to our Nation&#x27;s security--and to our peaceful economic</p>
<p>growth in the future.<br>The citation of this eighth Enrico Fermi Award states:<br>&quot;For engineering and administrative leadership in the development<br>of safe and reliable nuclear power and its successful application</p>
<p>to our national security and economic needs.&quot;<br>In just three days, we shall be celebrating the tenth anniversary of the first</p>
<p>sea voyage of a nuclear-powered submarine--the Nautilus. The Nation is grateful for</p>
<p>your courageous and dedicated role in that historic development.<br>Over the ten‘ years since, the Nautilus has been joined by more than 50 other</p>
<p>nuclear-powered naval vessels. Today our nuclear fleet numbers 22 attack submarines,</p>
<p>29 Polaris submarines, and 3 surface ships. Together these nuclear-powered vessels</p>
<p>have traveled a total of more than 4,300,000 miles on patrol for peace and freedom.<br>Your personal leadership has made an invaluable contribution to our national<br>security--and to our capacity for keeping the peace.<br>Your personal dedication to excellence--your personal faith in the future--offer</p>
<p>examples which this nation must emulate if we are to fulfill the potential that is</p>
<p>ours »</p>
<p>In no field is the promise--and the challenge--more exciting than the peaceful</p>
<p>potential of nuclear power.</p>
<p>&gt;) ~</p>
<p>Beyond the present naval applications, perhaps there may be much broader horizons<br>for nuclear power on the high seas. I hope the day will come when nuclear power will<br>be so economical for our merchant ships that the American Maritime Fleet will once<br>again become preeminent--with a new generation of swift longrange nuclear-powered<br>vessels.</p>
<p>You were instrumental in the construction of the world&#x27;s first large nuclear<br>generating station at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, in 1957. From that beginning, we<br>are now able to foresee the day~-only 15 years away~-when we shall have some 70 million<br>kilowatts of installed capacity from nuclear power generation stations.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when this great energy resource can be applied to<br>desalting the sea, assuring us the additional fresh water needed for our growing<br>population and expanding industries. In these important years you have played a role<br>of first importance in helping us to understand and use more rationally the great</p>
<p>foree of nuclear energy. It is often overlooked that your many accomplishments and</p>
<p>contributions have been made while in the service of your Government. Your<br>achievements and your career should stand as an example to the many present and<br>future Government personnel that there is a large job that can be done-~and that a<br>job well done is recognized,</p>
<p>For these significant contributions to our national security and evonth, I am<br>privileged to present to you--on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission and the people</p>
<p>of the United States--the Enrico Fermi Award for 1964.</p>
<p>Rickover Gets Fermi Award |<br>For Role in Buildin</p>
<p>By the Associated Press</p>
<p>Vice Adm. Hyman G. Rick-<br>over was selected yesterday as<br>recipient of the 1964 Enrico<br>Fermi Award for his contribu-<br>tions to the development of nu-<br>clear power for submarines and<br>power generating plants.</p>
<p>Rickover is the first engineer-<br>administrator to win the Atomic<br>Energy<br>which carries with it a $25,000<br>prize, as well as a gold medal.</p>
<p>The award was established in<br>1954 and was first given to En-<br>rico Fermi, leader of the scien-<br>tifie team that achieved the first<br>sustained, controlled nuclear<br>cnain reaction in 1942. At one<br>time the cash award was $50,-<br>000.</p>
<p>Revolution in Strategy</p>
<p>Rickover was eredited by the<br>AEC with launching a revolu-<br>tion in naval strategy and. tac-<br>tics by his successful develop-<br>ment of a nuclear propulsion<br>plant for submarines. The first<br>one, the Nautilus, which went<br>| to sea in 1953, was the fore-<br>runner of the mighty Polaris-<br>missile submarine fleet that is<br>now a bulwark of the nation’s<br>defense system.</p>
<p>In honoring the 64-year-old ad-<br>‘miral, the AEC also cited his<br>work in developing a nuclear<br>reactor to generate electricity</p>
<p>at Shippingport, Pa., which has’</p>
<p>Commission’s award,</p>
<p>ADM. HY. RICKOVER</p>
<p>supplied users of electricity in<br>the Pittsburgh area since 1957.</p>
<p>The Shippingport plant also<br>has been a valuable research<br>tool, leading to many design im-<br>provements in power reactors<br>and fuel materials, the AEC<br>said.</p>
<p>‘Deeply Honored”</p>
<p>Rickover told a reporter he<br>was ‘“‘deeply honored,” by the<br>award.” He added in a state<br>ment:<br>“¥ was privileged to know En-</p>
<p>g A-Subs</p>
<p>rico Fermi and admired him<br>not only as a scientist but also</p>
<p>“as a warm-hearted human be-</p>
<p>ing. For, this reason alone, if<br>for no other, it is a privilege to<br>have been associated with so<br>great a man.</p>
<p>“This award truly belongs to<br>all the dedicated men and wom-<br>en in the laboratories, the fac-<br>tories and in the shipyards who<br>have worked so long and hard to<br>develop our nuclear Navy.</p>
<p>“That we now have 51 atomic<br>submarines in operation and 41<br>more authorized by Congress,<br>together with the nuclear-pow-<br>ered carrier Enterprise, the<br>cruiser Long Beach and the<br>frigate Bainbridge, is tribute to<br>them.</p>
<p>Leadership Cited</p>
<p>“T am also deeply grateful for|</p>
<p>the support I have invariably<br>received from the Atomic En-<br>ergy Commission and from Con-<br>gress. Without their active sup-<br>port and constant help we would<br>not now have our nuclear<br>Navy.”</p>
<p>The citation for Rickover says<br>his selection for the award is:<br>the development of safe and<br>reliable nuclear power and its<br>successful application to our<br>national security and economic<br>needs.”</p>
<p>Previous winners of the award</p>
<p>sHastet Tashan</p>
<p>were notable for their scientific,<br>rather than their engineering<br>achievements. Following Fermi,<br>they were:</p>
<p>John von<br>and mathematician; Ernest O.<br>Lawrence, inventor of the cyclo-<br>tron; Eugene Wigner, profes-<br>sor of mathematical physics at’<br>Princeton University; Glenn T.<br>Seaborg, discoverer of pluto-<br>nium and present chairman of</p>
<p>the AEC; Hans A. Bethe, pro-|:</p>
<p>fessor of physics at Cornell Uni-<br>versity; Edward Teller, for his<br>work in thermonuclear research,<br>and J. Robert Oppenheimer,<br>head of the team that produced<br>the first atomic bomb at Los<br>Alamos, N. M</p>
<p>Rickover, who was graduated<br>from the Naval Academy in<br>1922, turned his attention to nu-<br>clear ship propulsion after<br>World War Il and in 1946 was<br>assigned to the atomic subma-<br>rine project as assistant director<br>of operations. Since 1947 he has<br>served as manager of naval re-<br>actors for the AEC as assistant<br>chief for nuclear propulsion in<br>the Navy.</p>
