      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this excerpt from his 1962 address, VADM H. G. Rickover issues a stark warning about the &quot;never-ending challenge&quot; of progress, emphasizing that it demands higher standards and an end to outdated practices. He sharply criticizes conventional industry for its pervasive failure to meet the exacting quality requirements of new technologies, particularly nuclear reactor components, despite significant public investment (noting that nearly $12 billion of $16 billion in R&amp;D comes from taxpayer&#x27;s pockets). Rickover details widespread quality control issues in welding, casting, and radiography, citing alarming statistics such as only 10% of 99 carbon steel welds meeting ASME standards and a manufacturer&#x27;s 47% rejection rate for shop welds. He recounts a critical incident where a wrongly-specified stainless steel fitting was installed in a nuclear submarine, leading to a fleet-wide check that uncovered 12 such errors. These failures, Rickover asserts, result in staggering costs, delays, and grave safety risks, stressing that management&#x27;s reluctance to abandon inadequate practices undermines national security and competitiveness, referencing Robert Hutchins&#x27; warning that &quot;an uncriticized society will not endure.&quot;</p>

        <p>THE NEVER-ENDING CHALLENGE<br>by<br>VADM H. G. Rickover, USN<br>Excerpts From Address<br>Given at the ~<br>Forty-Fourth Annual<br>National Metal Congress<br>New York, New York<br>Monday, October 29, 1962<br>Progress--like freedom--is desired by nearly all men, but not<br>all understand that both come at a cost. Whenever society advances--<br>be it in culture and education or science and technology--there is a<br>1 rise in the requirements that must be met in all fields of human<br>| endeavor. The price of progress is acceptance of these more exacting<br>standards of performance and relinquishment of familiar habits and<br>conventions rendered obsolete because they no longer meet the new<br>standards. |<br>My remarks today concern the harmful results that follow when<br>industry fails to live up to the exacting standards of a new science--<br>reactor technology. We depend on private industry to supply the<br>materials and equipments for our nuclear power plants. Current<br>industrial practices are, on the whole, not geared to the standards<br>imposed by this new technology.<br>While it has not been too difficult to focus management attention<br>on the nuclear reactor itself, which represents a novel development,<br>it has been extremely difficult to get management to give effective</p>
<p>attention to the conventional components of these plants. Routine</p>
<p>manufacturing and engineering practices continue to be followed, even</p>
<p>though experience has shown these practices to be inadequate.</p>
<p>Successful operation of a nuclear power plant depends on the<br>eliability of all its parts, the reactor as well as the conventional<br>eomponents--the heat exchangers, pressure vessels, valves, turbo-generators,<br>etc. Although these are all designed and manufactured by long established<br>procedures and so should present no special difficulty, delivery and<br>oerformance of these conventional items have been less reliable than<br>of the nuclear reactors themselves. Compared with the complexity of<br>nuclear engineering itself these problems individually are minor in<br>nature, yet they occur so frequently as to require a disproportionate<br>amount of our time. If we are to build successful nuclear power plants<br>at reasonable cost and in reasonable time, the whole plateau of industrial<br>workmanship, engineering inspection, and quality control must be raised<br>well above the present level. This is the responsibility of management.<br>Management&#x27;s technical function, after all, is to see to it that production<br>meets the customer&#x27;s requirements. |</p>
<p>When management fails to do so the benefits our nation obtains from<br>huge investments in research and development are reduced. Of an annual<br>total of about $16 billion, nearly $12 billion come out of the taxpayer&#x27;s<br>pocket. The size of these expenditures places a great responsibility<br>on industry. It must get people into management who have the competence<br>to make certain that stockholders and taxpayers receive full value for<br>the money invested in new technology, and that the nation&#x27;s technical<br>resources are effectively used. Yet, time and again I have found that<br>management is reluctant to depart from outdated practices; that it is</p>
<p>not informed of what is actually going on in the plant; that it fails to</p>

<p>application will have serious consequences 4n a nuclear plant pecause<br>nere radioactivity is involved. Even in the non-nuclear parts of cur<br>clants we must have full reliability if the great endurance of nuclear<br>cower 15 so be realized.</p>
<p>+ should like to discuss two areas shat are in need of continuovs</p>
<p>and painstaking attention to detail by management, by engineers, and DY</p>
<p>ron</p>
<p>&quot;OPKMEN « These are: incomplete understanding cf basic manufacturing an<br>snspection processes» and poor workmanship and pocr quality control.</p>
<p>Let me give you specific examples:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Tnes of pasic manufacturing ano. inspection</p>
<p>processes. when we design components for nuclear power plants we mae</p>
<p>every effort to urcvilize existing processes. At first we assumed. pasic</p>
<p>orocesses tnat have peen in widespread industrial use for many year s would</p>
<p>es<br>be well understood. our experience showed this yas not SO- tere 1S en<br>examole of the type of qifficulties we constantly encounter.</p>
<p>mhere are 99 carbon steel welds in one particular nuclear olant<br>steam system. The manufacturer stated that all these welds were<br>radiographed and met specifications. our own re-evaluation of these</p>
<p>welds--uUsing correct procedures and proper X-ray sensiti svity--showed</p>
<p>however that only ten percent met ASME standards 5 35 cercent nea cerects</p>
<p>aPinitely in excess of ASME standards and the remaining 55 percent had<br>such 2 rough external surface that the radiographs obtained could not be<br>snterpreted with any degree of assurance. We found this condition of<br>unsatisfactory welds and improper radiography to be quite prevalent in<br>many segments of industry. When we insisted that manufacturers meet the<br>standards which had been established for many years as peing necessary,<br>very high re jection rates for welds resulted. one manufacturer, over<br>a three month period, had to reject 4u7 percent of all carbon steel welds<br>made in his shop; his re jection rate for welds made in the field, where<br>conditions were less favorable, was even higher. In other types of welds<br>a manufacturer nad 85 to 100 percent rejection rates. I would like to</p>
<p>emphasize that this unsatisfactory welding situation came to light only</p>
<p>— because we demanded that manufacturers prove to us they were meetin</p>
<p>the standards which they themselves had accepted in the contract.</p>
<p>Casting is another basic process that is not fully understood. We</p>
<p>often have to order two to three times as many castings as we need, because</p>
<p>we have so much trouble obtaining satisfactory ones. Otherwise we may not</p>
<p>1 have enough acceptable castings on time. When we do receive acceptable</p>
<p>ii castings, this 4s only after 200 to 300 wela repairs have peen made on<br>each casting. Although this sort of difficulty has existed for many years,<br>industry has not yet developed adequate techniques for successfully</p>
<p>| producing large castings.</p>
<p>| Radiography is another basic process of contemporary conventional</p>
<p>at technology where we are constantly troubled with problems. Extensive use</p>
<p>of radiography for over 30 years led us to believe that this nondestructive</p>
<p>a-tne sechnioue for determining soundness of welds and castings was well<br>—@erscocad, and that the sensitivity requirements of existing ASME and</p>
<p>Sevy scecifications were peing met. We found this definitely not to be so.<br>Por years many of these requirements have been consistently violated. In<br>consecuence, large numbers of radiographs were of little or no value for<br>desermining integrity of welds and castings.</p>
<p>Besides this unsatisfactory situation in welding, casting and<br>radiograovhy;, oractical application of nuclear power is also hampered by<br>unresolved problems of fatigue in materials.</p>
<p>Present knowledge of material fatigue under thermal cycling stress is<br>meager. In consequence, we in the reactor group have had to develop special<br>test loops to conduct tests for determining the adequacy of conventional<br>components. Based on results of these tests we have had to change the<br>design of many eouipments--valves, nozzles, thermal sleeves--all of which }<br>nave been in use by industry for many years. Yet fatigue is not peculiar</p>
<p>so nuclear prooulsion; nor 4s it a new problem for industry. The Civil</p>
<p>Aeronautics Board reports that every year several commercial airplane<br>accidents are caused by fatigue failure of propellers, landing gear, or<br>hydraulic oressure lines. Reporting on a recent helicopter accident caused<br>by fatigue eracking of a main rotor blade, the CAB warned that there was<br>urgent need for petter understanding of safe fatigue life of materials and<br>for more conservative design.</p>
<p>2. Poor workmanship and poor quality control. Modern technology--in</p>
<p>nuclear power, in high speed aeronautics, or in high performance’ computers-~-</p>
<p>requires greater excellence in workmanship and in quality control than has</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Jom necessary in the past, and this even in the conventional components<br>meed im these advanced systems. This is particularly true for nuciear<br>sechnology where hazards of radioactivity and difficulty of access for</p>
<p>maintenance ana repair require workmanship and quality control to be at a<br>much higher level than in normal industrial applications. Tn the case<br>of submarines, moreover, the crew lives and works petween two dangerous<br>environments--the intense sea pressure outside the hull of the ship, and<br>she hot, high pressure primary and secondary systems of the propulsion<br>plant. If the poundaries of either of these pressure containments<br>should fail, serious consequences would result. The reason why I<br>emphasize and insist on design excellence and nigh quality workmanship is<br>that our nuclear submarines have to operate submerged for long periods of<br>time, even under the polar ice cap where 4% may not pe possible to come to<br>the surface. |</p>
<p>Recently we discovered that a stainless steel fitting had been welded<br>into a nickel-copper alloy piping system, ‘The fitting had been certified<br>by the manufacturer as nickel-copper » ana nad all the required<br>certification data including chemistry and inspection results. in fact<br>the words &quot;nickel-copper&quot; were actually etched in the fitting. Yet it was<br>the wrong material! The system was antended for sea water service; nad it<br>been placed in operation with this stainless steel fitting 2 serious<br>casualty would have resulted. In checking with other customers of this<br>manufacturer We found that they too nad received fittings of the wrong<br>material. The manufacturer simply had no effective quality control</p>
<p>organization. As a result we now have to check every fitting ever supplied</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>mis manufacturer. The check is only partially completed, but jo fittings<br>£ smeorrect material have already been discovered.<br>feel rather strongly about this problem. Qn more than one occasion<br>T have been in a deeply submerged submarine when a failure occurred in a<br>ses water system pecause a fitting was of the wrong material. But for the<br>oroapt action of the crew, the consequences would have peen disastrous.<br>Poor workmanship shows up glaringly in new technology such as<br>nuclear power, missiles, satellites, but 4t is to be found everywhere;</p>
<p>and everywhere it raises cost and causes delay. I assure you I am not</p>
<p>m<br>©</p>
<p>exaggerating the situation; in fact, I have understated it. For every cai<br>I nave given, I could cite a dozen more. The cost tn time and money<br>pecause of tnaustry&#x27;s failure to meet contractual specifications is<br>staggering. worse, with this time and with this money we could nave<br>develoved imoroved nuclear power plants and produced many more of them. 1%<br>ts a@ifficult for me to understand why management does not face up to its<br>failure and its responsibility in this respect. Since contracts are sought<br>for, they must be profitable. Despite talk of &quot;the dead hand of government ,&quot;<br>4% ts oublic money that has paid for all major technological advances mace<br>tn the vast two decades; and public agencies and officials have taken «he<br>jead in getting most developments startea. Surely industry has as great<br>a stake as every citizen in helping our nation move forward technologically.<br>Tndustry can best do this by meeting the rising standards of new<br>sechnologies when 4t supplies material and equipment.</p>
<p>I hope what I have said will not be dismissed as &quot;unconstructive</p>
<p>eriticism or cetulant grumbling about difficulties that “ought to be</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>foected.” Robert Hutchins nas warned that “an uncriticized society</p>
<p>mind mot endure.&quot; The point 1 want to make is that, at the levels of</p>
<p>a aL</p>
<p>snnolosy te which we must rise, the kind of problems we in the Naval</p>
<p>“7<br>i</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>eters Group have had with conventional components of nuclear plants</p>
<p>0<br>ro)</p>
<p>il</p>
<p>ought not to be &quot;expected.&quot; They reveal human inadequacies that must<br>ne overcome if this nation is to be competitive with i4¢s Russian<br>ehailenger and with the growing power of the European Common Market.<br>For the first csime in our history we face competition without<br>penefit of the special advantages we enjoyed in the past: geographic<br>4solation; enormously greater per capita wealth in land and mineral<br>resources; the largest internal market. From now on we must excel</p>
<p>without these advantages. Population growth and rapid exhaustion of</p>
<p>natural resources leave us in no petter position than Russia $ and 4<br>united Europe will soon have as large a domestic market aS WE; pesides<br>possessing great resources in human eompetence and ingenuity. In<br>truth, che inefficiencies we could afford in days gone py may now</p>
<p>seriously endanger our world position.</p>
<p>ae</p>
<p>What I have spied today is to give you an ankling of the factors<br>that hinder progress in reactor technology and in other new engineering<br>development projects as well. It is a commonplace of history chat great<br>undertakings often founder pecause of negligence in some small detail,</p>
<p>or pecause of some minor, obvious and easily corrected mistake .»</p>
<p>T gubmit we must progress, and so we must vay che price of progress.</p>
<p>we must accept the inexorably rising standards of sechnology and we must<br>relinquish comfortable routines and practices rendered obsolete because</p>
<p>shey no longer meet the new standards.</p>
<p>This is our never-ending challence.</p>
