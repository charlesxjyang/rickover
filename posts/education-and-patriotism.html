      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a speech delivered upon receiving the Gold Good Citizen Medal from the Sons of the American Revolution on April 30, 1966, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover champions the critical need for &quot;political education&quot; in American public schools to foster democratic citizenship. He argues that democracy&#x27;s success relies uniquely on every citizen&#x27;s deep comprehension and valuation of freedom, necessitating a rigorous, sequential curriculum in history, government, geography, and literature from elementary grades. Rickover briefly outlines his demanding work with the Naval Reactors program, highlighting a formidable nuclear fleet comprising 60 submarines, 1 destroyer, 1 cruiser, and 1 aircraft carrier, with 41 additional nuclear ships under construction, underscoring a commitment to superior design, construction, and the development of exceptionally competent personnel.</p>

<p>THIS SPEECH REFLECTS THE VIEWS OF THE FOR RELEASE 8:00 P.M,<br>AUTHOR AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT SATURDAY, APRIL 30, 1966<br>THE VIEWS OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY</p>
<p>OR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY</p>
<p>EDUCATION AND PATRIOTISM rn GEARED</p>
<p>by fi<br>Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Naty. Fl<br>- upon accepting 2, &amp; MAR 1966 11<br>GOLD GOOD CITIZEN MEDAL DIRECTORATE FOR Stuurity<br>“sw DEPARTMENT</p>
<p>from ~ OF DEFENS@AS&gt;PA<br>Sons of the American Revolution<br>West Point, New York<br>Saturday, April 30, 1966<br>I deeply appreciate the honor you have bestowed upon me by your award<br>of the Gold Good Citizen Medal. It is a great pleasure to be with you<br>tonight. I regret I have been unable to find time to prepare a speech that<br>would do justice to this distinguished audience, My increasingly heavy<br>work schedule in the Navy&#x27;s nuclear propulsion program, for which I am<br>responsible, restricts to a minimum my outside activities. We now have a<br>nuclear fleet composed of sixty submarines, a nuclear destroyer, a cruiser<br>and an aircraft carrier. In addition, we have under construction thirty-<br>eight submarines, two destroyers and a small submarine capable of exploring</p>
<p>the ocean bottom. It is our purpose in the Naval Reactors Group to try</p>
<p>constantly to improve design and construction of new ships which means, of</p>
<p>course, that a great deal more work must be done than if these ships were<br>assembly line products. Also, they must be manned by exceptionally<br>competent officers and men, whose selection and training takes up a large<br>part of my time. |</p>
<p>When I received your kind invitation, I therefore tried to find a<br>subject with which I am familiar enough to present to you some informal<br>Copyright 1966, H. @. Rickover “</p>

<p>remarks that might perhaps be of interest. It occurred to me that, since<br>you are a patriotic society and I have long been deeply concerned with<br>better education for our children, I might speak about the need for better<br>political education in our public school system. By political education I<br>mean preparation for democratic citizenship.</p>
<p>Democracy is the most difficult of all political systems because it<br>will not function well unless ordinary men and women assume the kind of<br>political responsibility, and acquire the kind of political competence that<br>in monarchies and aristocracies is expected only of a single ruler or of a<br>ruling class. No political system functions well unless those destined to<br>rule are carefully educated for rulership; unless they acquire the mental<br>capacity to exercise the power of government; unless they develop a sense<br>of personal identification with the country, so they will know in their<br>bones that the common good is part of their own well-being. It always and<br>everywhere has been more difficult to educate the people as a whole for |<br>rulership than to educate one man or one class. But upon our ability to<br>develop these rulership qualities in the ordinary citizen depends the |<br>success of our system of government.</p>
<p>First among the qualities we must seek to nurture in our boys and<br>girls I would put comprehension of the meaning and value of democracy.</p>
<p>“Those who grow up in a free society need to be made intellectually aware</p>
<p>of what freedom means, how hard to win and easy to lose, how rare and &gt;<br>precious it is. There is no other way to bring about this awareness than<br>through a carefully planned sequential course of studies in such basic--<br>and for many children difficult--subjects as history, government, geography</p>
<p>and literature, a course beginning in the elementary grades and continuing</p>
