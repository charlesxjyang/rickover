      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a July 15, 1970 address to the SOS and Chowder and Marching Study Groups, Admiral Rickover, identifying as an &quot;amateur historian,&quot; offers insights into American political parties by drawing parallels between the 1970s and historical realignments, specifically Washington&#x27;s first administration and the 1850s. He posits that a party&#x27;s enduring success hinges on its ability to align with the core beliefs and frustrations of a stable &quot;middle American&quot; majority, rather than relying on coalitions of minorities. Rickover illustrates this through the failures of the Federalists and Whigs, contrasting them with the successes of Jefferson and Madison&#x27;s Republicans and later Lincoln&#x27;s Republican Party, which championed &quot;free labor&quot; and the &quot;Protestant Ethic.&quot; He advises that, like the 1860 Republicans who appealed to self-reliant, hardworking citizens, today&#x27;s party should represent the &quot;middle segment&quot; that values law and order, quality education, individual responsibility, and fair taxation, while advocating for reforms like public campaign financing. Rickover also references Carl Becker and Carl Schurz.</p>

        <p>Remarks before the<br>SOS and the Chowder and Marching Study Groups<br>Washington, D. C.<br>July 15, 1970</p>
<p>il 5</p>
<p>I am no historian, but American history -- history in general--has fascinated<br>me all my life. Despite a heavy work schedule, I have managed to turn myself<br>into a fairly knowledgeable amateur. In any event, I find that current issues<br>are Clarified for me by looking at them in the light of history. I am struck with<br>the similarity of the present to the past, not with its differences as so many<br>others see it, especially the young who have learned very little history in our<br>school system and think the past is not &quot;relevant.&quot; Observing history being<br>made all around me, and reading how it was made in the past, has led me to<br>certain convictions about the American party system. Whether they could be of<br>practical help, I cannot judge. But here they are.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that no party has an assured and long future unless it<br>establishes:‘a convincing, clearly stated connection with the troubles and<br>frustrations, as well as the aims and aspirations, and basic beliefs of a<br>relatively stable majority of the American people. To sense the formation of<br>a new majority is the secret of the successful party. To sense the erosion of<br>an existing majority and profit thereby is part of that secret. I would judge we</p>
<p>are currently in a situation somewhat resembling both the period at the end</p>
<p>of Washington&#x27;s first administration and during the 1850&#x27;s.</p>
<p>The Federalists who were chiefly responsible for the creation of our<br>Federal Union and who organized the central government under Washington<br>and Hamilton, failed to convince a majority of the people that their policies--<br>by enhancing the strength of the Nation politically and economically--were in<br>fact directly beneficial to them as individuals.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of Americans at that time were self-sufficient<br>farmers producing little beyond the needs of their families and perhaps a local<br>market, or they had small shops or were artisans or fishermen. It was not<br>immediately evident to them how they could personally profit from Federalist<br>efforts to build a strong national economy, to secure the credit of the Nation,<br>and to provide a stable currency. It was therefore extremely easy for<br>Jefferson and Madison to win a majority for their new anti-Federalist party--<br>then called the Republican Party, as you all know--by accusing the opponents<br>of &quot;monarchical&quot; or &quot;aristocratic&quot; tendencies, of being concerned only with the<br>rich and not with the ordinary citizen. On their famous &quot;botanizing&quot; expedition<br>to New York in 1791, Jefferson and Madison forged a coalition of southern<br>planters, western farmers and the poorer segments of northern city people which<br>proved extraordinarily durable. Defeating the Federalists in 1800, the<br>Jeffersonian Republicans controlled the Federal Government for almost three<br>decades, ruling with virtually no national opposition.</p>
<p>The party held together until 1828, when its larger part formed a new coalition<br>of farmers and mechanics under Jackson who called it the &quot;Democracy.&quot; Clay</p>
<p>rallied the dissident remnants in a new party, the Whigs, whose appeal was more</p>
<p>broadly based than that of the Federalists but whose policies were essentially</p>
<p>Hamilton&#x27;s brought up-to-date. The Whigs wanted to build a large domestic<br>market which would make the country economically independent--tariffs to<br>promote domestic industry, federally aided internal improvements to facilitate<br>overland transport, sound money and a national bank. They, too, failed to<br>convince a stable majority that these were policies benefiting them. Jackson<br>had no difficulty making a case against the Whigs on the grounds of allegedly<br>favoring the rich, the “eastern money&quot; power. Winning occasional victories,<br>the Whigs never held power long enough to carry out their economic program.<br>The seesaw between them and the Democrats down to the Civil War was not<br>unlike the situation we have had since the early 1930&#x27;s.</p>
<p>Yet the very policies espoused first by the Federalists, then by the Whigs,<br>formed a major part of the platform on which the newly formed Republican Party<br>rode to victory with Lincoln in 1860, and maintained itself in power for half a<br>century thereafter.</p>
<p>I am no expert in political matters; indeed I have no business talking to<br>experts like yourselves on these matters. But if I were concerned with trying<br>to build up your party nationally so that we should have a close equilibrium, with<br>power shifting frequently between the two great parties--more frequently and more<br>completely than in the past 40 years--if this were my job, I should study very<br>carefully how the Republicans of 1860 managed to convince the majority that<br>theirs was a &quot;popular,&quot; not an &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;aristocratic&quot; or &quot;rich man&#x27;s&quot; party.<br>I suspect it was because they sensed that a large majority in the North were</p>
<p>tired of government by a coalition of minorities. I think it may well be that</p>
<p>something like this is taking place today. Superficially, everything seems</p>
<p>different--today&#x27;s Americans are different people, the divisive issues are<br>not sectional. But I would guess, that, as of 1860, a majority is in process<br>of formation which does not feel itself fully represented by either of today&#x27;s<br>two parties.</p>
<p>It is generally thought that our political system functions best when both<br>parties share a large body of similar beliefs and objectives. As Carl Becker<br>said, government by majority performs most successfully when political issues<br>do not tou ~ - deep social and economic divisions. The reason of course is<br>that the minority then finds it relatively easy to accept defeat at the polls--</p>
<p>a lost election does not mean &quot;a fatal surrender of vital interests.&quot; This is<br>true enough in normal times, but not when there is a deep rift in the body<br>politic. Such a rift cannot be bridged unless the parties accurately reflect the<br>opposing views so that conflicts may be settled by majority decision instead</p>
<p>of being allowed to linger on, imperfectly resolved by negotiated compromises--<br>as was the case during the three decades preceding the Civil War.</p>
<p>Slavery--with all its political, economic and social ramifications--was, of<br>course, the cause of the rift, of the growing alienation between North and South.<br>Yet neither of the two parties took a clear-cut stand on this issue; both evaded<br>it in order to remain &quot;national&quot; parties. Third parties were formed, but they<br>were insignificant and short-lived, none offering a program broad enough to<br>appeal to the majority of &quot;middle&quot; Americans. None, that is, until the advent</p>
<p>of the Republicans.</p>
<p>Combining as it did the economic policies of the Whigs with a promise of<br>homestead legislation (steadfastly voted down by the southern-controlled<br>Democrats) and with a straightforward ban on further extension of slavery into<br>the territories (an old Federalist objective), the 1860 platform of the Republican<br>Party represented the first commitment in years to the interests of a broad<br>segment of the population of the North where there were as yet few social or<br>economic differences and most enterprises were still owner operated. It<br>therefore appealed to independent mill owners, merchants and farmers, as much<br>as to those who w ~ ° for others but had ambitions to become independent--for<br>them the realization of these ambitions was tied to keeping slavery out of the<br>federal territories and making the land available to &quot;free labor&quot; as a safety<br>valve, should industrial conditions worsen, and as an ever present opportunity<br>for everyone willing to face the risk of pioneer life in order to achieve economic<br>independence.</p>
<p>Of those who abandoned old party affiliations and voted Republican in 1860--<br>and for many decades thereafter--few were rich. Indeed, as is true of most<br>&quot;middle&quot; Americans then and now, great wealth and the power it wields were<br>anathema to them. They disliked rich northern mill owners--the so-called<br>&quot;lords of the loom&quot;--as much as southern slave holding planters--the &quot;lords<br>of the lash.&quot; But what I believe they disliked more than anything else was the<br>coalition of these two which to them was personified in the Democratic Party--<br>then no longer Jackson&#x27;s party of the common man--no less then in the Whigs</p>
<p>who put up no strong opposition, being rendered ineffective by their desire to</p>
<p>hold on to their southern constituents. In contrast, the Republicans never</p>
<p>ceased denouncing the &quot;slave power&quot; and its control of the Executive, the<br>Senate, and the Supreme Court, especially the use by the southern minority<br>of the 5th Amendment--as in the Dred Scott case--to bolster their demand for<br>the extension and national protection of slavery. The party never tired of<br>glorifying the dignity of &quot;free labor,&quot; setting it against its debasement where-<br>ever slavery existed. Carl Schurz, endorsing Lincoln&#x27;s nomination in 1860,<br>summed it all up in the words: &quot;The Republicans stand before the country not<br>only as the antislavery party, but emphatically as the party of free labor.&quot;</p>
<p>The term &quot;free labor then applied to all who worked with their own hands<br>and brains to support themselves and their families. America was to them the<br>country of opportunity for the common man, the one country in the world where<br>he controlled his government. They were, if you will, a &quot;silent majority&quot;<br>become vociferous when they felt that a coalition of minorities above and below<br>&quot;middle&quot; America was perverting the Union of the Pounding Fathers. They<br>believed the society of the North exemplified the best in America, that of the<br>South the worst--a conviction confirmed in every major Republican campaign<br>speech. To them, the determination of the new party to capture the Federal<br>Government and thus end the minority rule of the &quot;slave power&quot; meant a return<br>to the cardinal principles of the American political system, the rule of the<br>majority.</p>
<p>It was this clear-cut commitment to a middle class society, composed of<br>self-reliant people coming up from the ranks of labor, none very rich, but</p>
<p>hardworking, with faith in education and what has come to be called the</p>
<p>&quot;Protestant Ethic&quot;--it was this that distinguished the Republicans of 1860 from<br>the Federalists and Whigs with whom they shared their whole economic philo-<br>sophy. Only when those favoring a strong nation, both economically and<br>politically, tied this Philosophy to the aims of &quot;middle&quot; Americans did they win</p>
<p>a stable and continuing majority. Noone since Lincoln--except perhaps</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt--succeeded SO well in convincing &quot;middle&quot; America that</p>
<p>One might dismiss this as ancient history, but I feel certain that without<br>emulating this identification of Purpose no dependable majority support can be<br>built. The pa =r most natural to the Republican Party is identification with<br>&quot;middle&quot; America. It Cannot be avowedly &quot;conservative&quot; for, in the context<br>of American political values, this would brand it as a party of the rich, Nor,<br>in my judgment, would it have a secure future if it left itself open to the<br>accuSation of disregarding the interests of &quot;middle&quot; Americans in favor of one<br>Or another or a combination of minorities. This would be to build on Sand--at<br>least in the long run, [ may be wrong, but I believe that a large and Stable<br>middle segment is evolving in our Society--not altogether unlike the constituency<br>of the Party in 1860 and for decades thereafter, the segment your Party<br>is inherently best equipped to represent.</p>
<p>Ranging through every economic level, it consists of People who are<br>competent in their own sphere of activity, hardworking, able to make their way<br>on their own. They pay most of the taxes yet receive Proportionately the least<br>benefit from them since, asa group, they are given few if any special Privileges--</p>
<p>no federal Subsidies for them for non-work or plain incompetence, no tax</p>
<p>write offs, no Government contracts yielding high profits--no handouts from</p>
<p>the Government. The issues which today loom large in the eyes of these</p>
<p>people involve no demands on their part for special benefits; they are issues<br>concerning all Americans who contribute to society and are fundamentally in<br>accord with our political system. Such as the need to devise new ways to<br>finance political campaigns out of public funds so that candidates need be<br>neither rich nor obligated to large campaign contributors. To bring about this<br>reform today would be as great a party achievement as was the ban on slavery in<br>the territories in 1860--then as now, effecting a return to the fundamental concept<br>of our political system; government chosen by and accountable to the people or,<br>more precisely, to the current majority of the people. Or take the long over-<br>due reform of our school system. What &quot;middle&quot; Americans want is good</p>
<p>education, not schooling that is used primarily for social experimentation..</p>
<p>They are for law and order in the sense that every civilized person wants it--even-<br>handed administration of justice with no privileged status for anyone; competent<br>and honest police; laws made by the representatives of the elected majority not<br>by self-righteous minorities. They are against the parasites of society whether<br>they be the very rich who escape taxation by gimmickry or the very poor who<br>demand, as they see it, too large a slice of their own hard earned income in<br>taxes.</p>
<p>I need not pursue this further, except to remark, in passing, that it is these<br>people who have contributed an outsize share of men to defend the nation in war.<br>To see the flag trampled and the United States derided, destroys the spiritual</p>
<p>basis of their lives, makes a mockery of their beliefs. I suspect that this</p>
<p>co?</p>
<p>education, in the law, even in the business world.</p>
<p>They are at heart all self-made or would-be self-made men; they sense the</p>
<p>unnaturalness of the PSeudo-psychosociologica] notion that man is but the</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know whether any of this might be useful to you, But this is what</p>
<p>Over the years [ have come to believe,</p>
