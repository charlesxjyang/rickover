Rickover&#x27;s &quot;Doing a Job&quot; speech, delivered at Columbia University in 1982, outlines a management philosophy sharply focused on individual accountability and direct, results-oriented leadership. As the &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy&quot; who oversaw feats like the rapid development of the Nautilus, Rickover argues that &quot;people, not organizations or management systems, get things done.&quot; He advocates for giving subordinates early responsibility and the freedom to &quot;own&quot; their work, rejects formal job descriptions, and criticizes bureaucratic tendencies like job rotation and shared responsibility that dilute accountability. Rickover emphasizes the critical importance of tenacious determination, meticulous attention to &quot;petty details,&quot; direct communication (with &quot;some forty key people&quot; reporting directly to him), and the courage to make objective, tough decisions—even &quot;killing his own child&quot; projects. Ultimately, he posits that these common-sense principles of hard work, personal ownership, and continuous effort far outweigh &quot;highly-touted modern management techniques.&quot;" data-year="1982" data-themes="Management,Leadership">

Key themes include the U.S.&#x27;s economic superiority as a powerful tool for leverage over military threats, and the nuanced relationships with Communist nations like the Soviet Union and China—with Nixon notably asserting China&#x27;s potential as the &quot;world power of the future&quot; and a &quot;trump card&quot; against Russia. He also shares opinions on the crucial role of the Shah of Iran for Mideast stability, the necessity of strong military capabilities coupled with combating inflation, the need for public support for civilian nuclear power, and his preference for a gasoline tax to fund military spending. Furthermore, Nixon touches on military information disclosure, efficiency within the Department of Defense (noting 60% of government personnel work there), and his opposition to televising congressional committee meetings." data-year="1980" data-themes="Government,Navy">

To counter this, Rickover outlines nine core principles derived from his 50 years of service: fostering a sense of &quot;Ownership&quot; and full &quot;Responsibility&quot; for one&#x27;s job; emphasizing &quot;Attention to Detail&quot;; setting clear &quot;Priorities&quot;; maintaining a thorough understanding of &quot;what is going on&quot; through diligent effort rather than &quot;management information systems&quot;; demonstrating &quot;Hard Work&quot;; ensuring quality through &quot;Checking up&quot; and &quot;Formality&quot; in communications; and courageously &quot;Facing the Facts,&quot; even when it means making difficult changes.

Key themes included Rickover&#x27;s candid criticisms of black leadership, citing interactions with Benjamin Hooks, Vernon Jordan, and Coretta King, and a discussion about Jesse Jackson. He also expressed concern over the &quot;vast power&quot; of Political Action Committees and lobbying&#x27;s influence on Congress, the fragmentation of the party system, and inefficiencies in government, advocating for radical elimination of &quot;useless jobs.&quot; On national security, Rickover pushed for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and discussed the Russian 40-knot submarine and issues like shipbuilding fraud. A notable section recounts Rickover&#x27;s unique interview process for the Navy&#x27;s nuclear program, including his decision to accept a black student with an unusually low SAT score (800) due to his work ethic, and his general views on media inaccuracies, Defense Department reorganization, and even historical figures like General Robert E.

Rickover&#x27;s &quot;Environmental Perspective&quot; speech, delivered in 1979, critically examines the public&#x27;s often-distorted perception of environmental risks, particularly regarding nuclear power and radiation, while advocating for a fact-based, balanced approach. Rickover expresses concern over the rapid consumption of finite natural resources, noting that oil consumption grew from one cubic mile in 1936 to 17 cubic miles (463 billion barrels) by 1979, and contrasts this with the exaggerated fear of radiation. He provides numerous figures to put risks into perspective, stating that the total gamma radioactivity discharged by over 100 naval nuclear ships into all harbors was less than two thousandths of a curie annually, and that nuclear power was estimated to contribute only 11 additional cancer deaths per year out of 360,000 total. He sharply criticizes the media for sensationalizing and distorting facts, and &quot;so-called experts&quot; for exploiting public fears, leading to frivolous injury claims, citing examples like $75,000 awarded for &quot;fear of radiation&quot; with no physical injury, and over $75 million awarded for alleged hearing loss in shipyards. Rickover urges professionals to convey facts with balance and perspective, emphasizing that the current &quot;crisis&quot; (Chinese: wei chi, dangerous opportunity) demands intelligent, not emotional, solutions to energy and environmental challenges." data-year="1979" data-themes="Energy,Environment">

G. Rickover delivers a scathing critique of the legal profession, asserting that its pursuit of money and power undermines justice, erodes public trust, and negatively impacts national defense. He argues that many lawyers prioritize their own interests, engaging in &quot;frivolous litigation, legal maneuvering, massive discovery campaigns, and delaying tactics&quot; that obfuscate issues rather than resolve disputes. Rickover substantiates his claims with striking examples, including a $500,000 overcharge case that took 15 years to reach trial, a $1 billion claim against the Navy comprising 64 volumes that diverted key personnel for years, and his own 40-hour deposition experience, all highlighting the cost and inefficiency of the system. He also criticizes patent lawyers for hindering competition and the American Bar Association (ABA) for acting as a &quot;protective association&quot; that fails to discipline members, citing instances of light punishments for serious misconduct and the &quot;revolving door&quot; phenomenon where former government lawyers litigate against their previous agencies. Rickover concludes by urging the legal community to address these issues by strengthening deterrents against false pleadings, establishing a forum that prioritizes professional responsibility over commercial gain, and actively policing their own, likening the task to cleansing the &quot;Augean Stables.&quot;" data-year="1979" data-themes="Society,Law">

G. Rickover delivers a scathing critique of the American public education system, arguing it has been &quot;perverted&quot; from its true purpose of intellectual development and critical thinking. He blames &quot;progressive ideas&quot; championed by John Dewey, the &quot;learning is fun&quot; movement, and the embrace of &quot;psychosocial treatment&quot; for leading to dramatically lowered standards. Rickover cites evidence such as a 13% drop in college board verbal scores, the failure of &quot;new math&quot; to teach fundamental arithmetic, and the academic inferiority and lack of accountability among many teachers (referencing James Koerner and Educational Testing Service data). He calls for &quot;massive reform,&quot; advocating a &quot;return to basics,&quot; professionalizing teaching by attracting &quot;competent, qualified teachers&quot; through merit-based compensation (drawing parallels to European models), and implementing national standards for accountability. Rickover concludes by urging citizens to take responsibility for redirecting schools away from being ineffective social programs and back towards their core educational mission, emphasizing that learning is work, not just fun, and that the opportunity for education is limited." data-year="1977" data-themes="Education">

G. Rickover, USN" data-summary="Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s 1975 address offers a profound critique and a bold vision for the future of American democracy, arguing that the nation must reassess its governmental machinery to avoid faltering amidst changing conditions. Rickover traces democracies from prehistoric tribes to ancient Athens (citing Plato&#x27;s ideal of 5,040 citizens), explaining how early American leaders like Hamilton, Jay, and Madison drew upon this history to form the Constitution. He contends that federal power has become over-centralized, shifting to the executive and judicial branches and creating a disconnect with citizens, particularly as the nation faces declining natural wealth, rising energy costs (highlighted by the 1952 Materials Policy Commission and 1973 oil embargo), and the influence of over 2.5 million commercial corporations compared to just six in 1787. To combat this, Rickover proposes a radical solution: drastically prune federal responsibilities, divide the U.S. into six or seven groups of states, each with broad autonomy over domestic matters like education and welfare, while confining the federal government primarily to military, foreign affairs, and foreign trade, all to be achieved via a Constitutional Convention demanding the highest form of statesmanship." data-year="1975" data-themes="Government">

Rickover details how line officers historically viewed engineers as inferior, leading to design flaws in battleships like the Oregon and the Kentucky-class, and operational deficiencies highlighted by the Bennington boiler explosion in 1905. He contrasts the Navy&#x27;s post-World War II shift towards &quot;management systems&quot; and bureaucratic layers (e.g., Secretary McNamara&#x27;s creation of the Naval Material Command, which grew to &quot;800 people&quot; and included &quot;65 admirals on CNO staff&quot; with little technical expertise) with the rigorous, hands-on engineering qualifications required for officers in the Nuclear Navy, which he personally oversees. Rickover laments that institutions like Annapolis and NROTC prioritize &quot;social science&quot; and &quot;management&quot; over essential technical training, even citing a midshipman studying &quot;rhythms of mice&quot; instead of engineering. He calls for a radical reform, including a return to a &quot;bilinear system&quot; where technical bureaus report directly to the Secretary, disbanding the Naval Material Command, and emphasizing that the Navy&#x27;s leadership must prioritize training and education for competence, rather than providing &quot;comfortable careers,&quot; to ensure its readiness." data-year="1974" data-themes="Navy,Engineering">

Rickover&#x27;s 1973 speech, &quot;Personal Accountability in Financial Management,&quot; offers a scathing critique of government inefficiency and a powerful call for individual responsibility. Drawing on over 50 years of public service, Rickover laments the prevalent apathy, excuses, and reluctance among officials to address systemic financial problems like cost overruns, waste, and lack of accountability, which he argues erode public confidence. He cites specific examples, including the decade-long struggle to establish Cost Accounting Standards (eventually championed by figures like Comptroller General Elmer Staats and Senators Patman, Gonzales, and Proxmire), the failure to approve 95% of the Department of Defense&#x27;s accounting systems 23 years after the 1950 Budget and Accounting Procedures Act, and the widespread non-enforcement of the Truth in Negotiations Act against contractors. Rickover challenges financial managers to ask themselves if they would spend their own money this way, advocating for courageous action over &quot;negative consensus&quot; and rejecting &quot;esoteric management systems&quot; in favor of direct, diligent oversight.

Rickover delivers a stark warning about the rapidly developing energy crisis, framing it as a diminishing capital resource. He critiques the prevailing optimism and public demands for cheap, abundant energy without environmental impact, emphasizing that fossil fuels are finite and being consumed at an unsustainable rate (e.g., half the world&#x27;s oil production occurred in the past 15 years, despite 600 millennia to form). Rickover highlights the precarious U.S. position, consuming one-third of the world&#x27;s resources with only 6% of the population, and projects the U.S. will import half its oil (12-18 million barrels/day) in &quot;a few years.&quot; He dismisses man-made energy alternatives like fusion as uncertain, and others like solar as too costly or limited, stressing that the fact of depletion is more important than its exact timing. The speech underscores the geopolitical implications, particularly the Middle East&#x27;s 70% share of oil reserves and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s vital role in protecting trade routes. Rickover proposes a series of drastic conservation measures, including discontinuing energy resource exports (e.g., enriched uranium), reconsidering population growth incentives, revising utility pricing to discourage consumption, taxing heavy automobiles, prohibiting utilities from deducting market expansion expenses, and controlling inefficient uses like electric heating and air conditioning, all aimed at gaining time to find viable solutions for a future without abundant fossil fuels." data-year="1972" data-themes="Energy">

G. Rickover critically examines the American educational system in the aftermath of the Sputnik challenge, arguing that the nation&#x27;s response has been &quot;uncertain&quot; and &quot;faltering.&quot; Rickover contends that misleading statistics and pervasive &quot;clichés&quot; create an &quot;illusory picture&quot; of American educational achievement, masking significant deficiencies, especially when compared to European systems. He asserts that a European school year offers &quot;at least a third higher&quot; educational value, citing better-qualified teachers, more rigorous curricula, and higher student attainment, allowing Europeans to reach the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor&#x27;s degree in 12-13 years versus America&#x27;s 16. Rickover supports his claims with striking figures, including a 25% draftee illiteracy rate and the fact that 60% of the U.S. population over 25 had fewer than eleven years of schooling, contrasting these with historical Prussian attendance records and lower illiteracy rates in Germany and Japan. He attributes the stagnation to resistance from &quot;vested interests&quot; within the educational establishment and a system run by administrators rather than teachers, ultimately hindering necessary reform." data-year="1965" data-themes="Education">

He challenges the &quot;preposterous notion&quot; that anything technically feasible is inherently right and lawful, asserting that technology should serve man, not dictate his behavior. Rickover contrasts the ethical, human-centric approach of professions like publishing and medicine (citing the Hippocratic Oath) with the profit-driven motives of &quot;pure administrators&quot; in large organizations, which he warns are eroding essential human rights like freedom of speech, turning them into mere economic considerations. Citing figures on wealth inequality and educational shortfalls, he highlights how modern societal conditions, exacerbated by technological complexity and the rise of bureaucratic governance, diverge from the Founders&#x27; vision of self-reliant citizens, urging a renewed commitment to education and individual responsibility to preserve the &quot;precious heritage of freedom&quot; for future generations." data-year="1965" data-themes="Technology,Society">

He sharply criticizes conventional industry for its pervasive failure to meet the exacting quality requirements of new technologies, particularly nuclear reactor components, despite significant public investment (noting that nearly $12 billion of $16 billion in R&amp;D comes from taxpayer&#x27;s pockets). Rickover details widespread quality control issues in welding, casting, and radiography, citing alarming statistics such as only 10% of 99 carbon steel welds meeting ASME standards and a manufacturer&#x27;s 47% rejection rate for shop welds. He recounts a critical incident where a wrongly-specified stainless steel fitting was installed in a nuclear submarine, leading to a fleet-wide check that uncovered 12 such errors.

Rickover&#x27;s 1959 address, delivered at the 90th anniversary of Roosevelt Hospital, issues a stark warning about America&#x27;s technological standing. Titled &quot;The Role of the Professional Man,&quot; the speech argues that US administrative interference and an overemphasis on egalitarianism are stifling professional independence and innovation, turning experts into mere technicians. Rickover draws a pointed historical parallel to 19th-century England&#x27;s decline relative to Germany due to its undervaluing of intellect and education (citing Mathew Arnold and John Erskine), asserting that the US now faces a similar challenge from the Soviet Union. He presents striking figures, noting that by 1957, the USSR had significantly more scientific and technical professionals, with higher growth rates and advanced degrees, contributing to faster &quot;lead times&quot; in development (2.5 years for Russia vs. 5-10 for the US). Rickover implores the medical profession, whom he praises for their autonomy and societal respect, to use their influence to advocate for the proper role and independence of all professionals, emphasizing &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; as crucial for national security and progress." data-year="1959" data-themes="Society,Work">

Rickover&#x27;s October 9, 1959, acceptance speech for the National League of Masonic Clubs&#x27; Meritorious Service Medal, where he transitions from discussing his celebrated contributions as the &quot;father of the atomic submarine&quot; to passionately addressing the critical state of American education. Rickover expresses deep concern, citing his dismay with the &quot;inferior product&quot; of the US educational system and drawing stark comparisons with the rigorous Soviet model. He presents alarming statistics, including that Russia graduated 40% more scientists and engineers than the US in the previous year, was projected to graduate 200,000 by 1961 (compared to America&#x27;s 130,000), and boasted a larger total STEM workforce in 1957. Rickover links Russia&#x27;s impressive economic growth (9.5% annually vs. US&#x27;s 4%) directly to their demanding 10-month, 6-day-a-week school system, which emphasizes subject mastery and requires knowledge equivalent to two years of US college for high school graduates. He critiques the American system&#x27;s shorter school year (180 days versus Europe&#x27;s 240-280), 10% functional illiteracy rate, and the influence of &quot;professional educators&quot; who prioritize &quot;life-adjustment&quot; over academic subjects, advocating for national educational standards and warning that &quot;any nation that neglects education has already joined the ranks of the defeated.&quot; The speech also references his related works, &quot;Report on Russia&quot; and &quot;Education and Freedom.&quot;" data-year="1959" data-themes="Education">

He cites alarming statistics, such as Russia&#x27;s 10% lead in scientific/technical manpower in 1957, projected to reach 25% by 1961, and a 10-15 year lead in rocket control. Rickover refutes claims that Russian schools neglect humanities, stating they devote comparable time to both humanities and sciences as US schools, and criticizes American educationists for misleading the public with untrue statistics regarding graduation rates (e.g., only 55-58% of US 5th graders graduate high school, compared to a similar percentage of Russian ten-year school graduates who receive a far more rigorous education). He highlights that European children are two years ahead in arithmetic by sixth grade and gain a liberal arts education in 12-13 years, equivalent to 16 years in the US. Rickover decries the decline in US foreign language teaching, the prevalence of &quot;life-adjustment&quot; training over solid content, and the resistance to reform by &quot;professional educationists&quot; who, in his view, prioritize administrative control and &quot;democratic togetherness&quot; over academic excellence. He emphasizes his right to criticize as a concerned citizen, linking educational quality directly to national strength and the supply of qualified professionals needed for fields like nuclear propulsion." data-year="1959" data-themes="Society,Education">

G. Rickover critiques America&#x27;s complacency and its &quot;costly illusions,&quot; arguing they undermine the nation&#x27;s ability to compete with totalitarian powers in the global arena. He contends that the US high standard of living, focused on consumer goods and fueled by an unsustainable depletion of non-renewable resources (e.g., consuming raw materials 8x faster per capita than the rest of the world, citing the Twentieth Century Fund and Paley Report), is a strategic liability. Rickover contrasts this with the efficiency and hardihood of totalitarian states like Russia, noting its remarkable resilience during WWII (as documented by Raymond L. Garthoff), and China&#x27;s self-sustaining communes, which prioritize military and state strength. He challenges the perception of inherent American technological superiority, highlighting that many fundamental scientific discoveries and inventions—including electricity, the tank, radar, and a disproportionate number of Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry, along with much of the foundational work in atomic fission—originated in Europe. Rickover concludes by urging Americans to abandon these illusions, embrace critical self-analysis, and reorient their values towards national interest, resource conservation, and the development of human potential beyond mere material acquisition." data-year="1959" data-themes="Navy,Accountability">

Rickover discusses the profound significance of the USS Nautilus&#x27; transpolar voyage, describing it as an epic achievement that fulfilled a long-standing U.S. Navy goal for Arctic exploration, dating back to Lt. George W. DeLong&#x27;s 1879 Jeanette expedition. While celebrating the Nautilus&#x27; technological marvel—operating at over 20 knots under the icecap—Rickover delivers a stark warning: nuclear propulsion has removed the Arctic&#x27;s protective barrier, transforming it into a new, accessible military theater. He highlights the alarming threat posed by the Soviet Union&#x27;s massive submarine fleet, which numbered approximately 450 against the U.S.&#x27;s 110, having built 350 new subs since WWII compared to the U.S.&#x27;s 21, and possessing a force ten times larger than Germany&#x27;s at the start of WWII. Despite the U.S.&#x27;s current lead in nuclear submarine technology (with 5 operating and 28 authorized, including the faster Skipjack, larger Triton, and the Skate which replicated the Nautilus&#x27; feat), and the development of POLARIS missile capabilities and future nuclear surface fleets by 1961, Rickover stresses that the Nautilus represents a &quot;beginning,&quot; not an end. He issues an urgent call for intensified efforts to rapidly build nuclear naval assets, asserting that &quot;Our survival as a nation may depend upon it&quot; to maintain freedom of the seas against this formidable and rapidly advancing adversary." data-year="1958" data-themes="Navy">
