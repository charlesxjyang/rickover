      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a 1979 address to the &quot;Order of 5-48&quot; at the Rayburn House Office Building, Admiral H.G. Rickover delivered a sharp critique of federal government management, attributing a pervasive lack of public trust to the rise of abstract &quot;modern management&quot; techniques and a disproportionate number of &quot;managers and checkers&quot; over &quot;doers.&quot; Drawing on over 50 years of government service, Rickover advocates for a return to fundamental principles: fostering genuine &quot;ownership&quot; and long-term commitment to one&#x27;s job, ensuring singular &quot;responsibility&quot; instead of diffused accountability, demanding meticulous &quot;attention to detail,&quot; disciplined &quot;prioritization,&quot; and a direct understanding of operations rather than relying on &quot;management information systems.&quot; He emphasizes the necessity of &quot;hard work,&quot; independent &quot;checking up&quot; for quality control, &quot;formality&quot; in communications for historical record, and the courage to &quot;face the facts&quot; and implement difficult changes, warning that a failure to adopt these tangible actions could lead to an escalating &quot;taxpayers revolt.&quot;</p>

<p>REMARKS OF DE Livéay<br>Aow H.G. Ricxover, U.S. Navy _ Copy<br>Ar A MEETING OF THE<br>“ORDER OF 5-48”<br>ON<br>15 Noverper 1979</p>
<p>At THE<br>RAYBURN HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING</p>
<p>TODAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LITTLE TRUST IN THOSE WHO WORK<br>FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO AN EXTENT THIS LACK OF CONFIDENCE IS<br>JUSTIFIED, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES SENIOR MANAGERS, SINCE THE<br>END OF WORLD War IT THE NUMBER OF HIGH GRADE CIVILIANS IN RELATION<br>TO THE TOTAL GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE HAS STEADILY INCREASED TO THE POINT<br>WHERE WE HAVE MORE MANAGERS AND CHECKERS THAN WE HAVE DOERS. THIS<br>INCREASE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PURVEYORS OF THE “TECHNIQUES</p>
<p>¢</p>
<p>OF MODERN MANAGEMENT.” QuUR SENIOR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN SCHOOLED IN</p>
<p>THIS “NEW” PHILOSOPHY WHICH HOLDS THAT AS LONG AS A PERSON IS WELL~<br>VERSED IN A FEW SIMPLE RULES OF HOW TO HANDLE PEOPLE AND SITUATIONS,<br>HE NEED NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE PROGRAMS HE IS<br>MANAGING OR THE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES ON WHICH<br>MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE BASED, THIS HAS ALLOWED THE NON-PROFES-<br>SIONAL TO ACHIEVE HIGH STATUS AND HIGH PAY WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT,<br>THESE “MANAGERS” CAN MOVE EASILY FROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER WITHOUT<br>THE SLIGHTEST PAUSE. AS LONG AS THEIR AREA DOES NOT BECOME A PUBLIC<br>DISASTER THEY ARE SAFE. IF TROUBLE ERUPTS, THEY ARE LOST; THEY CAN<br>THEN BLAME THOSE BENEATH THEM OR THOSE WHO PRECEDED THEM. UNTIL</p>
<p>THIS FALSE CONCEPT IS ROOTED OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CANNOT</p>
<p>EXPECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REGAIN THEIR TRUST IN GOVERNMENT.<br>IN FACT, THEY SHOULD NOT,</p>
<p>I DO NOT HOLD MUCH HOPE FOR THIS BEING DONE BEFORE A MAJOR<br>DISASTER BEFALLS THE UNITED STATES. But I CAN PROVIDE SOME BASIC<br>PRINCIPLES FOR DOING A JOB THAT I HAVE FOLLOWED FOR OVER 50 YEARS<br>OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND WHICH | HAVE INSTILLED IN MY SENIOR<br>MANAGERS, IF THESE PRINCIPLES WERE EMPHASIZED INSTEAD OF THE<br>PRESENT ONES, IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARD REVERSING THE CURRENT<br>TREND, UNFORTUNATELY, MANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN<br>THE “NEW MANAGEMENT” SYSTEM WILL PROBABLY NEVER UNDERSTAND THE<br>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES I OFFER,</p>
<p>OWNERSHIP</p>
<p>A PERSON DOING A JOB—ANY JOB—MUST FEEL THAT HE OWNS IT AND<br>THAT HE WILL REMAIN ON THAT JOB INDEFINITELY. IF HE FEELS HE IS A<br>TEMPORARY CUSTODIAN, OR IS USING THE JOB AS A STEPPING STONE TO A<br>HIGHER POSITION, HIS ACTIONS WILL PROBABLY NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE<br>LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF THE COUNTRY. LACK OF COMMITMENT TO THE<br>PRESENT JOB WILL BE PERCEIVED BY THOSE WHO WORK FOR HIMjAND THEY ALSO<br>WILL TEND NOT TO CARE. IF HE FEELS HE OWNS HIS JOB AND ACTS ACCORD-<br>INGLY, HE NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT HIS NEXT JOB. HE SHOULD EXERCISE A<br>DEVOTION TO HIS WORK AS IF HIS CHILDREN WERE THE DIRECT BENEFICIARIES<br>OF WHAT HE IS DOING, AS INDEED THEY ARE. 00 MANY SPEND THEIR ENTIRE<br>LIVES LOOKING FOR THE NEXT JOB. WE NEED TO MAKE IT CHALLENGING AND<br>REWARDING FOR MANAGERS TO REMAIN IN ONE ORGANIZATION FOR MORE THAN A<br>FEW YEARS, THEREBY THE ORGANIZATION WILL BENEFIT FROM THEIR KNOWLEDGE,<br>EXPERIENCE, AND “CORPORATE” MEMORY. |</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>ALONG WITH OWNERSHIP COMES THE NEED FOR ACCEPTANCE OF FULL<br>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WORK, IT IS NOW COMMON IN GOVERNMENT TO DEAL<br>WITH PROBLEMS IN A COLLECTIVE WAY, FOR EXAMPLE, A PROGRAM WILL BE<br>DIVIDED INTO COMPONENT PARTS OR INTO SUB-PROGRAMS, BUT WITH NO ONE<br>RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE EFFORT, ANOTHER APPROACH IS TO HAVE A<br>COMMITTEE RUN THE PROGRAM IN SOME PSEUDO-DEMOCRATIC FORM, OR TO<br>ESTABLISH MORE AND MORE LEVELS OF MANAGERS TO THEORETICALLY GIVE<br>BETTER CONTROL. ALL OF THESE ARE BUT DIFFERENT FORMS OF SHARED<br>RESPONSIBILITY, AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MEANS THAT NO ONE IS<br>RESPONSIBLE. UNLESS THE ONE PERSON TRULY RESPONSIBLE CAN BE IDEN-<br>TIFIED WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG, THEN NO ONE HAS BEEN REALLY</p>
<p>RESPONSIBLE,<br>ATTENTION TO DETAI|</p>
<p>A TENDENCY AMONG MANAGERS, PARTICULARLY AS THEY MOVE TO HIGHER<br>POSITIONS, IS TO THINK THEY NO LONGER NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH DETAILS,<br>IF THE BOSS IS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT DETAILS, HIS SUBORDINATES ALSO WILL<br>NOT CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT. YET &quot;THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS.” IT IS</p>
<p>HARD, MONOTONOUS, AND ONEROUS,TO PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS; MOST MANAGERS</p>
<p>WOULD RATHER FOCUS ON LOFTY mL Icy MATTERS. BUT WHEN THE DETAILS ARE<br>IGNORED, THE PROJECT FAILS; NO INFLUSION OF POLICY OR LOFTY IDEALS CAN<br>THEN CORRECT THE SITUATION, THIS PRINCIPLE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT<br>IN THOSE PROGRAMS WHERE THE APPLICATION OF SPECIAL SKILLS OR TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>1S NEEDED FOR SUCCESS,</p>
<p>PRIORITIES<br>THE NEED To PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD</p>
<p>DO EVERYTHING. ANY INDIVIDUAL HAS ONLY SO MUCH TIME TO WORK, WITH AN<br>ABSOLUTE LIMIT OF 24 HOURS EACH DAY, IF YOU ARE TO MANAGE YOUR JOB YOU</p>
<p>MUST SET PRIORITIES, TOO MANY PEOPLE LET THE JOB SET THE PRIORITIES,</p>
<p>ON ANY GIVEN DAY, SMALL, UNIMPORTANT BUT SEEMINGLY “INTERESTING” TRIVIA<br>PASS THROUGH AN OFFICE; YOU MUST AVOID LETTING THESE MONOPOLIZE Your<br>TIME, A TENDENCY OF HUMAN BEINGS Is TO WHILE AWAY TIME WITH UNIMPORTANT<br>MATTERS BECAUSE THESE DO NOT REQUIRE MENTAL EFFORT,OR ENERGY, THIS Is<br>WHY TELEVISION IS POPULAR, YOU MUST APPLY SELF-DISCIPLINE TO ENSURE YouR<br>ENERGY IS FOCUSED ON WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED,</p>
<p>OW | S GOING ON</p>
<p>YOU MUST ESTABLISH SIMPLE AND DIRECT MEANS TO FIND OUT WHAT IS<br>GOING ONIN DETAIL) IN THE AREA OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, THERE ARE WAYS<br>OF DOING THIS, BUT ALL INVOLVE CONSTANT DRUDGERY. FOR THIS REASON MOST<br>MANAGERS AVOID KEEPING UP WITH DETAILS; INSTEAD THEY CREATE &quot;MANAGEMENT<br>INFORMATION SYSTEMS.” GIMMICKS SUCH As THESE MERELY DEMONSTRATE YOU ARE<br>INCAPABLE OR UNWILLING TO USE THE NECESSARY EFFORT ON YOUR JOB,</p>
<p>I REQUIRE REGULAR, PERIODIC REPORTS DIRECTLY TO ME FROM KEY<br>PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT MY PROGRAM, I INSIST THAT THEY REPORT THE PROBLEMS<br>THEY HAVE FOUND IN PLAIN ENGLISH, AND THAT THEY REPORT THE SPECIFIC<br>ACTION THEY ARE TAKING, AND WHAT ASSISTANCE THEY NEED FROM ME, THE<br>CONCEPT THAT THE USE OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS CAN SIMPLIFY MATTERS IS SPECIOUS,<br>IT MAY SOUND ATTRACTIVE BUT IT FLIES IN THE FACE OF NATURE&#x27;S LAWS, AS |<br>HAVE OBSERVED THEM,</p>
<p>HARD WORK<br>FoR THIS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE, A MANAGER WHO DOES NOT WORK<br>HARD OR DEVOTE EXTRA EFFORT CAN NOT EXPECT HIS PEOPLE To DO so. You</p>
<p>MUST SET THE EXAMPLE, Harp WORK COMPENSATES FOR MANY SHORTCOMINGS,<br>YOU MAY NOT BE THE SMARTEST OR MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSON, BUT IF YOU<br>DEDICATE YOURSELF TO THE JOB AND PUT IN THE REQUIRED EFFORT, YOUR<br>PEOPLE WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD,</p>
<p>CHECKING UP</p>
<p>AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF CARRYING OUT MY WORK IS THE NEED To<br>HAVE IT CHECKED BY AN INDEPENDENT SouRCE, EVEN THE MOST DEDICATED<br>INDIVIDUAL MAKES MISTAKES, FURTHER, MANY ARE LESS THAN FULLY DEDICATED<br>TO THEIR WORK. IN INDUSTRY AN INDEPENDENT CHECK IS USUALLY REFERRED TO<br>AS “QUALITY CONTROL” AND IS WIDELY USED IN ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS,<br>BuT THE CONCEPT IS VALID FoR MORE THAN JUST ENGINEERING, MucH poor<br>WORK AND SHEER NONSENSE IS GENERATED IN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT IS NOT<br>SUBJECTED TO IMPARTIAL REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT,</p>
<p>FORMALITY</p>
<p>A COROLLARY OF THE CONCEPT OF CHECKING WORK IS IN THE NEED FOR<br>FORMALIZING COMMUNICATIONS AND ACTIONS, IF THIS Is NOT DONE, THEN<br>ONE IS DEPENDENT ON INDIVIDUAL MEMORY, WHICH IS QUICKLY LOST AS PEOPLE<br>LEAVE OR MOVE TO OTHER JOBS. IN MY WORK AN INVALUABLE FEATURE HAS<br>BEEN THE ABILITY TO GO BACK A NUMBER OF YEARS TO DETERMINE THE BASIS<br>FOR AN ACTION. IN THIS way AN EMERGING PROBLEM CAN BE PUT INTO PROPER<br>PERSPECTIVE, AND CAN FACILITATE TAKING THE ACTION NEEDED FOR CORRECTION,<br>IF ACTIONS ARE NOT FORMALIZED, ONE CAN NEVER BE SURE THEY ARE UNDER-<br>STOOD OR EXECUTED,</p>
<p>FACING THE FACTS<br>ANOTHER PRINCIPLE FOR MANAGING A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IS TO RESIST</p>
<p>THE NATURAL HUMAN INCLINATION TO HOPE THINGS WILL WORK OUT, DESPITE<br>EVIDENCE OR DOUBT TO THE CONTRARY. THIS MAY SEEM OBVIOUS, BUT IT IS A<br>FACTOR ONE MUST BE CONSCIOUS OF AND ACTIVELY GUARD AGAINST. IT CAN<br>HAVE A SUBTLE EFFECT, PARTICULARLY IF THE MANAGER HAS SPENT MUCH TIME<br>AND ENERGY ON A PROJECT AND HAS COME TO FEEL POSSESSIVE ABOUT IT, IT<br>IS NOT EASY TO ADMIT THAT WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS CORRECT DID NOT TURN<br>OUT THAT WAY,</p>
<p>IF CONDITIONS REQUIRE IT, ONE MUST FACE THE FACTS AND BRUTALLY<br>MAKE NEEDED CHANGES DESPITE CONSIDERABLE COSTS AND SCHEDULE DELAYS,<br>THE MAN IN CHARGE MUST PERSONALLY SET THE EXAMPLE IN THIS AREA AND<br>REQUIRE SUBORDINATES TO DO LIKEWISE, FIGURATIVELY, HE MUST, IF NECES~<br>SARY, KILL HIS OWN CHILD, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES TO HIMSELF.<br>AFTER ALL, HE IS THE TRUSTEE FOR THE GOVERNMENT; HE IS NOT THE OWNER,</p>
<p>CONCLUSTON</p>
<p>THE PRINCIPLES I HAVE STATED HAVE MANY ANCILLARY FACETS THAT CAN<br>BE FURTHER DEVELOPED. I HAVE MERELY PROVIDED THE KEY ELEMENTS, I<br>SUSPECT MOST OF THOSE HERE TODAY WILL GIVE PASSING ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND<br>MAY EVEN AGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLES. BuT UNLESS TANGIBLE ACTION IS<br>TAKEN TO PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE, THEY HAVE BEEN OF NO MERIT, THERE IS<br>A DESPERATE NEED IN GOVERNMENT FOR RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT; FOR MANAGERS<br>WHO PAY ATTENTION TO SUBSTANCE AND NOT TO GLIB &quot;MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES.”<br>IF THERE CONTINUES TO BE LITTLE MOVEMENT TOWARD MORE RESPONSIBLE AND<br>EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT ALONG THE LINES I HAVE OUTLINED, IT SHOULD COME AS<br>NO SURPRISE IF THE &quot;TAXPAYERS REVOLT” TAKES ON AN INCREASINGLY TANGIBLE</p>
<p>FORM WHICH EXTENDS EVEN INTO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</p>
