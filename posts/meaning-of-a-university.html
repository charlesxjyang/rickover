      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1965 address at the University of Birmingham, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover extols the enduring purpose of the university as a &quot;Republic of Letters,&quot; a historically continuous institution essential for the disinterested pursuit and transmission of knowledge. He expresses alarm over modern pressures, particularly the public&#x27;s inclination to perceive higher education as a &quot;consumer good&quot; or &quot;instrumentality&quot; for immediate practical uses, rather than an intrinsic goal. Rickover, citing figures like Charles Homer Haskins, Richard Hofstadter, and Nathan M. Pusey, warns that this utilitarian view, coupled with egalitarian demands for mass production, risks diluting academic quality and mislabeling inferior education as &quot;university.&quot; He stresses that a university&#x27;s true strength lies in the caliber of its human constituents (&quot;batie en hommes&quot;), arguing that diverting it from its core responsibility of fostering intellectual growth for the sake of &quot;ordinary mundane needs&quot; is unwise and amounts to &quot;eating our seed corn.&quot;</p>

        <p>The meaning of a university | ~ cleared by ses for open publication</p>
<p>vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Navyl 1 yun 1965 8 at the ee Graduation Ceremonies PIRECTORATE FOR SG! sae pete University of Birmingham rn DEPARTMENT OF = Birmingham, England Friday, July 16, 1965</p>
<p>I am grateful for the honor you have bestowed upon me and happy to</p>
<p>share in your graduation exercises.</p>
<p>To witness this ceremony 4g a moving experience. Each roll of parchment put into the hand of a young man or woman represents a promise» fulfilled; the promise of a mind potentially able to reach the level of learning that earns an academic degree. The young people here assembled</p>
<p>have made good on the promise.</p>
<p>Being born bright 4s pure luck, put to complete the long and tough</p>
<p>course of studies that brings this special gift to fruition is 4 personal</p>
<p>| achievement --the kind of victory in which everyone can rejoice, for it is won on individual resources alone, with no aid from social, material or technical props. The diploma you receive today is a just and fair assessment of proven competence. Rarely will any prize won in later life so</p>
<p>precisely measure personal merit, pure and simple.</p>
<p>The traditional solemnities of this ceremony remind us forcefully of jne continuity and unity of higher learning in Western civilization. Today's graduates are only a small contingent in a long procession stretching pack some eight hundred years to the studium generale of the high Middle Ages to a time so remote from our daily lives that it seems extraordinary any of its institutions should have survived. Yet, as the late Charles Homer Haskins of Harvard remarked, much of the institutional framework of the medieval university lives on: its character as &quot;an association of masters and scholars leading the common life of learning&quot;; its corporate organization with faculties and deans and a. rector; ‘the notion of a curriculum of study, definitely laid down as regards time and subjects, tested by an examination and leading to a degree, as well as many of the degrees : themselves.&quot; Plato's Academy and the Greek. and Roman professional schools of medicine and law may pe considered forerunners, but the university itself 4s an invention of the European Middle Ages, arising 45 part of, and in | response to the revival of learning of the twelfth century --the First Renaissance. | |</p>
<p>One can but marvel that a society rigidly divided into hereditary | elasses, each performing a designated practical function, should have tolerated associations of scholars cutting across class lines; corporate bodies into which one entered of one's own volition--if one had the requisite intelligence--and not ‘pecause his father had been a member. I</p>
<p>find it amazing too that medieval society, which produced only a small</p>
<p>surplus above the minimum that sustains life, get aside some of this surplus | to support intellectual activities that must have seemed of little practical</p>
<p>value to most people. Yet universities obviously stood high in popular</p>
<p>Tteliams because they have the Popes University of Paris.&quot;</p>
<p>three organisms stood,</p>
<p>jeem, as witmess the saying of the time: “Tree nations are more</p>
<p>irtumate than all others: The Germans pecause they have the Emperor, the</p>
<p>Uh a</p>
<p>and the French pecause they have the | In the formalized thinking of medieval man, these</p>
<p>respectively, for Power, Faith and Wisdom.</p>
<p>It was early recognized that. there could be no disinterested pursuit</p>
<p>of knowledge unless the university was protected against political and</p>
<p>dogmatic interference. Therefore, from its inception, the university sought</p>
<p>to establish itself as an entity separate from, and perhaps equal to State</p>
<p>and Church; as a Republic of Letters. This was the only way then possible</p>
<p>to achieve independence in the management of its own affairs. t matters because I want to emphasize what</p>
<p>In the</p>
<p>I have dwelt on these ancien has remained constant throughout the university's long history.</p>
<p>present age of rapid and drastic change, brought on by the scientific and</p>
<p>technological revolution, we are inclined to look askance at anything old,</p>
<p>assuming that technology has rendered 4t obsolete. This assumption,</p>
<p>whatever 4ts validity for changes an the material aspects of life, does not,</p>
<p>eo ipso, apply to human peings;, to their intellectual and spiritual growth »</p>
<p>their ethical commitments , their relations with one another--to the very</p>
<p>matters that concern education in general and the university in particular.</p>
<p>Before we seek to alter. the character or functions of an institution which</p>
<p>has so excellently served man over S80 long a span of time, I suggest we</p>
<p>ponder most carefully the possible ‘consequences of any proposed change.</p>
<p>Straightforward meddling by government or by religious podies does not</p>
<p>often oceur 4n civilized modern democracies; but other, newer, possibly</p>
<p>more dangerous pressures are beginning to pear down on the university; not</p>
<p>eS</p>
<p>‘This is to be explained by the tendency of the public, even in the most</p>
<p>the same extent in every country, put to some extent nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>fmey threaten the university's unique task which is to hold in trust the</p>
<p>mighest level of knowledge attained by contemporary man; to re-examine, reformulate, and enlarge this knowledge and to pass it on to young scholars. it has always</p>
<p>The university can perform this task only if it remains what</p>
<p>Been, an association of scholars; and if it is allowed to pursue, without</p>
<p>concern with knowledge at the highest</p>
<p>outside interference, its disinterested I should like in the remainder of my remarks to discuss</p>
<p>intellectual level. priefly some of the new pressures currently threatening the essential function and character of universities.</p>
<p>Like other organizations which provide valuable nonmaterialistic benefits--for example, top level music or art--universities cannot earn their way. This means they must depend upon patrons; consequently upon the capacity of ‘patrons to understand and value the particular work a university does. In modern democracies, the principal patron is the electorate. Even when universities have large private endowments, they usually require some Financial help from the taxpayer. Moreover, the tax exemption of their = endowments depends on the good will of the electorate.</p>
<p>As a patron, the electoral majority in most countries has a somewhat uneven record. Nearly everywhere it is in favor of education and reasonably generous in voting education funds, but at times it meddles unwisely, evincing less respect for university autonomy than certain royal autocrats. Thus Halle, in the early years of the eighteenth century, enjoyed a more secure libertas philosophandi under Frederick William I than do some modern</p>
<p>universities which depend financially on popularly elected legislatures .</p>
<p>_ eeemmity in the handlin</p>
<p>(Sne@ end politically mature counkeiaks of viewing universities through</p>
<p>slies ground to utilitarian and egalitarian notions about education.</p>
<p>Ber most people 4t is difficult to overcome a deep conviction that</p>
<p>~ so costly to the taxpayer a5 higher education ought to have</p>
<p>“practical” having the connotation</p>
<p>e@iately discernible practical uses,</p>
<p>memities , comforts, material things; also of services to the adult</p>
<p>g of problems that require expertise. Exactly the</p>
<p>t able to supply if it is to meet fully its</p>
<p>ort of things 4 university is not the university's activities</p>
<p>basic responsibilities. Indirectly of course,</p>
<p>@m yield the results desired by the public. From actical products; put these have peen</p>
<p>some of its most esoteric</p>
<p>researches have eome eminently pr</p>
<p>eweloped outside the university. Rarely does the public at large grasp</p>
<p>+his mecessary two-step procedure. Instead, it would like to order</p>
<p>s lamb chops from the putcher, not realizing</p>
<p>university research as one order</p>
<p>at the most productive use society ean make of a scholar is to leave him</p>
<p>free to pursue 4deas that 4nterest him, whether they appear to lead to useful ends or not.</p>
<p>Let me quote two Americans who have commented perceptively on popular</p>
<p>of higher education. They deseribe American attitudes, put I note</p>
<p>that similar attitudes are peginning to pe discernible 4n Europe as well.</p>
<p>According to Richard Hofstadter, the public looks on education as &quot;an</p>
<p>an one of the goals of life, &quot; and feels that</p>
<p>s Harvard's president, Nathan M. Pusey,</p>
<p>instrumentality rather th</p>
<p>education “ought to pay its way.</p>

<p>eoumseribed, narrowly material world of men which drains most of our</p>
<p>mergies into its service and will not, unless it is made to do so, yield</p>
<p>msi meaning beyond its own superficial self.&quot; Universities, he declares,</p>
<p>“were not put into the world to play the aevviie role of administering</p>
<p>exclusively to ordinary mundane needs.&quot; TI would amend this to say that</p>
<p>es them, ought never to concern the</p>
<p>ordinary mundane needs, as Pusey defin</p>
<p>umiversity at all. Nor should the university be used as a reservoir of expertise upon</p>
<p>which the adult world may call whenever it encounters difficult problems.</p>
<p>If as an institution it is drawn into handling such problems as urban</p>
<p>congestion, unemployment, social inequalities and the like, or if individual</p>
<p>Mn ti a tatu ttt thee</p>
<p>professors are lured away--often in the middle of class--to act as</p>
<p>consultants 0 government or industry, the purpose of the university 4s</p>
<p>subverted. This purpose 4s not to deal directly with such matters, but to train professionals who will then be equipped to handle them. Again, the</p>
<p>two-step procedure.</p>
<p>No modern society is prepared to do without the benefits that flow</p>
<p>directly or indirectly from the work that universities alone are able to do,</p>
<p>not the least of these being the education of professionals who have become :</p>
<p>the one wholly indispensable part of a modern work force; without whom,</p>
<p>indeed, modern society eannot function ‘at all. Most technically advanced</p>
<p>countries are hard put to meet the demand for these people. Under the as it is ungenerous, to divert</p>
<p>Ungenerous, because: we rob</p>
<p>circumstances it would seem to be as unwise, the university from its basic responsibilities: youth of the full attention they must have from their university; unwise</p>
<p>pecause we are eating our seed corn.</p>
<p>Smstitution, as are opera companies; symphony orche</p>
<p>Frevenrvvvrvvreeviiivvirreenscrety</p>
<p>T= would also appear the better part of wisdom to refrain from</p>
<p>e the essential character of the university, for the</p>
<p>o a special kina of work is predicated on its</p>

<p>capabilities. Most people can sing a little or play an instrument of some</p>
<p>kind, or dance or ski or swim or run. But only a few qualify for admission</p>
<p>top performance in these fields is expected.</p>
<p>tO the elite Anstitutions where</p>
<p>- Every normal child, properly taught, is able to complete an education</p>
<p>that makes him literate and numerate and gives him mastery of the elements</p>
<p>of learning he needs to function on his own in today's complex society.</p>
<p>tary education and specialized And</p>
<p>But not all can absorb enough post-elemen</p>
<p>training to become skilled workers, technicians or semiprofessionals.</p>
<p>only 2 minority of young people have the requisite intelligence for academic</p>
<p>studies. Of these potential university students, not a few prefer other</p>
<p>for example. Nearly half of those ae</p>
<p>eareers--the women among them, marriage,</p>
<p>who start out on 4 university preparatory program do not complete it.</p>
<p>every bright child could be discovered and induced to develop his mind to</p>
<p>the fullest, perhaps as many. as ten percent of a given age group might</p>
<p>complete 4 university education. Countries now poasting of larger university</p>
<p>enrollments simply equate a much Lower type of education with that pursued at a true university.</p>
<p>Four centuries 2£0&gt; Pasquier said universities were puilt of men,</p>
<p>This is as true today as it was then. What makes 4</p>
<p>&quot;patie en hommes.&quot; Lower the quality of</p>
<p>university is the caliber of its human constituents.</p>
<p>@ @oagents or of the professoriate and you have something other than a</p>
<p>sity. It may be an institution surrounding itself with the most m@iforous paraphernalia of higher learning--buildings, libraries, EB ogorics, playing fields; it may hand out beautifully engraved degrees, et @li this is debased academic coin. A story about Abraham Lineoln, comes _@2 mind. He asked: &quot;If you call a dog's tail a leg, how many. legs has he?&quot;</p>
<p>| ‘Ge auswer being &quot;five,&quot; he said: &quot;Ohno. Calling a tail a leg doesn't</p>
<p>z | est so.</p>
<p>T boost “university” enrollment figures by mislabeling inferior =eecitetioms is futile; sooner or later the truth will out. Yet, it appeals te #@ gublic more concerned with the names of schools and degrees than with |</p>
<p>of the education these represent.</p>
<p>Wocthime so becomes modern man as his determination that every child</p>
<p>“ “em =m equal chance to become educated. Out of this determination has</p>
<p>-mod@erm trend toward shifting financial responsibility for educating</p>
<p>_@rom parent to taypayer--beginning long ago with elementary</p>
<p>lime =xd mow proceeding apace toward complete elimination of the cost Gumtarr im bigemer education as well.</p>
<p>Goo t]emorime the price tag has had the curious and perhaps unexpected</p>
<p>&lt;{+ &lt;==t im popular thinking education has become a “consumer” good. By</p>
<p>yig 7 meer thet the public regards it as but one of the many desirable</p>
<p>qem@umer IGemse moderm societies offer all their citizens at no cost to the.</p>
<p>l recipient. or at greatly reduced cost. They expect higher eSuretiam to be mess produced and shared out equally. Any demand that one mast qualify for it strikes them as &quot;undemocratic.&quot;</p>
<p>Beecetiom @if7fers from other consumer items in that it can never be</p>
<p>@ tiem the offer of an opportunity which the individuat must then earn</p>
<p>grime the necessary effort. It was go when parents paid school fees</p>
<p>aot 2c camnot be otherwise even when fees are epolisher: Socializing the se 2? education merely eliminates &quot;ability to pay&quot; as a prerequisite. It | merely equalizes children as far as the. financial resources of their parents are concerned. It does not equalize human intellect or the motivating power that drives some bright ehildren through a tough preparatory program and into phe university, while others, equally prignt, arop out on the way. } |</p>
<p>There is evidence of some correlation petween family packground and success in higher education. This is aifficult for citizens in 4 democracy so accept. I suspect 4t has been aifficult to accept for Russia's rulers as well. Egalitarianism, as you know, 4s part or the Communist faith. Children of educated parents obtain seven times as many ims 4n Russian higher education than their actual numbers warrant. This was true even in the days when the government actively discriminated against them.</p>
<p>I am shocked that democratic egalitarianism practices its own discrimination against children. Dogmatic egalitarians | who oppose separation of academically talented children at the age when they are ready to pegin aniversity-preparatory: studies are never concerned with the educational needs of pright children, only with those of the less able. It is argued that schools--oFr classrooms -—— &quot;geprived&quot; of the prignt would lose tone; the enildren left behind, and their teachers would feel discouraged; they would lack leaders and so On. I find this readiness of dogmatic egalitarians to</p>
<p>&quot;use&quot; prignht children for the ends of others quite appalling. Spould not</p>
<p>the Kantian imperative apply to children as well? “He said: ‘gyery man is</p>
<p>i respected as an absolute end in himself; and it is a erime against the gety that pelongs to him as a human peing, to use him as a mere means for me external purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>Apart from humanitarian considerations, T believe much talent is lost shrough parriers set uP by egalitarian dogmatists. Children held pack when they are ready to move a4nto the higher levels of secondary education will be pored and may lose interest in education altogether. Their potential for academic studies is wasted; consequently, the universities will send out fewer of the much needed professionals.</p>
<p>The university eannot increase its student pody unless the flow of talent from the secondary level proceeds at its proper pace. There is need, I think, for wider understanding of the whole interlocking process of higher learning. To help the public achieve 4 petter comprehension is a responsibility university alumni ought to assume, as 4 small quid pro que for the precious opportunity which was given them to earn a university education. &quot;A university,&quot; as Dr. Pusey said, &quot;is one of the noblest creations of the mind of man and one deserving the widest and wisest</p>
<p>understanding.&quot;</p>
