      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s 1982 memo, &quot;The Will and The Way,&quot; delivers a scathing critique of American education, positing that a lack of professional standards for teachers and a misguided shift from academic excellence to &quot;egalitarian socialization&quot; have led to a national decline. He substantiates this argument with striking figures, including the military&#x27;s $60 million annual expenditure on remedial reading, the fact that 25-40% of college freshmen require remedial work, stagnant SAT scores, and significantly lower GRE aptitude scores for education majors. Rickover champions comprehensive reforms, advocating for a return to rigorous liberal education centered on the &quot;three R&#x27;s,&quot; mandatory academic courses prioritized over electives, nationwide standardized performance examinations, and performance-based teacher compensation. He emphasizes the crucial responsibility of parents and students in demanding and pursuing educational excellence, citing successful reforms like the Modesto, California plan, which saw 20-30 point SAT score increases. The memo also references articles such as a Wall Street Journal report on school violence to underscore the challenges, ultimately urging an unwavering commitment to intellectual achievement to safeguard the nation&#x27;s future.</p>

<p>_ THE WILL AND THE WAY (Some Thoughts on Im mproving American Education)</p>
<p>By admiral H.'G. Rickover, U.S. navy</p>
<p>No occupation can be conducted properly unless it has</p>
<p>Standards. This is true of the Presidency, the Congress, the</p>
<p>to measure performance, ‘through the ballot box, : of promotions,. or profits /</p>
<p>military and of industry. In most of life, criteria are established</p>
<p>Teaching, on the other hand, as important a profession as any-- r and in my estimation more important--has few if any standards. : This operates to the great advantage of teachers who, as a result,</p>
<p>do not generally have to qualify for their positions. Yet their vocation is most important because it is through schools that &quot; society transmits our knowledge, history, responsibilities and</p>
<p>aspirations.</p>
<p>* Weegee</p>
<p>No knowledgeable observer of the American scene would agree that our teachers, especially in secondary schools, are</p>
<p>acequate for providing the high degree of excellence essential</p>
<p>to the national welfare.</p>
<p>The reason I write feelingly on this subject is because I</p>
<p>came to this country as an immigrant at the age of six--without knowing a word of English. Yet because of our educational system</p>
<p>I was able to learn English quickly, able to develop other</p>
<p>SAD amines &amp;</p>
<p>interests, able to go to the Naval Academy, and subsequently to carry out important assignments. What I was able to accomplish</p>
<p>“was due to two things: First, my desire to learn; second, a litle</p>
<p>good free educational system.</p>
<p>Without such a system and its dedicated teachers, I could not have accomplished this. It is for this reason I am writing about the need to have the best education for our children.</p>
<p>We can give them a pleasant life, clothe them well, amuse then. But nothing we can do for them is as valuable as a good education. Further, education has lasting value. Not only does it influence the individual, but it can be passed on to our descendants. In this way we are doubly served by a good educational system.</p>
<p>In line with these thoughts I will describe some things I</p>
<p>consider we must do to insure the best education for our children.</p>
<p>Just how bad things remain!</p>
<p>is well illustrated by the fact that the largest users of our high school graduates--business, industry, colleges and the military--are often forced to build</p>
<p>and operate their own remedial programs, especially in mathematics and English. The military, for example, spends some $60 million per year in developing basic reading skills; between 25-40% of enrolled college freshmen require remedial work.”</p>
<p>This represents the expenditure of large amounts of time and money for basic education which properly should have been completed at the high school level.</p>
<p>There have been some salutory changes in our education system</p>
<p>since Sputnik. These include greater percentages of minority</p>
<p>and under-privileged children in school and increasing rates of high school completion®. “But these changes have been bought</p>
<p>at a cost--an average decline in overall intellectual competence of college bound high school graduates, and a failure to develop</p>
<p>specific skills among those who leave high schools to enter the</p>
<p>work force.“</p>
<p>The poorly educated adult becomes one more member of an increasingly large &quot;underclass,&quot; and further may become a burden on our society. In the national sense, poor education spells decline. The result is an inadequate pool of competent citizens, not only in technology and science, but in other areas where high achievement is necessary to maintain our position inter- nationally--military and economic. Moreover, we can not remain confident of relying on importing brains and skills from other countries when we fail to produce our own.</p>
<p>The long-term decline in academic performance is most evidenced by declining Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores. The recent heralded reversal in this trend is minor and Statistically insignificant. A mere 3 points rise in average SATs offers no basis for optimism; rather it represents a bottoming out at an abysmal level. With 800 being a perfect score in each of the two parts of the test, the average verbal score in 1982 rose only 2 points from 424 to 426 while the math score rose from 466 to 467.</p>
<p>It is possible that this recent rise reflects proportionately fewer--but better qualified--students entering college and taking the SATs. In any event, &quot;one swallow does not make a summer.&quot; It is just too early to be sure of any long-term upward movement. The American public school system--not only in terms of its</p>
<p>specific curricular and teaching deficiencies--has changed over the</p>
<p>last decade in an unfortunate direction. This is because of the novel idea that our schools should be egalitarian socializers, instead of, as should be the case, excellent educators. This emphasis on</p>
<p>“fitting in&quot;, &quot;compensating&quot;, &quot;affirming&quot; and &quot;democratizing&quot; is</p>
<p>deleterious to academic excellence. It deprives students and</p>
<p>educators of precious time more appropriately required to achieve intellectually broad and employable competencies in the process of learning, thinking and analysis. These can be achieved only through the intensive development of speaking and writing skills.</p>
<p>Our secondary schools have tried to do too many things for too many constituencies. The result of irrelevant activities can be measured by the decline in time and resources devoted to basic teaching and learning--in the shift in educational priorities to non-academic pursuits such as training of athletes, building of administrative staffs and the use of teachers as day-care custodians for unmotivated adolescents.</p>
<p>We have seen a decline in required courses, especially of the so-called &quot;academic solids&quot; and those having to do with achieving competence in fields as foreign languages, math and science. Instead, the curricula have an increased number of &quot;relevant&quot; courses, especially those for &quot;alternative learning&quot; and general entertainment. Tests of competence in subject matter have been replaced by subjective tests and grading on the curve; by de-emphasis on written expository skills and substitution of &quot;objective&quot; exams. These may facilitate quick grading and easy quantitative scoring, but they are inappropriate for testing intellectual acuity, verbal fluency, and the theoretical proficiency required in today's world.</p>
<p>Some of the blame rests on teachers; their low ‘ abilities. At the colleges where they are trained, they are among</p>
<p>the lowest as measured by Graduate Record Examination Aptitude Test Scores. Students whose intended field of study was</p>
<p>in the education area (four categories--education including M.A.</p>
<p>in teaching, educational administration, guidance/counseling,</p>
<p>and physical education) averaged 440 Verbal and 467 in the Quantitative scoring in the GRE-Aptitude Test Scores administered from 1977 through 1980. In comparison, all seniors and non- enrolled college graduates for the same period, whose fields of endeavor were other than education, averaged 497 Verbal and 531 in the Quantitative scoring. Further, many major in methods of education instead of substantial academic disciplines. Further, good teachers must spend considerable time on non-teaching tasks and on discipline. For example, the following Wall Street Journal article of November 17, 1982, entitled &quot;Righteous Indignation&quot; states: &quot;A Brooklyn, N.Y. high school principal last week asked police to search Students entering the building for weapons. The search uncovered knives, razor blades, iron pipes and karate Sticks. Hundreds of Students then rioted, wrecking the school and beating up a teacher. A community group has now charged the Board of Education with</p>
<p>&quot;provoking a riot.</p>
<p>Some of the blame for this deplorable state must be placed on principals and administrators. It has been remarked that while &quot;The principal is the chief protector of educational internalities... too many principals are people whose foremost value is not rocking the boat.” This, together with the fact that principals and school boards often reinforce each other's administrative deficiencies and political timidity, guarantees a teaching</p>
<p>environment not Supportive of true pedagogical excellence and</p>
<p>high Student achievement.</p>
<p>What are we to do? Among the changes I advocate are</p>
<p>these:</p>
<p>e A return to a truly liberal education--one based on early achievement and constant practice of the three R's. This will result in the ability to read intelligently, think precisely, speak fluently, and write clearly. To this end, ‘mandatory academic courses must be given priority over electives. Intellectual discipline and hard work must be cultivated as indispensible to the achievement of true intellectual competence. Finally, academic excellence should be rewarded and celebrated at the expense of</p>
<p>sports programs and other non-academic pursuits,</p>
<p>e The establishment of a nationwide system of standardized performance examinations throughout the student's school years. Schools should promote and reward students on the basis of demonstrated achievement alone. Rigorous performance testing must be frequent. This would ensure that parents, teachers, and students have constant, accurate knowledge of childrens' absolute and relative academic standing. SAT exams toward the end of high school are too late to do much good.</p>
<p>@ Pay teachers more, but only in return for higher standards in teacher training, recruitment, and measured on-the-job performance.</p>
<p>e Aside from the critical importance of parental interest in education, the most important step is to ensure that children are taught by competent teachers to assure that they are well ecucated. Drastic improvements are needed. We must start by attracting the best teachers and thereafter rewarding them differentially on the basis of achieving excellence in ecademic</p>
<p>performance. ‘</p>
<p>a 2s Oo</p>
<p>The Modesto, California school system provides an example of what can be done to improve educational accomplishment dramtically. In that system, the average rise in verbal and math SAT scores was on the order of 20-30 points in but two years. So too, state-mandated competence levels were achieved by virtually all seniors (97%). All that was necessary was for them to '&quot;'...work hard for something they believe in than (to) enjoy a pampered idleness.&quot; Of course, Modesto's is but one example of successful reform; there are others also. The point to be made here is that we must examine successful reforms and follow their lead rather than simply inventing and implementing new theories. If we are to be realistically optimistic in effecting reforms, the interested parties must first reform themselves. Specifically: e Parents must assume personal responsibility for the education of their children. Turning this over to &quot;educational experts&quot; and other custodians will not suffice. @ The public must demand excellence in education and be willing to pay for it even if this requires eliminating sports and other non-academic programs. e Students must be convinced that it is they who are ultimately responsible for their education; that there — is no easy way, no short-cut to excellence; no magic wand that can produce the trained and disciplined minds they will need as adults. Many obstacles must be overcome to redress the errors of our educational system. From past experience, I am not optimistic.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we must keep trying. To do otherwise would be a</p>
<p>dereliction of duty by parents and by all of us, and will result in a degraded future for our children.</p>
<p>What might initially be obstacles to constructive change may, in fact, be an important source of the required solutions. I refer to the various segments that should be interested in education-- teachers, principals, school boards, students and--most importantly-- parents. They are the most important force in recognizing and redressing our educational decline. Without parental support and their informed and active participation demanding reform, little can be done. For, when the &quot;push comes to shove,&quot; it is primarily, and only parents who will possess the &quot;long-range&quot; view in accomplishing something enduring. The important potential and power of parents--their sacred duty--is to ensure the well-being of their children and their progeny. If they do not carry out this duty, no one else can be expected, as surrogate, to achieve the excellence which can be accomplished only by the well-educated.</p>
<p>I repeat: teachers must be properly rewarded. This will lead to high quality, constant improvement and true commitment. The low quality and morale of many teachers is due to poor training and a system of reward that runs counter to the ideals which would result in the intellectual excellence in their students. Teachers' unions, often motivated by selfish concerns, should make the good of their &quot;customers&quot;--our children--their principal objective. If they do so, they will have little difficulty reaching their monetary aims.</p>
<p>For their part, school boards, administrators, and principals</p>
<p>must become less independent politically and less timid of</p>
<p>charges of elitism, racism, and ethnocentrism. There is nothing undemocratic in excellence. Poor education, itself, is the insidious cause of an underclass of untaught, unemployable proletarians. Indeed, what we now have is an anti-elitist System which has the anti-democratic consequences of permanent incompetence and poverty.</p>
<p>School systems must be encouraged to develop excellent students to their full potential. In this way they serve themselves and act as examples of excellence for under-motivated, under-achieving and bored class-mates. Such comparison is not elitist or undemocratic. To the contrary, it results in great advantage for many who otherwise would not have known academic excellence or seen it achieved and rewarded.</p>
<p>Some cautions are in order:</p>
<p>e First, we must recognize that not every school can be excellent. Our goals will not be achieved by directing our attention to all students, regardless of motivation. Rather, I Suggest we concentrate on those schools and those teachers who already have the will to achieve excellence. ‘We must Support their efforts to the degree consistent with equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>The results will be there for all to see--and will act as a comparison and stimulation for the under-achievers. Guarantee equality of opportunity, but support those who work to excel;</p>
<p>this will inspire others.</p>
<p>.@ Second, we must learn from the better educational performance</p>
<p>of other countries. But here our heterogeneity is in contrast with the cultural homogeneity of European countries and Japan. We</p>
<p>must maintain and extend our classless society and its promise of</p>
<p>upward mobility through achievement stemming from opportunity.</p>
<p>e Finally, we must not allow reforms, local or</p>
<p>national, to be co-opted by doctrinaire ideologists--conservative, liberal, or populist--who would politicize curricular and other reforms and subordinate them to the inculcation of partisan doctrine or privilege.</p>
<p>We know what needs to be done; we know the national importance of achieving this. But institutions and experts alone can not make these things happen.</p>
<p>It is parents who must decide the kind and level of excellence to demand in education. And for parents to settle for anything short of realizing the highest degree of our children's potential is to sell their birthright for a mess of parental self-indulgent potage.</p>
<p>Nations can prevail or decline; only individuals can experience the achievement of excellence. And only as individuals will we suffer the consequences of failing to establish the basis</p>
<p>for that excellence which comes from educational achievement.</p>
