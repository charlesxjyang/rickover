      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his remarks accepting the Christopher Columbus Award on October 10, 1964, Admiral H. G. Rickover humbly deflects personal credit, emphasizing that scientific and engineering progress, like nuclear ship propulsion, results from the collective efforts of many, including his own organization and an &quot;international honor roll&quot; of scientists such as Enrico Fermi. He articulates a core theme of Western civilization as a &quot;common pool&quot; of knowledge, highlighting its deep historical unity (traced from ancient Greece and the Roman Empire through the *Respublica Christiana*), asserting that its defining characteristic is a &quot;restless spirit of venturesome inquiry&quot; that relentlessly pushes boundaries despite inherent resistance to change. Rickover draws a powerful parallel to Christopher Columbus, portraying him as the quintessential embodiment of this courageous and persistent spirit, which is essential to overcome obstacles and advance human knowledge, ultimately deeming the &quot;price&quot; of progress &quot;worth it.&quot;</p>

        <p>FOR RELEASE 6:00 PM (EST)<br>SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1964 —</p>
<p>Remarks Prepared by Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S.N<br>--on the Oteasion of Receipt<br>off the<br>Christopher Columbus Award<br>. Golumbus, Ohio<br>October 10, 1964</p>
<p>IT am highly honored to have peen chosen for the Christopher Columbus<br>Award, which I gratefully accept.<br>I am fully conscious that in an engineering project such as that</p>
<p>of developing nuclear ship propulsion, success is never due to the labors</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>of a single man. There must, of course, be someone to direct; but<br>success depends as much on the faithful work. of everyone concerned in<br>the project as on the man who heads 4t. I feel strongly that the |<br>Christopher Columbus Award belongs jointly to all the men and women of<br>my organization without whose steadfast devotion and hard work we would<br>not now have in operation the nuclear ships which constitute a major<br>deterrent to an attack against our country.<br>Yet even this group cannot truly claim credit for the development<br>of nuclear propulsion. Our “work could not have been done without the.<br>theoretical groundwork laid by many men from many lands --an international</p>
<p>honor roll of scientists trained in European and American universities.</p>
<p>These men of diverse national origins laid the foundations of our present</p>
<p>Copyright 1964, H. G. Rickover.<br>No permission needed for newspaper or news periodical use.<br>Above copyright notice to be used 4f most of speech reprinted.</p>
<p>anowledge of nuclear fission; among them an Italian of beloved memory<br>who came to the United States to help in our war effort--Enrico. Fermi.</p>
<p>Truly, no country can claim national self-sufficiency in the fields<br>of science and engineering. We each drink from the common pool and<br>sometimes contribute a little to it.</p>
<p>It ig often said in the United States that the earliest English<br>settlers who came to our shores brought with them the great body of<br>English Common Law and Legal Procedure which remains the basis of<br>American jurisprudence to this day. With equal justice, we can say that<br>each European who followed Columbus across the Atlantic to found a new<br>American family carried with him the great treasure of European<br>civilization which today belongs to us of the New World as much as it<br>does to those of the Old. That these men from every corner of Europe<br>found it possible to live together in peace and to build a strong country<br>with great internal cohesion is not surprising when we remember that what<br>they had in common was so much more significant than what divided them.</p>
<p>They had in common 4 thousand-year tradition of religious, moral,<br>social, and cultural unity, going back to Greece, the Roman Empire and</p>
<p>the Medieval Respublica Christiana. For until the end of the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>Europe had been as one 4n the fundamentals of life, in everything that<br>4s truly important. Educated men even spoke the same language.</p>
<p>Today many international meetings are held; all require instantaneous<br>translation service so that the participants can understand what is being<br>said. As you know this is the way United Nations&#x27; meetings are conducted.</p>
<p>But in the days of Christopher Columbus there was no need for such</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>wanslation; we should have all conversed with ease in Latin, learned<br>from the same textbooks, by the same teaching methods, in the same sort<br>of grammar schools.</p>
<p>Against this deep basic unity, what divided the European settlers<br>who came to America was relatively unimportant --their separation: by the<br>political poundaries of the modern nation states. In the long span of<br>European history these poundaries were of fairly recent origin, going<br>pack only to the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries when the sovereign<br>states of Europe obtained their independence. The diversity of Europe<br>was superimposed on her age-old unity. When the European settlers came<br>to America the political parriers dividing them were left pehind, and<br>the ties of their common European civilization reasserted themselves.<br>Thus we have been able to build a4 new civilization closely related to<br>that of Europe, if different in some outward manifestations.</p>
<p>Tf I were asked to pick the one most significant aspect of our<br>common Western civilization which most distinguishes 4t from other great<br>-eultures I should, I think, choose the freedom 4% accords the human<br>spirit to Anquire 4nto the unknown, to experiment, to improve and to<br>change. It is this restless spirit of venturesome inquiry which has<br>prought about. the seientific and technical achievements of today.</p>
<p>Most men are conservative and resist unknown ovens which threaten<br>to upset the even tenor of accustomed ways of life. In some cultures<br>this mental laziness has been elevated into 4 civic virtue. Tradition<br>reigns supreme: and the few of venturesome spirit are put into a strait</p>
<p>jacket. In the West, the venturous have never peen wholly stifled by</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>rpadition, though at times inquiry was frowned upon by the authorities.</p>
<p>oner or later, freedom to inquire. re-established 4tself--not without<br>opposition, of course. Western men, too, cling to the familiar and<br>accustomed ; entrenched interests fight 4nnovations threatening their<br>privileges. No discovery 18 prought forth, no 4nnovation is carried<br>through without great effort and single-minded obstinacy. Everything |<br>new endangers something old. A new machine replaces human hands; a new<br>source of power threatens old businesses; 2 new trade route wipes out<br>the supremacy of old ports and prings prosperity to new ones. This is<br>the price which must be paid for progress and it is worth it. Let us<br>never stifle man&#x27;s urge to push outward the boundaries of knowledge or<br>Western civilization will stagnate and die.</p>
<p>Among the great Europeans who have helped widen knowledge, few can<br>equal Christopher Columbus in firmness of purpose, patient persistence<br>in the face of petty obstruction and neartbreaking disappointments, and<br>courage in the face of unknown danger. For ten long years he labored<br>to win recognition and support for nis daring project. All he needed<br>was financial support; he; himself, took all the chances . Because he<br>succeeded we in America honor his name each year on the 12th of October.<br>It is most fitting that Columbus, Ohio should honor her 4llustrious<br>namesake. To receive the award: granted in: his name 45 a most -</p>
<p>heartwarming and gratifying event. I thank you.</p>
