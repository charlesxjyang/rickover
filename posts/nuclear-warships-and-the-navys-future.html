      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s 1974 article forcefully advocates for a fully nuclear-powered U.S. Navy, framing it as a national security imperative against the backdrop of oil vulnerability and a growing Soviet naval threat. He laments the slow adoption of nuclear propulsion, noting that only two nuclear-powered surface combatants joined the fleet in the decade following the 1964 &quot;Sea Orbit&quot; circumnavigation, a delay he attributes to deeply entrenched Navy &quot;inertia&quot; and cost-centric arguments. Rickover counters these objections by detailing the operational superiority of nuclear ships—highlighted by the Truxtun&#x27;s 8,600-mile independent voyage and the *Nimitz* carrier&#x27;s nuclear fuel equivalence to 11 million barrels of oil—and arguing that their lifetime cost is only marginally higher (e.g., a nuclear task group is 6% more). Crucially, he points to congressional action, including the landmark Public Law 93-365 (TITLE VIII-NUCLEAR POWERED NAVY) of August 1974, as essential in mandating this modernization, drawing historical parallels to past naval transitions (sail to steam, coal to oil) where progress was similarly resisted before becoming undeniable.</p>

<p>=<br>&lt; ¢</p>
<p>By Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy</p>
<p>As the Navy’s three nuclear-powered surface<br>ships, right, cruised in the Mediterranean<br>during their 30,000-mile circumnavigation in<br>August 1964, they were clearly tomorrow’s<br>warships. But tomorrow and tomorrow and<br>tomorrow have passed and, in the ten years<br>between Operation Sea Orbit and the approval<br>of the legislation on the facing page, only two<br>nuclear-powered surface combatants have</p>
<p>joined the fleet.</p>
<p>Much has been said in recent months about the<br>importance of naval power as it relates to contemporary<br>international relations. For a country that is essentially<br>an island nation, whose economic life is increasingly<br>dependent on foreign resources, and the majority of<br>whose allies are oceans away, the emergence of wide-<br>spread national interest in our naval posture is long<br>overdue.</p>
<p>Several important events are making clear the in-<br>escapable reality of our dependence on naval power.<br>Among these are the national retrenchment following<br>the long war in Southeast Asia, the development of<br>a strong Soviet Navy, with warships particularly de-<br>signed to destroy U.S. naval forces, and most recently,<br>the Arab-Israeli conflict, with the resultant loss of oil<br>supplies from the Mid-East.</p>
<p>The current lack of foreign oil has reminded us of<br>our vulnerability to outside pressures. It has not been</p>

<p>easy for our citizens to accept the fact that this country<br>is dependent on anyone or anything. Americans are<br>proud of their self-reliance and self-sufficiency. That<br>something as simple as heating a house or driving a<br>car can be governed by conditions beyond national or<br>individual control is for most of us a painful revelation,<br>The smoothest generalizations are breaking up against<br>the rough edges of recent events.</p>
<p>So far, the oil shortage has only been an incon-<br>venience to the majority of our people. But a shortage<br>of petroleum could have disastrous results on the ability<br>of our oil-fired naval forces to fight in areas where fuel<br>supplies are unavailable to us. This does not have to<br>continue to be the case for future major U.S. naval<br>combatants because we can build them with nuclear<br>propulsion, if we exercise the foresight to do so.</p>
<p>With existing designs of naval nuclear propulsion<br>plants it is possible to provide enough energy for ten<br>to 13 years of ship operation without the need to refuel.<br>And new reactor designs now under development will<br>last 15 years. In contrast, oil-fired naval warships must<br>be refueled every few days. The initial nuclear fuel for<br>a Nimitz class aircraft carrier contains the energy equiv-<br>alent of 11 million barrels of Navy distillate fuel oil,<br>or enough oil to fill a train of railway tank cars, stretch-<br>ing from San Francisco to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>It was the concern for fuel for naval ships in time<br>of war that led to establishment of the Naval Oil<br>Reserves, which are now being considered as a quick<br>source of additional oil during the present shortage.<br>But even if this reserve is still available during a future<br>war, it will also be necessary to have the oil at hand<br>where it is needed, before it can be used. Of what value<br>is an oil-fired warship if it is unable to get oil? It is<br>the need for a reliable worldwide fuel distribution<br>system, that is the Achilles’ heel of our oil-fired Navy.<br>The difficulty in obtaining foreign oil supplies to sup-<br>port recent operations in the Mediterranean and the<br>Indian Ocean shows this vulnerability.</p>
<p>But from the very beginning of the nuclear power<br>program there has been strong opposition in the Navy.<br>Were it not for the Congress and the Atomic Energy<br>€ommission, we would not have nuclear submarines.<br>In 1948, when the Navy opposed nuclear submarines,<br>the Navy’s systems analysts made a study. This study<br>showed that a nuclear submarine would be worth 1.41<br>times as much as a conventional submarine, but would<br>cost about twice as much. The analysts therefore con-<br>cluded that nuclear power was not worthwhile. The<br>Navy argued that if they built nuclear submarines they<br>would only get half as many submarines each year. This<br>argument was similar to a view held by the Navy at<br>the end of the 19th century. President Theodore Roose-<br>velt said that the Navy feared to push submarines lest</p>
<p>Congress withhold appropriations for building battle-<br>ships. Fortunately, in the case of nuclear power, Con-<br>gress prevailed and the Nawtilus was built. In fact, the<br>Atomic Energy Commission paid for the propulsion<br>plants of the first two nuclear submarines. The Nautilus<br>ushered in a revolution in submarine and naval warfare.</p>
<p>Although nuclear submarines have now been recog-<br>nized as among the most vital warships we have, oppo-<br>sition to them has nevertheless continued for over a<br>quarter of a century. For example, the Department of<br>Defense at one point decided to stop building any more<br>nuclear submarines after 1970, but they were overruled<br>by Congress. In another case, just a few years ago, the<br>systems analysts in the Defense Department suggested<br>sinking ten of our Polaris submarines to save money.<br>And, more recently, it had to be congressional action<br>that increased the number of high speed Los Angeles<br>class nuclear attack submarines in the shipbuilding<br>program over what the Defense Department had re-<br>quested. Such a reluctance to build submarines has<br>continued even though the Soviets have surpassed us<br>in numbers of nuclear submarines since 1971 and are<br>outbuilding us by three to one; and even though they<br>now possess three times our submarine building capac-<br>ity and are still increasing that capacity; and even<br>though they have introduced nine new designs in the<br>past seven years as compared to two for us.</p>
<p>In nuclear powered surface warships, the opposition<br>has been even more persistent. The five nuclear surface<br>ships in service today came into being only after much<br>pushing and shoving by Congress. The aircraft carrier</p>
<p>“But from the very beginning of the</p>
<p>nuclear power program there has been<br>strong opposition in the Navy. Were it<br>not for the Congress and the Atomic</p>
<p>Energy Commission, we would not have</p>
<p>Kennedy was built with conventional power over the<br>strong objection of Congress. One of the two nuclear-<br>powered frigates which were authorized by Congress _<br>in fiscal year 1968 was not permitted to be built by<br>the Defense Department, and the other was delayed —<br>for nearly two years. In 1971, the Navy scrapped a</p>
<p>previously planned program to provide each nuclear:<br>powered carrier with its required four nuclear frigates,<br>and suspended indefinitely the nuclear frigate con-_<br>struction program. Yet this was the only type of new _</p>
<p>mbatant ship having a fleet air defense capability.<br>Central to the opposition to nuclear-powered ships<br>been the precept that we should not go to nuclear<br>ywer until we can show it is no more expensive than<br>nventional power. But why should we expect to get<br>(the advantages of nuclear power at no additional<br>? The cost of all other weapons has gone up as<br>capabilities have improved. For example, the M-16<br>fle costs three times as much as the World War II<br>1 cost; a modern machine gun costs nine times more<br>one from World War II; a C-5 transport plane is<br>r 300 times as expensive as the World War II C-47;<br>e airplanes the Navy flies today cost 20 to 25 times<br>‘much as World War II aircraft. Does that mean<br>should have only four or five planes on our carriers<br>ead of 100?<br>en so, the additional cost of nuclear powered<br>ips is minimal when all factors are considered.<br>nuclear powered ships are built to higher stand-<br>s than conventional ships and have proved to be<br>‘feliable in the operation of their propulsion<br>. These first line ships carry the most modern and<br>weapons systems and have increased opera-<br>capabilities over their conventional counter-<br>—all of which naturally contribute to their higher<br>I cost. In addition, the construction cost of nuclear<br>includes nuclear fuel for over ten to thirteen years<br>ation, whereas the initial cost of a conventional<br>d ship does not include the cost for oil.<br>ently, oil costs have: risen dramatically. It now<br>lose to $25 a barrel to buy and deliver oil to<br>y ships. At that rate, it would cost almost $270<br>fon to provide the amount of oil for a conven-</p>
<p>y powered carrier equivalent to the nuclear fuel<br>Nimitz, That is almost three times the cost of<br>clear fuel for this ship.<br>lear and conventional ship costs should be com-<br>sd on a lifetime basis. For example, compare lifetime<br>a nuclear carrier task group with those of a<br>nal task group. The nuclear carrier increases<br>group cost about two percent. Each nuclear<br>creases the overall task group cost one percent,<br>four nuclear escorts increase the task group cost<br>ent. Therefore, the lifetime cost for a complete<br>task group, consisting of a nuclear carrier and<br>nuclear escorts, is six percent greater than that<br>entional carrier accompanied by four conven-<br>orts.<br>merely the peacetime cost. It does not take<br>int any of the advantages of nuclear power.<br>-powered task forces are far less dependent<br>support. When logistic supply lines are<br>d during a real war the decrease in the require-<br>hips’ fuel for the strike forces will have a</p>
<p>Nuclear Warships and the Navy&#x27;s Future 21</p>
<p>compounding beneficial effect. The surviving fuel<br>transportation and storage facilities can then all be<br>concentrated on getting fuel for aircraft and other<br>military vehicles to the forward areas. The escorts that<br>would otherwise be required for the tankers which carry<br>ships’ fuel could then be assigned to assuring the safety<br>of other supplies.</p>
<p>A major lesson of World War I, the first war in<br>which fuel oil played a predominant role, was pithily<br>expressed: “The Allies floated to victory on a sea of<br>oil.” In World War II also, the supply of oil was a<br>controlling factor in most military operations.</p>
<p>Here is a statement about fuel, that points out how<br>lack of oil was instrumental in the defeat of Japan.<br>It is quoted from the Strategic Bombing Survey con-<br>ducted after the war. This report, entitled “Oil in<br>Japan’s War,” states:</p>
<p>“In every phase of the war, oil determined Japan’s<br>strategy and governed the tactical operations of its<br>Navy and Air Force. The collapse of the Japanese<br>war effort was the consequence of their inability to<br>maintain their supply routes.</p>
<p>“The effect of oil shortage on Japanese Naval<br>strategy became devastatingly apparent in the cam-<br>paign for the Marianas and the Philippines. Japanese<br>fleet units had to be dispersed between the Japanese<br>Inland Sea and Singapore, owing to limited fuel-<br>ing facilities, and failure to achieve satisfactory coor-<br>dination between the fleets contributed substantially<br>to the Japanese defeat. Fuel shortage in the Home<br>Islands deprived the Japanese naval forces fighting<br>off the Philippines of the services of at least three<br>battleships, which together with several aircraft car-<br>riers were taken out of service and assigned to duties<br>as port and antiaircraft vessels because they con-<br>sumed too much oil.”</p>
<p>There are numerous examples where oil shortages<br>have been a critical factor in military operations, exam-<br>ples that appear now to have been forgotten. Unfortu-<br>nately, history has a way of taking revenge for forget-<br>fulness.</p>
<p>Take the carrier task force again. In the case of a<br>conventional carrier with four conventional escorts, one<br>third of the fuel is used for the carrier, one third for -<br>the conventional escorts, and one third for the aircraft.<br>By doing away with the need for the fuel for the carrier<br>and its escorts; by making them nuclear powered; only<br>one third the’ amount of propulsion fuel—that used<br>by the aircraft—is needed. Further, we design our nu-<br>clear carriers with the capacity for almost twice as much<br>aircraft fuel and 50% more aircraft ammunition than<br>the latest conventional carrier. This reduction in logis-<br>tic support becomes especially important when our</p>
<p>22 U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings, January 1975</p>
<p>naval forces are operating away from home, during a<br>real war, when they are subject to enemy attack.</p>
<p>When a nuclear carrier is substituted for a conven-<br>tional carrier, the range of a carrier task group with<br>four conventional escorts is doubled. When two of the<br>four escorts with the nuclear carrier are nuclear, the<br>range of the carrier task group is doubled again. When<br>all the escorts are nuclear, the range of the carrier task<br>group is essentially unlimited.</p>
<p>For these reasons a nuclear task force is at least 50%<br>more effective than a conventional task force.</p>
<p>I am sure you know the maxim learned through<br>the bitter lessons of war that: “The art of war is the<br>art of the logistically feasible.” It is the elimination<br>of the requirement for a continuous supply of pro-<br>pulsion fuel that makes nuclear-powered warships so<br>valuable.</p>
<p>The areas I have just mentioned represent a tremen-<br>dous increase in military effectiveness. In my opinion,<br>this effectiveness far outweighs the six percent higher<br>lifetime cost for the all-nuclear carrier task force.</p>
<p>There are many examples where the value of nuclear<br>propulsion for surface warships has been demonstrated<br>in real terms, in everyday operational missions of the<br>Fleet. I frequently receive letters from the commanding<br>officers of our nuclear warships telling me of some of<br>these advantages. As one of many examples, for 13 days<br>during July 1971, the Trwxtun—the frigate that Con-<br>gress changed to nuclear propulsion in the 1962 pro-<br>gtam—provided an excellent demonstration of the ca-<br>pability of a nuclear-powered ship to perform truly<br>independent missions, free of the fuel oil umbilical<br>cord.</p>
<p>While on a special mission, the Truxtun steamed<br>8,600 miles at an average speed of advance of 28 knots,<br>traveling from Subic Bay in the Philippines to Perth,<br>Australia, and crossing the Indian Ocean twice en<br>route. This is the longest period of such high-speed<br>operation ever sustained by any ship. This high speed<br>could have been continued for an essentially indefinite<br>period, had there been a need. At the conclusion of<br>her mission, the Truxtun was fully ready to undertake<br>protracted combat operations.</p>
<p>In contrast, our most modern oil-fired frigate would<br>have had to refuel at least three times during such a<br>transit, and would have arrived at her destination with<br>close to minimum fuel reserves, unable to conduct<br>extended combat operations. And, of course, there are<br>no tankers normally available in the middle of the<br>Indian Ocean from which to refuel. From a practical<br>standpoint, no non-nuclear ship could have performed<br>the Truxtun’s mission—in peace or in war—because of<br>the fuel support needed.</p>
<p>Also to be considered in comparing nuclear-powered</p>
<p>to conventionally powered ships is the availability of<br>fuel reserves during war. I mentioned that the Naval<br>Oil Reserves are now being considered as an emer<br>gency source of fuel. These reserves are, therefore, not<br>guaranteed,</p>
<p>The situation is different when we have nuclear fuel<br>as a reserve. What limited our industrial output, and —<br>therefore our fighting capacity in World War II was—<br>the labor supply. But we can employ labor now—in<br>peacetime—to manufacture nuclear fuel for our nuclear —</p>
<p>Navy, and we can store the fuel in a small area. We<br>would then be assured of having a nuclear fuel reserve<br>for a long war, and we would not need labor, during<br>the war, to manufacture nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>There are events in a nation’s history that, to use<br>Thomas Jefferson’s phrase, are like “a fire bell in the<br>night.” The recent conflict in the Mid-East was such<br>an event. For the first time, we were in a situation<br>where the Soviet Fleet in the Mediterranean out-<br>numbered the U.S. Sixth Fleet.</p>
<p>Had the Soviet Mediterranean Fleet been ordered to<br>challenge the Sixth Fleet, who would have won? From<br>the limited information available to me, I do not think<br>the answer is entirely clear. Would such a question have<br>been seriously asked ten years ago? Perhaps this thought<br>will give you an inkling of the change that has taken<br>place in the balance of naval power over the past<br>decade.</p>
<p>This change underscores the urgent need we, as an<br>island nation, have to build a Navy strong enough to<br>protect our national interests, and our economic and<br>political survival. To me, it is clear that the striking<br>force ships we build for such a Navy must have nuclear<br>power.</p>
<p>Yet, despite its demonstrated superiority, there is no<br>firm long-range building program to convert our major<br>combatant forces to nuclear power.</p>
<p>I suppose that, to some people, any rate of transition<br>to nuclear power, or to any other new weapon, is<br>unreasonable. But many have taken a stand against<br>nuclear power for the Navy before they even investi-<br>gated it. Their tendency has been to fit facts into their</p>
<p>_ preconceptions. They have failed to see that the essence<br>of all progress is a shedding of preconceived ideas and<br>_ accustomed ways of doing things. In the past, this<br>&quot;failure has prolonged military ideas beyond their time.<br>j Changes in the Navy often come at a distressingly<br>slow pace. It took two-thirds of a century for our Navy<br>to change from sail to steam. In 1814, Robert Fulton<br>designed and built for our Navy the world’s first<br>_ warship propelled by steam. It was named Demologos.<br>&quot; Over the next 20 years the United States built some<br>700 steam merchantmen while the U.S. Navy built<br>&quot; only one steam vessel.<br>It might interest you to know that in 1869, 55 years<br>; after the Demologos, the Navy Department issued a<br>General Order requiring all warships to carry a full set<br>&quot;of sails. The concern over cost was so great that specific<br>tructions were issued as to when the steam engines<br>uld be run. The order warned naval commanders<br>hat: “They must not be surprised, if they fail to carry<br>ut the spirit of this order, if the coal consumed is<br>charged to their account.”<br>_ After conversion to steam had become a reality we<br>“went through another period when there was great<br>&quot;reluctance to shift from coal to oil. At the beginning<br>the 20th century it was generally accepted that<br>fired warships offered substantial military advantages<br>ver coal-fired warships. But since they were more<br>xpensive, there was great resistance to building them.<br>took Winston Churchill’s command decision as First<br>Lord to give Britain’s Royal Navy the position of<br>orld leadership in converting warships from coal to<br>As it later turned out, this was a significant factor<br>n Britain’s naval superiority in World War I. Churchill<br>aid:</p>
<p>’ “Shocked at the expense, the Admiralty had reverted<br>gy two years to 27-knot coal-burning flotillas. It was<br>too late to stop the last bevy of these inferior vessels,<br>&quot;but I gave directions to design the new flotilla to</p>
<p>realize 35 knots speed without giving up anything</p>
<p>_ in gunpower, torpedoes or seaworthiness. Build slow<br>destroyers?’ One might as well breed slow race</p>
<p>horses!”</p>
<p>When one talks about the delay by the Navy in<br>from sail to coal, or from coal to oil, everyone</p>
<p>y agrees that those responsible were stupid not to</p>
<p>e the change faster. As Goethe said: “It is the truth,<br>not for us.” With hindsight they can easily see<br>ps their predecessors fell into, but they cannot</p>
<p>¢ that a generation hence they themselves will</p>
<p>ed along with the other shortsighted leaders<br>tefused to go from sail to coal, and from coal</p>
<p>tia seems to be endemic to naval development.</p>
<p>Nuclear Warships and the Navy’s Future 23</p>
<p>Curiously, the lethargy is most often felt by the nation<br>which has the greatest navy. On 4 March 1858, the<br>French, on one day, laid the keels of three frigates.<br>These ships were to have iron plates bolted to their<br>sides to protect them against shot and shell—they<br>would be far better than anything the more powerful<br>British Navy possessed. In June of that year a high<br>British naval official reluctantly admitted that his coun-<br>try had to accept the challenge. He said:</p>
<p>“Although I have frequently stated it is not in<br>the interest of Great Britain, possessing as she does<br>so large a navy, to adopt any important change in<br>the construction of ships of war which might have<br>the effect of rendering necessary the introduction of<br>a new class of very costly vessels until such a course<br>is forced upon her by the adoption by foreign powers<br>of formidable ships of a novel character requiring<br>similar ships to cope with them, yet it then becomes<br>a matter not only of expediency but of absolute<br>necessity.”</p>
<p>Half a century later, however, another responsible<br>British official argued that his country was wrong to<br>build the Dreadnought—the all big-gun battleship<br>which made all other battleships obsolete. He said:<br>Britain “ought never to lead in ship construction, but<br>always to follow with something better.”</p>
<p>For a leading navy such an attitude appears to have<br>some merit. It coincides with all the natural instincts<br>to preserve a familiar and comfortable way of life—a<br>way which recalls hard-won victories of the past. Also,<br>this attitude can be defended upon economic grounds</p>
<p>because it keeps costs down by preserving existing<br>ships, equipment, and naval skills. But development<br>never ends. To believe that advances can be deferred<br>and that a nation can make up lost ground can be<br>fatal. Such a cast of thought is what Mahan recognized<br>when he wrote: “Finality never will be reached in<br>anything save death... .”</p>
<p>In each of the instances I have mentioned, change<br>was demanded of an organization; change in leadership<br>and in training. The fault was inertia—a comfortable</p>
<p>24 U. S. Naval Institute Proceedings, January 1975</p>
<p>faith that lessons and ways of the past will hold in<br>the trials of the future. In its broadest sense this is<br>an undemanding mental attitude which is opposed to<br>change. It is a vested interest.</p>
<p>Those outside the professional ranks, such as the<br>Press, citizens, and Congress can recognize the danger<br>of such blindness—if they but know the facts,</p>
<p>You might properly ask why I, an engineer, am the<br>spokesman for nuclear warships. The answer is that<br>there are two roads which must be traveled to accom-<br>plish change in our military: the road of action and<br>the road of words. I would prefer to devote my energies<br>entirely to engineering. But since no one in the Navy<br>was devoting his effort to the words, I was forced to<br>do both. This was true in 1946; it is still true today.<br>Perhaps, by the next century, the Navy itself will finally<br>realize the importance of nuclear power, but this is not<br>yet the case. It should have come in the 1950s. This<br>is a sad commentary on the lack of foresightedness of<br>all but a few of our naval leaders over the past quarter<br>century.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that we must—from the<br>standpoint of national safety—avoid proving again the<br>old adage that, “history repeats itself.” Congressional<br>concern in this regard has been clearly indicated by a<br>House Armed Services Subcommittee on the Middle<br>East. In its December 1973 report the Subcommittee<br>stated:</p>
<p>“The Committee on Armed Services has in the past<br>consistently urged nuclear propulsion for naval ves-<br>sels because of its operational advantages—the virtu-<br>ally unlimited range such power gives a ship. Now<br>nuclear propulsion has become a must because of<br>logistic realities. In addition to the danger of a<br>shortage of oil for ships, the rising cost of oil, when<br>available, has made scrap Paper out of past compara-<br>tive cost estimates for nuclear and conventional</p>
<p>power.<br>“The wisdom of the committee’s Past position has<br>been borne out by time, and the committee should<br>question carefully the construction of further oil-<br>powered ships where the technology exists to make<br>them nuclear-powered.”</p>
<p>What must be done? We need a permanent program<br>to build nuclear-powered ships—a program that will<br>not be drastically changed every year or two as has<br>happened in the past. Admiral Mooter, former Chait-<br>man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and for many years<br>an eloquent proponent of nuclear power for our strik-<br>ing forces, agrees with me that we must build these<br>first line ships during peace.</p>
<p>The excuse for not building better ships is always<br>that they are “more expensive.” But all weapons of<br>wart are expensive. Cheap weapons will not win us a<br>war. And if we cannot win a war, there is no sense<br>in spending money on weapons at all.</p>
<p>Rarely in naval history have the leaders looked far<br>enough ahead. They generally build ships that they<br>consider to be adequate for the present. That is why,<br>frequently, naval leadership has been replaced when war<br>broke out.</p>
<p>We should be planning now for war that may erupt<br>15 or more years from now. Therefore, it is time to<br>establish a firm program for making all new major<br>combatant ships for our striking forces nuclear-<br>powered. It is a matter of national priority.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover graduated from the U.S, Naval Academy in 1922. He<br>had consecutive duty on the USS La Vallette and the USS Nevada until<br>April 1927. In December 1929, he received the degree of Master of Science<br>in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University. Between 1930 and 1933<br>he served on board the USS 5.9 and USS S-48, becoming qualified to<br>command submarines in August 1931. From July 1933 until April 1935<br>he was attached to the Office of the Inspector of Naval Material, Phila-<br>delphia. Service as Engineering Officer aboard the battleship New Mexico<br>followed. In the fall of 1937, he assumed command of the USS Finch on<br>the Asiatic Station, Upon selection for Engineering Duty, he was transferred<br>to the Navy Yard, Cavite, Philippine Islands, serving there until June 1939,<br>In August 1939, he reported to BuShips, later serving as Head of the<br>Electrical Section there. In 1945 he was assigned as Industrial Manager,<br>Okinawa, with further duty as CO of the Naval Repair Base, Okinawa<br>where he was in charge of building the base and facilities. In December<br>1945, he reported as Inspector General, Nineteenth Fleet, with headquarters<br>at San Francisco, California, remaining there until May 1946 when he was<br>assigned to the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. From September<br>1947 to February 1949, he had duty in connection with nuclear ship propul-<br>sion at BuShips. He next reported for duty with the Division of Reactor<br>Development of the A.E.C. with additional duty at BuShips. Admiral<br>Rickover is now the Director, Division of Naval Reactors, U.S. Atomic<br>Energy Commission, and Deputy Commander for Nuclear Propulsion, Naval<br>Sea Systems Command,</p>
