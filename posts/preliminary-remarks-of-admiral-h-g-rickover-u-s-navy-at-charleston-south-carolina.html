<p>Preliminary Remarks of<br>Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy<br>at Charleston, South Carolina<br>13 October 1978</p>
<p>I am glad to be here with the Charleston Council of the Navy League<br>on the 203rd anniversary of the United States Navy. I would like first to<br>Say a few words about your Senators—two of our most highly regarded and<br>respected members of the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Strom Thurmond has served as well in defense of our country as in<br>Congress, On the day war was declared against Germany in 1941, he<br>volunteered for the Army. He was a paratrooper in the Normandy invasion.<br>Before Germany surrendered, he had earned five battle stars and eighteen<br>decorations, medals, and awards, including the Legion of Merit with Oak<br>Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with combat &quot;&quot;v&quot;, the Purple Heart, the |<br>Belgian Order of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre,</p>
<p>His accomplishments speak for themselves, He is a self-made man</p>
<p>who started from scratch. By hard work, strength of character, and inde-</p>
<p>pendence of mind, he attained the highest office in your State, serving as</p>
<p>torey</p>
<p>Governor from 1947 to 1951, Later, in the Senate, he worked his way up<br>to become one of its leading members.</p>
<p>He is a true gentleman, the best of the tradition, with a lifestyle<br>of grace and modesty that requires service, humor, and gentility. His }</p>
<p>values and standards are traditional and imbued with quality. He is forth-</p>
<p>topo -<br>[ae<br>A</p>
<p>right, outspoken in his convictions, strong in his faith and love of country,<br>and consistently speaks out and fights for what he believes to be true and<br>right. I admire him as one of our Nation&#x27;s leaders; he isamanIam ~“ ~</p>
<p>grateful to know as a friend.</p>
<p>Not many States can claim the honor of having two former Governors<br>representing them in continued political service as Senators.</p>
<p>Senator Hollings also saw combat in the Army during World War IL<br>After serving in the General Assembly and then the State&#x27;s House of Repre-<br>sentatives, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1954 and Governor in<br>1958. He was elected to the Senate in 1966,</p>
<p>In the many years that I have known Senator Hollings, he has earned<br>my admiration and respect, His experience on the Appropriations Com-<br>mittee has provided him with a unique vantage point to view our national<br>defense, He is a man dedicated to our country and to our people,</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to make some comments on our Commander in<br>Chief. The American people are more critical of those in high office today<br>than they have been in the past, and it is more important than ever that<br>high officials and the institutions in their charge set the moral tone for our<br>people, Yet, it is easier to point out the flaws and fallacies of a great man<br>than to be one. This attitude often reminds me of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s<br>&quot;Man in the Arena&quot; statement:</p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out</p>
<p>how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might |<br>have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is<br>actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and<br>dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes<br>short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the<br>great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement;<br>and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,<br>so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid</p>
<p>souls who know neither victory nor defeat,</p>
<p>It takes a great man to stand alone in the &quot;Arena&quot; that is the Office<br>of the Presidency, and President Carter is such a man, He has the<br>patience, the courage, and the quiet authority that enables him to strive<br>and solve the many issues and problems which confront him daily. He<br>brings a spiritual and practical philosophy to the awesome burden that is<br>his alone. And he has the experience, determination, and strength of<br>character, combined with high resolve and patriotism, to perform his<br>duties in the best interest of the United States,</p>
<p>President Carter is a leader who believes we must all accept<br>responsibility; we must all work to restore unity and purpose to the country,<br>so that, together, we can resolve the issues facing us, not only for ourselves</p>
<p>but for those who come after us.</p>
