      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address, delivered at the William J. Kroll Medal Presentation in Denver on March 21, 1975, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover highlights the critical journey of establishing zirconium as the essential structural material for U.S. nuclear reactors, both naval and civilian. He begins by commending Congressman Wayne Aspinall for his two decades of invaluable support in developing the nuclear Navy and for his prescient 1972 energy hearings. Rickover then details the challenges of nuclear propulsion, emphasizing the engineering judgment required to select and develop zirconium. He recounts the pivotal discovery in December 1947 by Dr. Kaufman and Dr. Pomerance that hafnium contamination caused zirconium&#x27;s neutron absorption, a problem solved by Kroll&#x27;s production process. Rickover describes his relentless fight against bureaucratic hurdles to secure zirconium production for early reactors like the Mark I and the NAUTILUS, overcoming initial high costs (over $300/lb in 1945) and the failure of Zircaloy-1 before successfully implementing Zircaloy-2 and later Zircaloy-4. He stresses the collaborative effort of &quot;scores of engineers and scientists,&quot; the importance of hands-on technical understanding, and his philosophy that &quot;the Devil is in the details, but so is salvation.&quot; The speech concludes by noting zirconium&#x27;s widespread adoption in 55 U.S. civilian nuclear power plants by March 1975, transforming the nation&#x27;s energy landscape and demonstrating the successful transfer of military technology to civilian use.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Remarks by<br>Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy<br>William J. Kroll Medal Presentation</p>
<p>Denver, Colorado</p>
<p>Friday, March 21, 1975</p>
<p>Iam particularly pleased that Congressman Wayne Aspinall is with<br>us tonight. I have known him for more than 20 years. During this time<br>he was a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy—the Committee<br>which has responsibility for all atomic matters, including the Naval Nuclear<br>Power Program. He was also on the House Interior Affairs Committee of<br>which he finally became the Chairman. In this position, he did much for<br>the mining industry.</p>
<p>During this entire time, he was courteous, pleasant, and helpful to<br>me. Without his help, and that of the members of the Joint Committee on<br>Atomic Energy, we would not now have the present nuclear Navy, which is<br>a most powerful force in keeping war away from our land. For an enemy<br>must know that, even if he were successful in a nuclear attack on our<br>country, he, himself, would inevitably be destroyed as long as our Polaris<br>missile submarines were on patrol.</p>
<p>It was always a pleasure and an inspiration to go to Congressman<br>Aspinall for his wise and kindly advice.</p>
<p>In 1972, before the present oil crisis, he held Hearings on the overall<br>energy problems of the United States. He invited me to testify before his</p>
<p>Committee. The Report of these Hearings are both a landmark and a</p>
<p>prophecy. He foresaw what would happen and the problems our Nation</p>
<p>‘would face if we did not act promptly. The recommendations he made</p>
<p>are as valid today as they were then. We should be grateful that men</p>
<p>such as Wayne Aspinall have served in our Congress.<br>I am proud to know him, happy to have him as a friend, and grateful</p>
<p>for his service to our country. 1</p>

<p>THE DECISION TO USE<br>ZIRCONIUM IN NUCLEAR REACTORS<br>Admiral H. G. Fickover, U.S. Navy<br>William J. Kroll Medal Presentation</p>
<p>Denver, Colorado<br>March 21, 1975</p>
<p>I am honored to be the first recipient of the William J. Kroll Medal<br>for Zirconium. It is gratifying because it gives me an opportunity to pay<br>tribute to an outstanding scientist.</p>
<p>I came to recognize his extraordinary qualities in the late 1940&#x27;s and<br>early 1950&#x27;s. At that time nuclear propulsion for naval ships was far from |<br>a reality. Those of us working on the project faced problems at e¥ery hand.<br>One of the most crucial was the development of a production process to<br>obtain zirconium, once the material was chosen for use in the nuclear reactor.<br>We did not know whether the metal could be produced in sufficient quantities,<br>or to the rigid specifications needed for naval reactors.</p>
<p>Dr. Kroll had worked on the development of a zirconium production<br>process at the Bureau of Mines facility at Albany, Oregon. I made several<br>trips to see the work being done at that facility to furnish zirconium for the<br>first naval reactors. Usually, Dr. Kroll, then a consultant to the Bureau of<br>Mines, and several senior officials of the Bureau of Mines met me at the<br>Portland airport on Friday evenings. We would drive to Albany, inspect<br>Copyright 1975, H. G. Rickover</p>

<p>the equipment, and discuss the results of the production effort then</p>
<p>underway. Dr. Kroll always gave me straightforward answers. He was a<br>scientist. Iamanengineer. Our common interest was zirconium. I<br>think we both understood the problems the other faced. I believe we had<br>this understanding because we based our discussion on principles.</p>
<p>Dr. Kroll was convinced that great advances in science came through<br>the efforts of individuals. He himself exemplified this philosophy. As he<br>wrote in 1955, his early work on zirconium was conducted at his laboratory<br>in Luxembourg where his only assistants were an unskilled laborer, a<br>mechanic, anda secretary. I also have found in my 57 years of naval<br>service that engineering problems are most often solved through the efforts<br>of technically competent individuals, not through the establishment of huge<br>organizations or management systems.</p>
<p>Tonight, { will talk about the decision to use zirconium and the<br>principles that lay behind that decision. Circumstances change, events<br>never repeat themselves exactly, but principles are long enduring. Much<br>of what I shall say will be my personal recollections. I recognize, however,<br>that without the zeal and hard work of scores of engineers and scientists<br>from several organizations, zirconium would not be—as it is today—the<br>major structural material in naval reactors, and in nearly all of the</p>
<p>reactors in central station power plants in the United States.</p>
<p>The Zirconium Decision</p>
<p>In June 1946, I headed a few officers and civilians the Navy had sent<br>to Oak Ridge. Our purpose was to see how nuclear energy could be used<br>to propel naval ships. It was obvious that a nuclear powered submarine<br>could revolutionize naval warfare. But a submarine nuclear propulsion<br>plant posed severe requirements. It had to. be compact,so that it would<br>fit into a submarine hull. It had to operate when the ship was rolling or<br>pitching, or at an angle when it was diving or surfacing. It had to be safe<br>and reliable. It had to be rugged to meet military demands, Finally, it<br>would have to be operated by young sailors—men who were not scientists<br>or engineers but who we would carefully train.</p>
<p>These are engineering problems. At Oak Ridge, we were dazzled<br>by the virtuosity of the scientists. They had accomplished much during the<br>war. But we soon discovered that scientists could give us only limited help.<br>The goal of the scientist is to discover the laws of nature. The engineer<br>uses and must obey those laws. The difference is fundamental. Theoretical<br>concepts are crucial to science, but they can have a dangerous and hypnotic<br>effect on the individuals who are responsible for practical results. The<br>engineer must seek out technical facts. He cannot run away from them,</p>
<p>The decision to use zirconium in a nuclear reactor is an example of<br>engineering judgment. During 1946 and 1947, several groups of scientists<br>and engineers were investigating metals for use in reactors. Zirconium<br>was one such metal. Stainless steel, aluminum, and beryllium were others.</p>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>The search was further complicated because several different types of</p>
<p>reactors were under study. One of the most promising of these approaches<br>for naval propulsion was the pressurized water reactor. However, for this<br>application, a structural metal was needed which would withstand corrosion<br>at high temperatures for long periods of time, which would maintain its<br>integrity in an environment of intense radiation, and which would not absorb<br>neutrons needed for the nuclear reaction. Furthermore, if the Navy was<br>to have a fleet of nuclear ships, the metal had to be one which could be<br>produced in quantity and at reasonable cost. Stainless steel, beryllium, and<br>aluminum all had technical disadvantages which weighed against their use.<br>Zirconium, too, did not look promising. Although its corrosion properties<br>appeared reasonable, it was expensive and had never been produced in quantity.<br>In 1945, only a few hundred pounds were manufactured in the United States<br>The cost was over $300 per pound. Above all, tests showed that zirconium<br>absorbed neutrons needed for the fission process.<br>This situation changed suddenly. While visiting Oak Ridge in December<br>1947, I learned that Dr. Kaufman of MIT and Dr. Pomerance of Oak Ridge<br>had just found that zirconium, as it occurred in nature, was combined with the<br>element hafnium, It was the hafnium,. at about 2 percent by weight, which gave<br>zirconium its high level of neutron absorption. They were able to remove<br>the hafnium in the laboratory and obtain zirconium which absorbed only a few<br>neutrons. This was a Scientific fact of great importance. Then and there, I<br>decided to choose zirconium for the naval reactor.</p>
<p>-4-</p>
<p>But the engineering problems were immense. At the time of this</p>
<p>| decision there was no assured source of zirconium, no estimate of how<br>much would be needed, no certainty that any known or conceivable process<br>could produce the required amount, and no specifications for the nuclear,<br>mechanical, or corrosion qualities the metal had to possess. It was also<br>possible that removing the hafnium could destroy the other qualities that<br>had made zirconium worth investigating in the first place.</p>
<p>The decision was a logical choice for the pressurized water propulsion<br>reactor. It was a risk, to be sure, but all development is a risk. Once the<br>decision was made, we did everything we could to reduce the uncertainty.<br>We did so by trying to find out what were the natural phenomena-—which is<br>only another way of saying that we were searching for technical facts. This<br>is the responsibility of engineering—its challenge—and its ethical content.<br>Several organizations helped us by conducting tests and performing analyses.<br>This sounds simple, but it took time to work out standards, so that the efforts<br>of one group could be compared with those of others. While research was<br>going on to determine the engineering properties of zirconium, Dr. Kroll<br>was working to improve the manufacturing processes so that zirconium<br>could be made at a low cost.</p>
<p>One reason for working on research and production simultaneously<br>was to save time. We urgently needed zirconium for two reactors. The<br>first was the Mark I, the land based prototype to be built in Idaho, to<br>demonstrate the feasibility of installing a compact pressurized water</p>
<p>-5-</p>
<p>reactor in a submarine. The second was the Mark II, which would propel</p>
<p>the NAUTILUS. But there was another reason. The reactor requirements<br>for the chemical purity of the metal influenced the development of the<br>production processes; what we learned in one area had an impact on the<br>other. We had to find out these relationships. As difficult as it was, in</p>
<p>the long run it was better and less wasteful to carry on both efforts together.<br>We were not thinking of only a few reactors, but of many nuclear ships.</p>
<p>One of the chief obstacles was administrative. I had no authority to<br>obtain production quantities of zirconium. The Atomic Energy Commission<br>and the Navy had established a joint organization in 1948 to develop nuclear<br>power for naval ships. I was the head of this effort. In 1949, Westinghouse<br>signed a contract and, after building a laboratory on the abandoned Bettis<br>airfield, near Pittsburgh, began work on the pressurized water reactor.<br>Soon we came up against a hard fact. The Bettis laboratory needed zirconium.<br>Procuring the metal was the responsibility of another organization of the<br>Atomic Energy Commission. The indication was that the Commission, by<br>following its procedures, could not procure zirconium on the schedule and<br>in the quantity needed. I urged the Commission to authorize Bettis to<br>manufacture zirconium for the Idaho reactor. The Commission overrode<br>my recommendation.</p>
<p>I objected strenuously. I had been assigned the job of developing a<br>nuclear submarine. The schedule called for having the ship ready for<br>operation by January 1955—-less than five years away. Zirconium at this</p>
<p>-6-</p>
<p>moment was crucial in the development of the reactor, Further, this</p>
<p>project was the only one committed to zirconium. The Commission was</p>
<p>thus violating the principle that authority must match responsibility. I had</p>
<p>been assigned the task, I knew the facts, but other people were determining</p>
<p>how my requirements should be met.</p>
<p>Certain factors were involved in the crisis, First, production<br>application of the Kroll process was still under development and had not<br>yet produced fully Satisfactory meta]. Therefore, we had to use the crystal<br>bar process which, at best, produced material of varying quality, In this<br>technique, bars were formed by deposition of a volatile zirconium compound<br>on a heated filament. The individual bars were small and expensive. The<br>Commission took the position that I Should wait until a less costly process<br>Was available.</p>
<p>The Commission plan to procure the zirconium from a commercia]<br>company failed. Asa result, Bettis in J uly 1950, was finally authorized<br>to build a crystal bar plant. Several organizations and facilities took part<br>in Supplying the zirconium needed for Processing at Bettis. In August,<br>the Commission transferred the authority to procure Zirconium to my own<br>organization. About 85 percent of the meta] used for the Mark | reactor</p>
<p>was made at Bettis, The rest came from industry Sources, The Successful</p>
<p>among them the use of Zirconium,</p>
<p>-7-</p>
<p>Developing Improved Zirconium Alloys</p>
<p>There still remained the job of developing a zirconium alloy which<br>would be cheaper to produce and would have less variability in corrosion<br>resistance. In this process, the Kroll technique would be the final production<br>step and eliminate the need for the crystal bar step, an important factor in<br>reducing costs. Test programs at Bettis and elsewhere examined the effects<br>of adding various elements to zirconium. Tin proved to be most beneficial.<br>A committee composed of men from several organizations, who had actually<br>worked on zirconium development, recommended an alloy, later called<br>zircaloy-1. This alloy contained 2. 5% tin and was used for the NAUTILUS<br>reactor.</p>
<p>This was not a gamble. We had by now an active and experienced<br>group of organizations capable of conducting tests and analyzing data. Even<br>as preparations began to manufacture zircaloy-1, we continued to test. By<br>1952, our data showed that zircaloy-1, in contrast to the usual behavior of<br>metals, had an increasing rate of corrosion over time. It was clear that we<br>could not use the alloy. Therefore, I stopped further processing of this<br>alloy and began an urgent search for a new one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Bettis already had underway an active program of<br>corrosion tests. These included the study of a number of zirconium base<br>alloys which contained other elements to obtain improved corrosion<br>resistance. Included was one ingot in which a small amount of stainless<br>steel had been accidentally added. The tests showed the beneficial effects<br>of iron, nickel, and chromium, which are contained in stainless steel.</p>
<p>-8-</p>
<p>This discovery was a good example of serendipity. But in another sense,</p>
<p>it was not really chance. A well-run project should be able to recognize<br>and take advantage of the unexpected.</p>
<p>Since the NAUTILUS was already under construction, I had to make<br>a decision immediately. On August 28, 1952, I went to Bettis and reviewed<br>the issue with scientists and metallurgists from Bettis and the Bureau of<br>Mines. I approved their recommendation to establish an alloy which we<br>subsequently called zircaloy-2. I selected it for the NAUTILUS reactor<br>before an ingot had ever been melted, fabricated, or tested for corrosion,</p>
<p>The decision was arisk. However, it was made only after careful<br>consideration of the recommendations made by those who were actually<br>involved in the work—-not by managers or administrators. The basic<br>composition of zircaloy selected that day in August 1952, has continued<br>to the present with only minor changes.</p>
<p>Bettis then began manufacturing zircaloy-2 for the NAUTILUS reactor.<br>That reactor generated power on December 30, 1954, just one day prior to<br>the date I had promised the Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy<br>five years earlier. In less than a month, on January 17, 1955, the<br>NAUTILUS got underway. This marked the inception of the era of naval<br>nuclear propulsion.</p>
<p>Development of zirconium, however, still continued. The operational<br>limit for zircaloy-2 in a reactor was found to be dependent on its absorption</p>
<p>-9-</p>
<p>of hydrogen during corrosion in high temperature water. Bettis eventually</p>
<p>found that by substituting iron for nickel, an alloy was produced which had<br>as good corrosion resistance as zircaloy-2, but cut hydrogen absorption in<br>half. This alloy, called zircaloy-4, has since been adopted as the structural<br>metal in most naval reactors produced after the mid-1960&#x27;s, as well as in</p>
<p>most civilian power generating station reactors.</p>
<p>Developing Production Sources</p>
<p>A basic reason for developing zirconium alloys was to lower the cost<br>of production. This was important, for by the mid-1950&#x27;s Congress had<br>authorized several nuclear submarines. My staff and I estimated that our<br>needs for zirconium would reach one million pounds a year within the next<br>five years. Our policy was to procure the zirconium we needed from<br>commercial sources. To do this we had to see to it that industry could<br>get the information it needed to learn the specifications and the production<br>process. We also had to convince industry that an attractive market existed,</p>
<p>In April 1956, the Wah Chang Corporation contracted to provide<br>600, 000 pounds of zirconium at a price just under $10 per pound. In a few<br>months, under the direction of Mr. Stephen Yih, they were in production.<br>Wah Chang has maintained its position of leadership. Over 70 percent of<br>the zirconium being made in the United States is produced at its facility. in<br>Albany.</p>
<p>-10-</p>
<p>I also sought and received proposals from other companies. That</p>
<p>same year, contracts were placed with three other private organizations.</p>
<p>These were fixed quantity, long-term arrangements, aimed at providing |<br>the basis for companies to invest capital for large-scale production<br>facilities. This action was the major step in achieving commercial production<br>sources for zirconium. Over ten million pounds of zirconium and about a<br>quarter of a million pounds of hafnium—which is also used in naval reactors—<br>were delivered under these contracts between 1957 and 1963, at an average</p>
<p>cost of about $6 per pound.</p>
<p>Use of Zirconium in Electrical Generating Station Reactors</p>
<p>The use of zirconium in reactors has not been limited to the Navy. It<br>is also the major reactor structural material in the nuclear central stations<br>now being operated and constructed throughout the United States. The first<br>such civilian power station was the Shippingport Atomic Power Station. In<br>July 1953, because of my experience with pressurized water reactors, the<br>Atomic Energy Commission assigned me the responsibility for this project.<br>Under my direction the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory designed, developed,<br>and built this reactor.</p>
<p>Official groundbreaking took place on September 6, 1954. President<br>Eisenhower, while visiting his wife&#x27;s family here in Denver, used a neutron<br>source to generate an electrical signal. This signal started an unmanned<br>bulldozer at Shippingport to move the first earth on this project. The</p>
<p>-ll-</p>
<p>Shippingport reactor began operation on December 2, 1957. This date</p>
<p>is significant. It was exactly fifteen years after Enrico Fermi achieved</p>
<p>the first nuclear chain reaction at Stagg Field in Chicago. Within three weeks,<br>the plant reached its full electrical power output, which was distributed on</p>
<p>the Duquesne Light Company transmission lines serving the Pittsburgh area,</p>
<p>Based on the operation of Shippingport and Subsequent nuclear power<br>plants, the commitment by electrical utility companies to nuclear power became<br>much greater during the late 1960&#x27;s and early 1970&#x27;s. As of March 1, 1975 » 09<br>nuclear powered electrical generating stations, witha capacity of over 39<br>million electrical kilowatts, were in operation in the United States. These 55<br>Plants, operating at a 70 percent capacity factor, produce ina year the energy<br>equivalent of 410 million barrels of oil, or 110 million tons of coal. All but<br>three of these plants use zircaloy cladding and structural material,</p>
<p>Based on the projected increased growth of electrical generating plants,<br>it is estimated that by the mid-1980&#x27;s the zirconium required for nuclear<br>reactors will be about 15 million pounds per year. The metal will be Supplied<br>by a zirconium industry less than twenty years old, and uSing a process</p>
<p>developed less than twenty-five years ago by Dr. Kroll.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I have emphasized that the decisions on zirconium were not gambles,<br>but risks, This does not mean that success was inevitable. It was not.<br>What I have tried to show is that risk can be narrowed, but it is not easy</p>
<p>to do so.<br>-]2-</p>
<p>To say that it is necessary to obtain facts, is little more useful than<br>offering a soothing platitude, In engineering development, as well as in<br>other fields, finding facts is arduous, exhausting, and time-consuming,<br>They do not exist in isolation, The Romans looked at a constellation in<br>the sky and called it Ursa Major. We call it the Big Dipper. The stars<br>are the same, but we are different from the Romans. So it is with data:<br>the use depends on your goal and your view.</p>
<p>The scientist can follow his quest in pursuit of knowledge. He can, to<br>use popular figures of speech, explore an endless frontier or a boundless<br>horizon, An engineer can&#x27;t. He has different responsibilities. He must<br>proceed from one point to another, But even this is drastic oversimplification,<br>The relations between means and the end are dynamic—a change at one point<br>affects others,</p>
<p>This fluidity places a particular responsibility upon the individual</p>
<p>in charge of a.development project. He cannot separate himself from<br>technical work. He must not allow himself to be isolated by layers of<br>administrators and managers. In Greek mythology, Antaeus was a giant who<br>was strong as long as he had contact with the earth. When he was lifted<br>from the earth he lost his strength. So it is with engineers, They must not<br>be isolated from the real world,</p>
<p>When Dr. Kroll and I met at Albany we dealt with details. We had to, .<br>We understood each other because we based our discussion on principles—</p>
<p>his were scientific, mine were engineering. Far too frequently people, —</p>
<p>-13-</p>
<p>particularly those who have just come from universities, are convinced</p>
<p>that if they learn the principles, that is all they need to know. The</p>
<p>decision on zirconium shows, this is not so, Of course you need principles,</p>
<p>but they are not enough,<br>The Devil is in the details, but so is salvation,<br>t</p>
