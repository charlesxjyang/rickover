      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In accepting the Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration on February 12, 1976, Admiral H. G. Rickover humbly dedicates the honor to the dedicated individuals across laboratories, factories, shipyards, and his nuclear Navy staff, acknowledging their collective effort as the foundation of all human achievement. He critiques contemporary ideas of guaranteed &quot;equality of results&quot; and the denigration of &quot;striving for accomplishment,&quot; advocating instead for ambition, excellence, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge as vital for progress and the survival of Western civilization. Rickover buttresses his arguments by quoting Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; speech, Alfred North Whitehead on the importance of trained intelligence, and Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;man&#x27;s reach should exceed his grasp.&quot; He credits the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and the Atomic Energy Commission, along with figures like Dr. Seamans and Admiral Holloway, for their crucial support, concluding with an anecdote about the Chinese prefect Lu Kung to underscore the unpredictable nature of recognition and the virtue of humility.</p>

        <p>Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, USN Upon Acceptance of the Distinguished Service Award Presented by the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration February 12, 1976</p>
<p>I am deeply honored to receive this award. I accept it in the name of all the dedicated people in the laboratories, the factories, the shipyards, my headquarters staff, and on board our nuclear powered ships, who have worked long and hard to give the United States an effective and ready nuclear Navy.</p>
<p>I have always felt that in honoring a person we must remember that all human achievement flows not only from individual effort but from associative effort as well. We, the living, are heirs to all the ideas and accomplishments of every human being who has ever lived. Nowhere is this more true than in the never-ending quest for new knowledge and for new ways to put this knowledge to practical use.</p>
<p>The developer of a new technology starts at the current technical level and seeks to raise it so as to profit from new scientific discoveries. By its very nature, this is a cooperative endeavor. Had our nuclear ship program not received the firm and constant support of the Congressional Joint Com- mittee on Atomic Energy and of the Atomic Energy Commission, it is</p>
<p>doubtful we would today have a fleet of nuclear submarines and surface ships.</p>
<p>But I would be remiss if I did not also give credit to the many who have</p>
<p>issisted in these endeavors; who have provided the backing and the money</p>
<p>/ to carry on the work, and without whom the nuclear propulsion program</p>
<p>would not be possible. In particular, Dr. Seamans, Secretary of the Navy Middendorf, Mr. Fri, Dr. Roberts, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Holloway. They and many others have given their guidance and</p>
<p>I believe it is appropriate on this occasion to make some comments:</p>
<p>In recent years there has been much written about equality; that not only are we born equal politically and mentally, but that we must all be guaranteed equality of results. To these beliefs is now being added the concept that it is even wrong to strive for accomplishment.</p>
<p>A recent newspaper article called such striving &quot;machismo, &quot; which in turn was characterized as &quot;intense striving for achievement, competitive- ness, aggressivity, impatience, and a constant awareness of the pressure of time and responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>The article quoted Theodore Roosevelt as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.&quot;</p>
<p>The author commented that Roosevelt's words were clearly foolish</p>
<p>F, : and dangerously romantic; that to believe as he did was to be &quot;trapped in eternal adolescence, &quot;'</p>
<p>The idea that the pursuit of excellence is foolish and romantic contradicts history. No discovery is brought forth, no innovation is carried through without great effort and single-minded obstinacy. Opposition arises because everything new endangers something old. A new machine replaces human hands; a new source of power threatens old businesses; a new trade route wipes out the supremacy of old ports and brings prosperity to new ones. This is the price which must be paid for progress, and it is worth it. Let us never stifle man's urge to push outward the boundaries of knowledge or Western civilization will stagnate and die.</p>
<p>We must realize, as Whitehead said so elegantly: ''The rule is absolute, the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed. Not all your victories on land or at sea can move back the finger of fate. Today we maintain ourselves. Tomorrow science will have moved forward yet one more step, and there will be no appeal from the judgment which will then be pronounced on the uneducated, &quot;</p>
<p>We believe in democratic government. In a democracy, one of government's most important duties is to promote the virtue and</p>
<p>intelligence of the people. Citizens in a democracy must be given equal</p>
<p>portunity to become educated. The way in which we discharge this</p>
<p>4 educational responsibility will largely determine our ability to survive.</p>
<p>But sometimes we forget that democracy is not a matter of rights alone; it depends for its very life on acceptance of corollary duties. If democracy meant no more than the right of each citizen to enjoy himself, provided in so doing he harmed no one else, it would be a shabby creed indeed for the people of a great country.</p>
<p>Democracy is not merely a political and social device to insure that under a properly elected government each citizen may enjoy complete personal freedom, bound only by the equal rights of other citizens. It is far more than that. Democracy guarantees everyone freedom and oppor - tunity to develop his mind and character without hindrance from external sources so that he may put them to use, not only for himself but for the community as well.</p>
<p>In striving for a free society of equal opportunity, we must not denigrate excellence, creativity, or achievement in the process. I have always subscribed to Robert Browning's thought: &quot;Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for ?''</p>
<p>And finally, the recipient of any award should give credit to another major element. When Lu Kung was prefect of Shang Ling in the first century, A.D., his city was devastated by fire, but he prostrated himself before it and it immediately went out. Later, when he became prefect of Hong Kong, the tigers which had previously infested the place swam across</p>
<p>‘the Yellow River with their cubs on their backs, and migrated elsewhere. The Emperor heard about these things and wondered at them, and promoted Lu Kung to be chief of the personnel department. The Emperor said to him: &quot;By what virtue did you thus manage affairs ?&quot;&quot; Lu Kung replied: &quot;It was all the purest chance. '' One might have thought that such a reply would have lost him a fine opportunity of getting ahead. But the Emperor said:</p>
<p>&quot;This is a worthy reply. Let the annalists record it.&quot;</p>
