      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1978 speech, Admiral H.G. Rickover expresses profound concern over the deteriorating state of education in the United States, drawing on his three decades of interviewing over 12,000 top graduates from 150 colleges for the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear Propulsion Program. He observes a significant decline in basic knowledge among recent graduates, despite inflated grades, and notes that Navy recruits often require remedial courses to reach a sixth-grade reading level, with a dramatic 90% of University of the District of Columbia freshmen needing remedial English and math. Rickover attributes this decline to schools prioritizing &quot;innovation&quot; and extracurricular activities over core academic subjects like reading, writing, and mathematics, and to the absence of clear competency standards and adequate teacher supervision. He also places significant responsibility on parents, urging them to prioritize intellectual growth over sports or entertainment, limit television viewing (noting the average child watches over 4,000 hours by first grade), and actively foster a love of reading, asserting that a quality education is crucial for individual freedom and the nation&#x27;s future.</p>

        <p>Remarks of Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy before the Charleston Council of the Navy League of the United States Charleston, South Carolina 13 October 1978</p>
<p>I know that you, as members and friends of the Navy League, are concerned not just with matters affecting the Navy but also with those affecting our nation as a whole. Therefore, this evening I would like to address an issue of vital importance within the Navy 4nd throughout the country—the education of our children.</p>
<p>During the past quarter century, as head of the Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program, I have had a unique opportunity to judge the products of our schools. In searching for young officers to meet the demands of this program, I have interviewed, over the last three decades, more than 12, 000 top graduates from 150 colleges and universities. I look for people with ability to think for themselves; who understand the basic principles of the courses they have taken; and who speak clearly. I find some who are well-qualified, But a growing number do not measure up to their diploma.</p>
<p>In case after case, not only in engineering, mathemutics, and science,</p>
<p>but in history, foreign language, economics, and other fields, I find students</p>
<p>who have excellent academic records, but are unable to discuss even the</p>
<p>fundamentals of their disciplines. From what I see, the basic knowledge shown by recent graduates is much less than that shown by those I inter- viewed 15 years ago. Yet each had received good grades, and therefore each believed he had learned what was expected of him.</p>
<p>I also see the products of our secondary schools—the enlisted men in the naval nuclear program. These are selected from the top high school graduates entering the Navy. Yet, in recent years, I have had to teach remedial courses in the basics of mathematics and physics to prepare them for nuclear power school. ‘</p>
<p>Similar problems obtain elsewhere in the Navy, where there is difficulty finding young men who read well enough to perform their jobs. Because many recruits cannot read adequately, the Navy now must conduct special remedial courses to raise the reading skill of high school graduates to the sixth grade level.</p>
<p>This problem is not unique to the Navy. A parallel exists in nearly every aspect of civilian life. Employers must now teach basic skills that should have been learned in elementary school. More and more colleges are compelled to conduct remedial courses for high school graduates who are inadequately prepared in reading, writing, and mathematics. A dramatic example is the so-called University of the District of Columbia, where about 90 percent of incoming freshmen this fall must take remedial</p>
<p>courses in English and mathematics in order to prepare themselves for college-level work,</p>
<p>Despite rising grades, test Scores on college entrance examinations and various achievem ent tests have been dropping steadily for over a decade, The National Assessment of Educational Progress reports that the writing ability of teenagers has declined, Diplomas, and the inflated grades given, no longer accurately represent true academic accomplishment,</p>
<p>The schools themselves must bear substantial responsibility for this decline in student achievement, Many schools, spurred by demands for &quot;innovation, &quot; have made it possible for students to avoid courses that - provide a solid grounding in reading, writing, and mathematics, There have been declining enrollments in basic academic courses, These have been supplanted by less demanding electives and entertaining extracurri- cular activities, In many schools, the amount of time actually spent by teachers on instruction has dropped Significantly,</p>
<p>AS a result of efforts to instill &quot;relevance&quot; in education, substantial Sums have been wasted in programs directed more toward providing amusement than developing the ability to sort facts and make intelligent decisions, These programs place a high priority on freedom of choice | in selecting courses, without ensuring that the choices are structured to meet academic needs, At this stage in their development, most children are not competent to decide what is in their own best interest, or how much &quot;creative freedom&quot; they should be permitted,</p>
<p>Many schools foster attitudes that do not prepare students for the world's harsh realities. They promote the notion that learning must be easy and entertaining. This idea is cruel to the child and dangerous to society; children then grow up believing they need not struggle to excel. There is simply no way to combine the provision of instant happiness with the business of learning to read, write, and calculate. Learning can be interesting, rewarding, and exciting, but it requires effort. It is work. No learning takes place, just as no ditch gets dug, without work,</p>
<p>Most developed countries have definitive and known standards of intellectual accomplishment. But in our country, what a child should © know at a given stage of his academic career has remained undefined, Without objective measures of how well schools are preparing students for the demands of our society, our educational system has fallen prey to the exaggerated claims of designers of new curricula and teaching methods. Too late we have learned how ineffective or even harmful some of these changes in subject matter and instruction have been.</p>
<p>Schools must have objective measures of student performance in relation to clearly defined standards of educational proficiency, especially in the basic subjects of reading, writing, and mathematics. To opavate our schools without appropriate standards and tests is tantamount to getting vaccinated and not caring to find out if the vaccination &quot;took. &quot; Yet, recent attempts to establish such competency standards and tests</p>
<p>have been vehemently opposed by many in the education community, particularly the National Education Association—the ''teachers' union, &quot; They argue that there is already too much emphasis on test scores as a measure of student performance; or that competency standards and tests are unfair to minorities and the disadvantaged; or that teachers will set their sights on minimum standards and not try to progress beyond them.</p>
<p>These arguments make no sense, Obviously, no test is perfect, and a single test score does not tell us everything about a child's intellectual development. But testing—particularly testing against objective standards—is an essential step in gauging Student progress and achievement, |</p>
<p>Further, minorities and the disadvantaged are the very ones who have most to gain from competency standards and tests. Many minority group leaders recognize that to expect less from minority children is the cruelest form of discrimination, They now endorse competency standards and tests as a means to help their children get a fair education.</p>
<p>As to the contention that &quot;the minimum will become the maximum, &quot;' I do not believe good teachers would reorient their courses and reduce content in order to prepare all students to meet merely the minimum competency standards. Instead, schools whose students are not meeting standards for reading, writing, and mathematics would be required to focus the necessary attention on developing these skills.</p>
<p>To improve our schools we Should do the following:</p>
<p>e First we should ensure that the primar al of schonls is the intellectual development of the children, ———— ment of the children</p>
<p>Schools must develop in each child the ability to read, to write clearly, to calculate, to think critically and logically, and to acquire knowledge of the world through history, literature, Science, and art, Unfortunately, basic education in our schools today is competing with and being overwhelmed by career educa- tion, consumer education, energy education, Arug education, Sex education, and many others, Our educational system igs being asked to do too many things; as a result, it is doing few of them well, Every school System should conduct a thorough and critical review of its curriculum to ensure that it provides</p>
<p>for a strong academic Program of basic education,</p>
<p>Second, we should establish carefully-pre ared standards of competency in reading writing, and mathematics,</p>
<p>I believe the absence of Competency standards is fundamental to many of the problems facing American education today. Testing against competency standards should begin in the early grades in order to diagnose and correct deficiencies when they first appear, With competency Standards, parents will] be able to find out how</p>
<p>well their children are actually doing without having to rely</p>
<p>solely on the judgment of teachers or school Officials, -</p>
<p>e@ Third, we should re uire teachers to be knowledgeable in the</p>
<p>subject matter they teach, and to demonstrate the reading,</p>
<p>writing, and mathematical skills necessary to evaluate student performance and serve as appropriate models for them,</p>
<p>Sadly, many teachers today do not have the basic skills the students themselves lack, Too often, teachers are the products of teachers' colleges which emphasize the theory of education. They are then Supposed to be capable of teaching any subject, regardless of their knowledge of that subject, Some states foster this Concept by qualifying teachers based on the number of education courses in teaching techniques rather than on competence and skill in subject matter,</p>
<p>While classroom management, discipline, and method of presentation are necessary, they are not a substitute for mastery of the subjects being taught, It is essential that teachers themselves be proficient in the reading, writing, and mathematics they are trying to teach our children,</p>
<p>Teachers should be required to demonstrate routinely,</p>
<p>through written examinations, their own expertise in these basic skills before being allowed to teach, 7</p>
<p>Fourth, we should demand close supervision of teachers by</p>
<p>administrators and principals who are competent and experienced teachers themselves,</p>
<p>For any endeavor to be successful, those responsible must involve themselves in the details of day-to-day operations, The supervision and training of subordinates is the single most important duty of the one in charge. Yet achool teachers are among the most unsupervised workers in our society. The notion of academic freedom, combined with tenure protection, often results in each teacher determining on his own what subject matter is taught and how it is presented, And some school administrators are not themselves experienced or competent teachers and are not capable of evaluating teacher _</p>
<p>performance,</p>
<p>Fifth, we should improve in-service training of teachers,</p>
<p>In too many schools, training of teachers consists merely of granting them time off to attend conventions and symposia or requiring that they periodically take additional courses in subjects of interest to them, but often of no value to their</p>
<p>teaching function.</p>
<p>e Sixth, we should free teachers insofar as ssible from</p>
<p>responsibilities extraneous to their teaching,</p>
<p>The effectiveness of good teachers can be enhanced by freeing them from burdensome administrative and extra- curricular duties, Far too much of this is of little use and is merely a job-making device. Teachers burdened with large amounts of clerical and administrative work have a strong incentive to structure their courses so as to minimize such work, This results in simplified tests and little demand for written work, It is not surprising that true-false examina- . tions or multiple choice tests have largely replaced written assignments so essential to the development of writing and</p>
<p>reasoning,</p>
<p>Over the last generation, our schools have made many concessions</p>
<p>serving to lower academic standards and robbing students of a better</p>
<p>education. Unless improvements in the training and supervision of</p>
<p>teachers are coupled with renewed emphasis on more rigorous academic ,</p>
<p>programs, student achievement will continue to decline,</p>
<p>At the same time, parents must recognize that they, too, have</p>
<p>contributed to the poor academic performance of their children, Parents</p>
<p>share with the school the responsibility for correcting this problem, for</p>
<p>only the parents can control those factors outside of the classroom which</p>
<p>affect student performance in school.</p>
<p>Specifically, parents should take the following steps to help assure</p>
<p>that their children are afforded the best possible opportunity to learn:</p>
<p>e First, parents must eschew the notion that any problem can be solved by spending more money,</p>
<p>The education of children requires much more than money, It requires of parents their personal dedication and investment</p>
<p>Second, parents must come to trust their own ability to judge whether their children are receiving a proper ‘education,</p>
<p>Parents cannot afford to be intimidated by vociferous educators and defer to them as experts. What goes on in our schools is not the private domain of educators; it is the people's public business. Parents have a right and a duty to learn as much as possible about their children's schooling.</p>
<p>Third, parents must impress upon their children the importance ofa good education.</p>
<p>Respect for academic excellence is what makes teaching possible. Unless children feel that what the teachers are trying</p>
<p>to do is valuable, the teachers have little chance of succeeding,</p>
<p>? J : \</p>
<p>@ Fourt arents must conve the idea that the</p>
<p>of school is intellectual growth, not Sports competition or social events,</p>
<p>Too often, children find their Parents more Supportive of athletic prowess or popularity than academic accomplishment, This distortion of priorities extends beyond the School and ig evident in the lifestyles of many American adults. Whena Washington area telecast of a professional football game was preempted by the late Pope John Paul's coronation. last month, ~~ thousands of angry viewers called the TV station to protest this delay of their Sunday afternoon entertainment, Can we expert our schools to turn out graduates who value intellectua] pursuits</p>
<p>' when the parents themselves are obsessed with being entertained</p>
<p>at the expense of being informed ?</p>
<p>Fifth, parents must strictly limit the amount of time children are permitted to watch television, |</p>
<p>By first grade, the average child has watched over 4, 000 hours of television. The typical high schoo] graduate has spent more time looking at television than in the classroom, It is little wonder that homework assignments and leisure reading have all but vanished. Only the parents can reverse this</p>
<p>alarming trend, Television networks, which are in reality ~~’ advertising agencies, are run for profit. They are not going to restrict their programming so that children watch less TY, And certainly the children cannot be expected to voluntarily choose homework or reading over the alluring entertainment</p>
<p>of TV.</p>
<p>Sixth, parents must help their children discover the world of .</p>
<p>books as an alternative to television,</p>
<p>The book is definitely superior to television as a means of education, Reading is active, whereas television watching is : passive. A book allows the reader to stop, reflect, to return to an important passage—months or even years after the first reading. Television is non-stop, giving the viewer no time to think; he is rushed from one scene to the next. If parents set an example and show a preference for reading over television,</p>
<p>their children are likely to follow this pattern.</p>
<p>Nothing we bestow upon our children in the way of material advantages</p>
<p>can compare with the gift of a good education. For only an educated person</p>
<p>can achieve personal independence, which is so essential to political free-</p>
<p>dom. The person who has learned to trust only proven facts, who knows</p>
<p>how to find and recognize truth, who has been trained to decide all issues</p>
<p>on the basis of truth and reason—only this person is truly free, If we allow increasing numbers of our citizens to remain shackled by ignorance and superstition, dependent upon the opinions of others, and fearful of disagreeable facts, then the democratic freedom of our nation will be : jeopardized. The quality of the education we give to our children has an essential bearing, not only on their individual futures, but on the destiny</p>
<p>of our country as well.</p>
