      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s 1982 memo, &quot;The Will and The Way,&quot; delivers a scathing critique of American education, positing that a lack of professional standards for teachers and a misguided shift from academic excellence to &quot;egalitarian socialization&quot; have led to a national decline. He substantiates this argument with striking figures, including the military&#x27;s $60 million annual expenditure on remedial reading, the fact that 25-40% of college freshmen require remedial work, stagnant SAT scores, and significantly lower GRE aptitude scores for education majors. Rickover champions comprehensive reforms, advocating for a return to rigorous liberal education centered on the &quot;three R&#x27;s,&quot; mandatory academic courses prioritized over electives, nationwide standardized performance examinations, and performance-based teacher compensation. He emphasizes the crucial responsibility of parents and students in demanding and pursuing educational excellence, citing successful reforms like the Modesto, California plan, which saw 20-30 point SAT score increases. The memo also references articles such as a Wall Street Journal report on school violence to underscore the challenges, ultimately urging an unwavering commitment to intellectual achievement to safeguard the nation&#x27;s future.</p>

<p>_ THE WILL AND THE WAY<br>(Some Thoughts on Im mproving American Education)</p>
<p>By ADMIRAL H.&#x27;G. RICKOVER, U.S. Navy</p>
<p>No occupation can be conducted properly unless it has</p>
<p>Standards. This is true of the Presidency, the Congress, the</p>
<p>to measure performance, ‘through the ballot box, : of promotions,. or profits /</p>
<p>military and of industry. In most of life, criteria are established</p>
<p>Teaching, on the other hand, as important a profession as any-- r<br>and in my estimation more important--has few if any standards. :<br>This operates to the great advantage of teachers who, as a result,</p>
<p>do not generally have to qualify for their positions. Yet their<br>vocation is most important because it is through schools that &quot;<br>society transmits our knowledge, history, responsibilities and</p>
<p>aspirations.</p>
<p>* Weegee</p>
<p>No knowledgeable observer of the American scene would<br>agree that our teachers, especially in secondary schools, are</p>
<p>acequate for providing the high degree of excellence essential</p>
<p>to the national welfare.</p>
<p>The reason I write feelingly on this subject is because I</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>came to this country as an immigrant at the age of six--without<br>knowing a word of English. Yet because of our educational system</p>
<p>I was able to learn English quickly, able to develop other</p>
<p>SAD amines &amp;</p>
<p>interests, able to go to the Naval Academy, and subsequently to<br>carry out important assignments. What I was able to accomplish</p>
<p>“was due to two things: First, my desire to learn; second, a litle</p>
<p>good free educational system.</p>
<p>Without such a system and its dedicated teachers, I could<br>not have accomplished this. It is for this reason I am writing<br>about the need to have the best education for our children.</p>
<p>We can give them a pleasant life, clothe them well, amuse then.<br>But nothing we can do for them is as valuable as a good education.<br>Further, education has lasting value. Not only does it influence<br>the individual, but it can be passed on to our descendants. In<br>this way we are doubly served by a good educational system.</p>
<p>In line with these thoughts I will describe some things I</p>
<p>consider we must do to insure the best education for our children.</p>
<p>Just how bad things remain!</p>
<p>is well illustrated by the fact<br>that the largest users of our high school graduates--business,<br>industry, colleges and the military--are often forced to build</p>
<p>and operate their own remedial programs, especially in<br>mathematics and English. The military, for example, spends some<br>$60 million per year in developing basic reading skills; between<br>25-40% of enrolled college freshmen require remedial work.”</p>
<p>This represents the expenditure of large amounts of time and money<br>for basic education which properly should have been completed at<br>the high school level.</p>
<p>There have been some salutory changes in our education system</p>
<p>since Sputnik. These include greater percentages of minority</p>
<p>and under-privileged children in school and increasing rates of<br>high school completion®. “But these changes have been bought</p>
<p>at a cost--an average decline in overall intellectual competence of<br>college bound high school graduates, and a failure to develop</p>
<p>specific skills among those who leave high schools to enter the</p>
<p>work force.“</p>
<p>The poorly educated adult becomes one more member of an<br>increasingly large &quot;underclass,&quot; and further may become a burden<br>on our society. In the national sense, poor education spells<br>decline. The result is an inadequate pool of competent citizens,<br>not only in technology and science, but in other areas where<br>high achievement is necessary to maintain our position inter-<br>nationally--military and economic. Moreover, we can not remain<br>confident of relying on importing brains and skills from other<br>countries when we fail to produce our own.</p>
<p>The long-term decline in academic performance is most<br>evidenced by declining Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores.<br>The recent heralded reversal in this trend is minor and Statistically<br>insignificant. A mere 3 points rise in average SATs offers no<br>basis for optimism; rather it represents a bottoming out at an<br>abysmal level. With 800 being a perfect score in each of the two<br>parts of the test, the average verbal score in 1982 rose only 2 points<br>from 424 to 426 while the math score rose from 466 to 467.</p>
<p>It is possible that this recent rise reflects proportionately<br>fewer--but better qualified--students entering college and<br>taking the SATs. In any event, &quot;one swallow does not make a<br>summer.&quot; It is just too early to be sure of any long-term<br>upward movement.<br>The American public school system--not only in terms of its</p>
<p>specific curricular and teaching deficiencies--has changed over the</p>
<p>last decade in an unfortunate direction. This is because of the novel<br>idea that our schools should be egalitarian socializers, instead of, as<br>should be the case, excellent educators. This emphasis on</p>
<p>“fitting in&quot;, &quot;compensating&quot;, &quot;affirming&quot; and &quot;democratizing&quot; is</p>
<p>deleterious to academic excellence. It deprives students and</p>
<p>educators of precious time more appropriately required to achieve<br>intellectually broad and employable competencies in the process<br>of learning, thinking and analysis. These can be achieved only<br>through the intensive development of speaking and writing skills.</p>
<p>Our secondary schools have tried to do too many things for<br>too many constituencies. The result of irrelevant activities<br>can be measured by the decline in time and resources devoted to<br>basic teaching and learning--in the shift in educational priorities<br>to non-academic pursuits such as training of athletes, building<br>of administrative staffs and the use of teachers as day-care<br>custodians for unmotivated adolescents.</p>
<p>We have seen a decline in required courses, especially of<br>the so-called &quot;academic solids&quot; and those having to do with<br>achieving competence in fields as foreign languages, math and<br>science. Instead, the curricula have an increased number of<br>&quot;relevant&quot; courses, especially those for &quot;alternative learning&quot;<br>and general entertainment. Tests of competence in subject matter<br>have been replaced by subjective tests and grading on the curve;<br>by de-emphasis on written expository skills and substitution of<br>&quot;objective&quot; exams. These may facilitate quick grading and easy<br>quantitative scoring, but they are inappropriate for testing<br>intellectual acuity, verbal fluency, and the theoretical proficiency<br>required in today&#x27;s world.</p>
<p>Some of the blame rests on teachers; their low ‘<br>abilities. At the colleges where they are trained, they are among</p>
<p>the lowest as measured by Graduate Record Examination<br>Aptitude Test Scores. Students whose intended field of study was</p>
<p>in the education area (four categories--education including M.A.</p>
<p>in teaching, educational administration, guidance/counseling,</p>
<p>and physical education) averaged 440 Verbal and 467 in the<br>Quantitative scoring in the GRE-Aptitude Test Scores administered<br>from 1977 through 1980. In comparison, all seniors and non-<br>enrolled college graduates for the same period, whose fields of<br>endeavor were other than education, averaged 497 Verbal and<br>531 in the Quantitative scoring. Further, many major in methods<br>of education instead of substantial academic disciplines.<br>Further, good teachers must spend considerable time on<br>non-teaching tasks and on discipline. For example, the following<br>Wall Street Journal article of November 17, 1982, entitled<br>&quot;Righteous Indignation&quot; states: &quot;A Brooklyn, N.Y. high school<br>principal last week asked police to search Students entering<br>the building for weapons. The search uncovered knives, razor<br>blades, iron pipes and karate Sticks. Hundreds of Students then<br>rioted, wrecking the school and beating up a teacher. A<br>community group has now charged the Board of Education with</p>
<p>&quot;provoking a riot.</p>
<p>Some of the blame for this deplorable state must be placed on<br>principals and administrators. It has been remarked that while &quot;The<br>principal is the chief protector of educational internalities...<br>too many principals are people whose foremost value is not rocking<br>the boat.” This, together with the fact that principals and<br>school boards often reinforce each other&#x27;s administrative<br>deficiencies and political timidity, guarantees a teaching</p>
<p>environment not Supportive of true pedagogical excellence and</p>
<p>high Student achievement.</p>
<p>nm</p>
<p>i -</p>
<p>What are we to do? Among the changes I advocate are</p>
<p>these:</p>
<p>e A return to a truly liberal education--one based on<br>early achievement and constant practice of the three R&#x27;s. This<br>will result in the ability to read intelligently, think precisely,<br>speak fluently, and write clearly. To this end, ‘mandatory<br>academic courses must be given priority over electives. Intellectual<br>discipline and hard work must be cultivated as indispensible to<br>the achievement of true intellectual competence. Finally, academic<br>excellence should be rewarded and celebrated at the expense of</p>
<p>sports programs and other non-academic pursuits,</p>
<p>e The establishment of a nationwide system of standardized<br>performance examinations throughout the student&#x27;s school years.<br>Schools should promote and reward students on the basis of<br>demonstrated achievement alone. Rigorous performance testing must<br>be frequent. This would ensure that parents, teachers, and<br>students have constant, accurate knowledge of childrens&#x27; absolute<br>and relative academic standing. SAT exams toward the end of<br>high school are too late to do much good.</p>
<p>@ Pay teachers more, but only in return for higher<br>standards in teacher training, recruitment, and measured on-the-job<br>performance.</p>
<p>e Aside from the critical importance of parental interest<br>in education, the most important step is to ensure that children<br>are taught by competent teachers to assure that they are well<br>ecucated. Drastic improvements are needed. We must start by<br>attracting the best teachers and thereafter rewarding them<br>differentially on the basis of achieving excellence in ecademic</p>
<p>performance. ‘</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>a 2s Oo</p>
<p>The Modesto, California school system provides an example<br>of what can be done to improve educational accomplishment<br>dramtically. In that system, the average rise in verbal and<br>math SAT scores was on the order of 20-30 points in but two years.<br>So too, state-mandated competence levels were achieved by<br>virtually all seniors (97%). All that was necessary was for<br>them to &#x27;&quot;&#x27;...work hard for something they believe in than (to)<br>enjoy a pampered idleness.&quot; Of course, Modesto&#x27;s is but one<br>example of successful reform; there are others also. The point<br>to be made here is that we must examine successful reforms and<br>follow their lead rather than simply inventing and implementing<br>new theories.<br>If we are to be realistically optimistic in effecting reforms,<br>the interested parties must first reform themselves. Specifically:<br>e Parents must assume personal responsibility for the<br>education of their children. Turning this over to &quot;educational<br>experts&quot; and other custodians will not suffice.<br>@ The public must demand excellence in education and<br>be willing to pay for it even if this requires eliminating sports<br>and other non-academic programs.<br>e Students must be convinced that it is they who<br>are ultimately responsible for their education; that there —<br>is no easy way, no short-cut to excellence; no magic wand that<br>can produce the trained and disciplined minds they will need<br>as adults.<br>Many obstacles must be overcome to redress the errors of our<br>educational system. From past experience, I am not optimistic.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we must keep trying. To do otherwise would be a</p>
<p>dereliction of duty by parents and by all of us, and will<br>result in a degraded future for our children.</p>
<p>What might initially be obstacles to constructive change may,<br>in fact, be an important source of the required solutions. I<br>refer to the various segments that should be interested in education--<br>teachers, principals, school boards, students and--most importantly--<br>parents. They are the most important force in recognizing and<br>redressing our educational decline. Without parental support and<br>their informed and active participation demanding reform, little<br>can be done. For, when the &quot;push comes to shove,&quot; it is primarily,<br>and only parents who will possess the &quot;long-range&quot; view in accomplishing<br>something enduring. The important potential and power of parents--their<br>sacred duty--is to ensure the well-being of their children and<br>their progeny. If they do not carry out this duty, no one<br>else can be expected, as surrogate, to achieve the excellence<br>which can be accomplished only by the well-educated.</p>
<p>I repeat: teachers must be properly rewarded. This will lead<br>to high quality, constant improvement and true commitment.<br>The low quality and morale of many teachers is due to poor<br>training and a system of reward that runs counter to the ideals<br>which would result in the intellectual excellence in their students.<br>Teachers&#x27; unions, often motivated by selfish concerns, should make<br>the good of their &quot;customers&quot;--our children--their principal<br>objective. If they do so, they will have little difficulty<br>reaching their monetary aims.</p>
<p>For their part, school boards, administrators, and principals</p>
<p>must become less independent politically and less timid of</p>
<p>charges of elitism, racism, and ethnocentrism. There is nothing<br>undemocratic in excellence. Poor education, itself, is the<br>insidious cause of an underclass of untaught, unemployable<br>proletarians. Indeed, what we now have is an anti-elitist<br>System which has the anti-democratic consequences of permanent<br>incompetence and poverty.</p>
<p>School systems must be encouraged to develop excellent students<br>to their full potential. In this way they serve themselves and<br>act as examples of excellence for under-motivated, under-achieving<br>and bored class-mates. Such comparison is not elitist or<br>undemocratic. To the contrary, it results in great advantage for<br>many who otherwise would not have known academic excellence or<br>seen it achieved and rewarded.</p>
<p>Some cautions are in order:</p>
<p>e First, we must recognize that not every school can be<br>excellent. Our goals will not be achieved by directing our<br>attention to all students, regardless of motivation. Rather, I<br>Suggest we concentrate on those schools and those teachers who<br>already have the will to achieve excellence. ‘We must Support their<br>efforts to the degree consistent with equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>The results will be there for all to see--and will act as a<br>comparison and stimulation for the under-achievers. Guarantee<br>equality of opportunity, but support those who work to excel;</p>
<p>this will inspire others.</p>
<p>.@ Second, we must learn from the better educational performance</p>
<p>of other countries. But here our heterogeneity is in contrast with<br>the cultural homogeneity of European countries and Japan. We</p>
<p>must maintain and extend our classless society and its promise of</p>
<p>upward mobility through achievement stemming from opportunity.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>re</p>
<p>e Finally, we must not allow reforms, local or</p>
<p>national, to be co-opted by doctrinaire ideologists--conservative,<br>liberal, or populist--who would politicize curricular and other<br>reforms and subordinate them to the inculcation of partisan<br>doctrine or privilege.</p>
<p>We know what needs to be done; we know the national<br>importance of achieving this. But institutions and experts<br>alone can not make these things happen.</p>
<p>It is parents who must decide the kind and level of excellence<br>to demand in education. And for parents to settle for anything short of<br>realizing the highest degree of our children&#x27;s potential is to<br>sell their birthright for a mess of parental self-indulgent potage.</p>
<p>Nations can prevail or decline; only individuals can<br>experience the achievement of excellence. And only as individuals<br>will we suffer the consequences of failing to establish the basis</p>
<p>for that excellence which comes from educational achievement.</p>
