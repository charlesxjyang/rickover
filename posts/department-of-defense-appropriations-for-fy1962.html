      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his May 1961 testimony to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, Admiral Hyman Rickover provided an update on the nuclear Navy, highlighting the successful operation and increasing reliability of nuclear submarines, with 20 already operational and 33 projected by the end of 1962. He emphasized that nuclear plant costs were decreasing (e.g., Skipjack-type plant costs dropped from $18 million to $9 million, and Nautilus core life increased by 100% while costs decreased by 20%), asserting that nuclear power was unfairly scapegoated for overall rising ship construction costs. Rickover passionately advocated for nuclear surface ships, citing their &quot;virtually unlimited high-powered endurance&quot; (a nuclear frigate could travel 150,000-180,000 miles compared to a conventional&#x27;s &lt;3,000 miles), which offers significant military advantages, despite a higher initial cost (about 1.5 times conventional). He also critiqued Navy management, particularly personnel selection and training for nuclear ships, the inefficiencies in R&amp;D due to lack of continuity and technical expertise, and the Naval Academy&#x27;s educational approach, which he felt fostered immaturity and failed to adequately train officers. Finally, Rickover condemned the practice of allowing defense contractors to charge advertising costs to the government, arguing it&#x27;s a waste of money, a source of classified information leaks, and merely glorifies the companies.</p>
