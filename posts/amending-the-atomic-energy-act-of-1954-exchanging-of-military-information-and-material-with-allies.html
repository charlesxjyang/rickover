      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s testimony before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on February 27, 1958, provided a nuanced perspective on amending the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to facilitate military information exchange with allies. While generally supportive of cooperation with Great Britain to &quot;conserve the scientific and engineering talents of the two countries,&quot; Rickover expressed significant frustration with detailed British technical inquiries, arguing they excessively burdened U.S. personnel and diverted focus from their own critical programs. He highlighted the U.S.&#x27;s advanced position in nuclear submarine technology compared to the Soviets, assessing a reported 5,000 kilowatt Russian reactor as a &quot;propaganda stunt.&quot; Rickover strongly advocated for centralizing all atomic energy information exchange under the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) due to its stable personnel, contrasting it with the Department of Defense&#x27;s shifting staff. He also urged extreme caution regarding information transfer to other allies, citing potential security risks and the ease with which such information could be compromised, stressing the need to protect vital military secrets and the U.S.&#x27;s &quot;lead unnecessarily.&quot; Finally, he called for a principle of &quot;holistic reciprocity,&quot; asserting that if the U.S. provides information, it should receive a valuable return, irrespective of an ally&#x27;s internal or constitutional limitations.</p>

<p>Before we resume receiving testimony from the Atomic Energy<br>Commission and the Department of Defense, I would like at this<br>point to place in the record copies of three letters, dated February 13,<br>1958, which I sent to Mr. Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the Atomic<br>Energy Commission, Gen. Herbert B. Loper, Assistant to the Secre-<br>tary of Defense, and Gen. K. E. Fields, General Manager, AEC. - In<br>the letters to Chairman Strauss and General Loper, I requested that<br>they be prepared to answer certain additional questions. In the letter<br>to the General Manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, I re-</p>
<p>. quested that Admiral Rickover be available to testify with respect</p>
<p>to the opportunities and problems presented by the current exchange<br>of nuclear submariné ‘information with Great Britain.<br>(The letters referred to follow :)</p>

<p>Dear Mx. Frecps: You will recall that in the hearing held by the Research and<br>Development and Military Application Subcommittees last month on the activi-<br>ties of the Naval Reactors Branch, Admiral Rickover in his testimony touched<br>upon the cooperation between the AEC and the British in making restricted data<br>available to the British in connection with their nuclear submarine program.</p>
<p>I believe it would be desirable as a means of obtaining a picture of concrete<br>opportunities and problems presented by the proposed amendments to the Atomic<br>Energy Act on the exchange of information, to have Admiral Rickover testify at<br>greater length as to the opportunities and problems presented by the exchange<br>of submarine and other restricted data under the current agreement for coopera-<br>tion, Aceordingly, it is requested that ‘Admiral Rickover be present and availa-<br>dle to testify on ‘Tuesday, February 19, at 10 a. m., when we resume considera-<br>tion of the proposed amendments to the Atomic Energy Act on the Exchange of<br>information.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>. ‘ Joun O. PASTORE,<br>Chairman, Agreements for Cooperation.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. It was our intention to begin this morning’s hear-<br>‘ing with the Atomic Energy Commission prepared to continue its<br>‘testimony, but for the purposes of this meeting I am going to interrupt<br>this phase of it at this time and will permit Admiral Rickover to be<br>the first witness. I understand Admiral Strauss is here now and he<br>and others will follow. Before you and the other Commissioners<br>begin your statement, copies of which were delivered to the committee<br>late yesterday and which we have not had an opportunity to review,<br>in view of its length, I would like your permission first to put some<br>questions to Admiral: Rickover and then if he desires we can excuse<br>him and go into the Commission’s statement.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rickover, do you desire to make a preliminary statement</p>
<p>‘on your own with reference to this or subject yourself to questioning ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I would prefer to subject myself to questioning.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Well, we would prefer to have .you make an<br>opening statement. {Laughter.]-__- ; :<br>&quot;Let me put it this way, Admiral Rickover:. You are quite familiar<br>‘with the recommendations that have been made on the part of the<br>administration—and that includes ‘the ‘Department of Defense, the<br>‘Atomic Energy Commission, and the executive ‘department as 2<br>whole—with relation to changing the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to<br>Perinit 2 gréater exchange of inforiation with ‘some of our allies?<br>“st Admiral RrcKover. Yes, sir; 1 am fainiliar with that. ,</p>
<p>162 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>Senator Pasrors. And you are familiar with the fact that part of<br>this exchange will involve that phase of our activities which have to<br>do with submarines and atomically propelled-submarines, with which<br>you are quite familiar ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricrovrr. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. With regard to that, do you feel you would like<br>to give us some general observations and then we can ask you<br>questions ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I can do that, sir. .</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorn. Yes. ‘</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcoxover. I have had experience over a period of about 3<br>years in the considerations leading to the exchange of information<br>with the British for submarines, and in the actual exchange. The basic<br>objective of exchange, not only of submarine information but of all<br>information, is to conserve the scientific and engineering talents of the<br>two countries. But in some of the workings out of the agreement, not</p>
<p>-only for submarines but in other aspects, this may have been lost sight</p>
<p>of; and J think there are some reasons for this, and this is what I<br>would like to talk about.<br>When the agreement for the exchange of submarine information was<br>consummated we arranged for a group of about 25 leading engineers<br>and scientists from British industry and from their Admiralty to<br>come to this country. We opened up to them more of our information</p>
<p>and facilities than we had ever opened up to any other group. They<br>‘spent 2 weeks in this country. We conducted them through our</p>
<p>laboratories and some of the private industrial organizations, ‘They<br>stated at the conclusion of this trip that never before within the<br>knowledge of any group that had come over here had they been<br>treated as well and given as much information.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of their visit I made it clear to them that we could<br>not be placed in a position of criticizing their designs, that we had a<br>great deal of work to do; we had given them information in accordance<br>with the agreement, and they would have to go back and digest this<br>information and go ahead with their own design; we would help them<br>as much as we possibly could.</p>
<p>But it did not actually turn out this way even though the leading<br>people in Britain, that is, in their Atomic Energy Commission and<br>in the Admiralty, were for getting broad information and building a<br>submarine quickly. This idea was not fully realized by the various<br>industrial organizations that were involved, and some of them looked<br>on this as a means for getting detailed technical know-how to use in<br>their own industry. So as a result of that they started asking for<br>detailed information.</p>
<p>For example, we would give them blueprints, complete design infor-<br>mation for something, where they could have gone and manufactured<br>the item, if they wished to, or buy it from the United States, but that<br>is not what they wanted. They wanted to come over here and have us<br>come over there, and they would say, “Why did you make the gasket<br>this dimension?” or “Why did you make this bolt of such and such a<br>dimension ?”</p>
<p>So the net results would be, if we acceded to any extent to requests<br>of that kind, we would be tying up our people and we would not be<br>able to do our own work.</p>
<p>(</p>
<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1904 1638</p>
<p>The main point I would like to get across at this committee hearing<br>is that I do not believe it would be to the best interests of this country<br>to have the exchange with England or with any other country go to<br>the point where it interferes with our own work, because then we would<br>not have anything and we would not have anything to give them either.</p>
<p>That is the real serious part of it as far as I am concerned, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrors. Are you speaking of the economic phase of this<br>relationship or are you speaking now in terms of the national security<br>of the Nation ?</p>
<p>I will tell you very frankly the reason why I was anxious to have you<br>come, Admiral, is because I think some time back, at one of the pre-<br>vious hearings, I had the staff look it up. My name does not appear<br>to be on this page in the book they handed me, but I think I asked this<br>question, I do not want to begin reading all of this, but I can recapitu-<br>late now because I remember quite vividly. I think in your testimony<br>in a previous hearing you brought out the fact that in your opinion we<br>were much farther advanced than Russia was in this whole technology<br>and knowledge of submarines being propelled by atomic energy.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. And you said that one of the worst things that we<br>could do was to behave ourselves in such a way so that the Russians<br>would get some of our secrets with regard to this, which would be<br>injurious to the national security. Did you not say that?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. ;</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Predicated upon that, I thought you should ex-<br>plore this a little further because the President has said on various<br>occasions, in speaking about this relationship with Great Britain,<br>or what have we, that much of what we are giving the Russians<br>already have, and for that reason there is not too much of a risk<br>involved, because here we are imparting information that is generally<br>known by our supposed-to-be adversary, and therefore we conse-<br>quently cause ourselves no damage or jeopardize in no way our na-<br>tional security if at least we impart some of this information to our<br>friends and our allies, which in fact really solidifies our military<br>posture in insuring the security of our own Nation.</p>
<p>In line with that pronouncement—and I do not say it was made<br>by the President to the extent that he would include or exclude what<br>we are talking about now, particularly on this phase of the Nautilus<br>submarine. But in view of that, do you feel there is something here<br>where we must exercise extreme prudence in the exchange of this<br>information, whether it be with the United Kingdom, France, or<br>any other country, to the extent that if we are not pretty careful<br>here, we may actually be opening up a Pandora’s box in jeopardizing<br>the security of this Nation?</p>
<p>I would like to get your frank views on that because I think that<br>is the important part. I do not think we are as much concerned<br>insofar as this arrangement is concerned because this has to do with<br>the military aspects. I think we can strike up agreements to effect<br>that anything they learn cannot be used for peaceful development.<br>But the important point here is: Will we be giving away or.taking<br>the chance of giving away, unless we have the proper security safe-<br>guards, something that would be dangerous to us insofar as our<br>national security is concerned</p>
<p>oo</p>
<p>»</p>
<p>164 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovrr. Senator Pastore, if you will permit, I would<br>like very briefly to complete what I wanted! to say, then get on to<br>this latter subject. Is that all right, sir? :</p>
<p>: Senator Pasrore. Yes, you do it any way you want to..</p>
<p>. Admiral Rroxover. On the first part, I hope in the legislation there<br>is some provision that in.any exchange of information it is not done<br>to the detriment of our own program. You see, I am in this fix: I<br>am not only responsible, sir, for designing and developing reactors,<br>I am responsible for getting naval vessels out on time. That-is a<br>lot different from building research reactors or something similar.<br>So if agreements are made or arrangements are made between two<br>countries which may involve this exchange, I think it would bo ad-<br>visable that the man such as myself, whoever. has my position, is<br>consulted to find out what impact this is going to have on getting<br>our own ships out. . .</p>
<p>. I think that is the important point from my standpoint, and I<br>would recommend there be something in the agreement or in the leg-<br>islation that provides for this.</p>
<p>When I was over in England about a month ago I took this matter -</p>
<p>_up with them, and I think their top officials agreed to,this. They</p>
<p>agreed that they cannot push the exchange to the extent of hamper-.</p>
<p>ing our own efforts. But as you get further down into the indus-</p>
<p>trial organizations, some of them are looking to get detailed infor-</p>
<p>mation instead of either buying or copying what we do. They want<br>to use a lot of our time which we need to devote to our own problems</p>
<p>and which does not basically help them to get their own job done<br>ast.</p>
<p>That is what I am concerned about,</p>
<p>About 2 months ago the British naval attaché delivered an un-<br>signed, undated letter to the Navy Department, stating they were<br>not getting adequate information from us. We finally resolved that<br>issue, and we got the British to agree they were getting adequate<br>information. Lo and behold, as soon as they agreed to that with the<br>Navy Department, it was taken up with the Atomic Energy Com-<br>mission, the same thing, “ =</p>
<p>That raises another point. I think one of the reasons why we may<br>not be getting as much information as we could from the British is<br>because there are too many groups in this country they can deal<br>with.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. I just gave you a case. They took up a prob-<br>lem with the Navy and got it resolved, and the British admitted they<br>were. getting all the information. I think Admiral Mountbatten<br>wrote to ‘Admiral Burke and told him that. As soon as that was<br>complete, then the same thing was taken up with the Atomic Energy<br>Commission and we had to go through the same issue all over again.</p>
<p>I only have a certain amount of time, and if all my time is taken<br>up in fighting things off, then I get in the same position Mr. Dulles is<br>m.. Mr. Acheson accused him the other day of exercising his job of his<br>in a manner that kept bad things from happening, and that he did<br>not do a lot of good things- More and more, my time is taken up in<br>keeping bad. things. from. happening ‘instead of doing good things,<br>and that is not good because it is a purely a negative thing: - :</p>

I strongly urge that the people who have to carry these things out<br>be consulted in the beginning as to what the significance or what the<br>impact is of these agreements, particularly in a case like mine where<br>J: have to deliver ships on time. :<br>Chairman Dura.

I want it brought out here, I want the’ clear<br>understanding in the record, there is not a blessed thing we can write<br>in the law to carry out this problem that you have pointed out.

You can do this, though: “You do have the<br>concept of congressional intent that is indicated by the statement of<br>the cognizant committee. I think that is probably as far as you can</p>

<p>“Senator Pastors. You mean in our report? sot<br>- Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir, in your report. I think that would<br>cover it. , ’ ;</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvr. Mr. Chairman?</p>
<p>“Senator Pastors, Mr. Van Zandt. :</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvt. Admiral, let me ask you a few ques<br>tions now. Is it not true that the British are good ‘submariners? :</p>
<p>Admiral Ricnover. Yes, sir; they are.</p>
<p>Representative VAN ZANDT. Do we get any information from the<br>British: that is helpful to our submarine rogram? I am not talk-<br>ing about nuclear power, I am talking about conventional subma-<br>rines.. —</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rrcxover. I believe in making it broader than that. The<br>British have been very helpful in concepts for the design and con-<br>struction of naval vessels. It so happens in the particular feature<br>of miclear power we have not gotten anything. ‘They do not have<br>anything to give us.</p>

<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. No, sir, if I confine myself to nuclear power,<br>there is at present no contribution they have that is evident at this<br>time to our program. I am not saying they do not help us on other<br>phases of ‘naval vessels or other military activities. :</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvr. I am thinking now of what may de-<br>velop in the British Navy once they receive this technical informa-<br>tion as to the state of the art that they receive from you. Do you<br>ibink that the British Navy may finally develop a segment of their<br>submarine force that could make a contribution to the construction<br>of nuclear powered submarines? - mr an :</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. They might years from‘now, sir, ‘I would like<br>to make it clear that I am definitely for exchanging the submarine</p>
<p>166 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>information with the British. I want to be sure that is in the record.<br>And they have agreed that I have helped them considerably. When<br>I was there about a month ago I suggested to them, and they have<br>bought, the idea that they would make a commercial arrangement<br>with one of our companies to buy a complete submarine propulsion<br>plant from an American company on a purely commercial relation-<br>ship, and install it themselves in the submarine they are building in<br>England. They are currently spending about $7 million a year on<br>their nuclear submarine development, and at that rate it will take<br>many, many years before they are ready.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvr. One more question and then I am<br>through. Would it be possible to set up an arrangement with the<br>Navy Department to transmit this technical information they want so<br>as to keep them out of your hair?</p>
<p>Admiral Riorover. No; you cannot. It is not a case of transmit-<br>ting technical information; that takes some time, but that is not the<br>gist of it, sir. The gist of it is they would like to station people all<br>over—in my office, In every laboratory—and be right there all the<br>time getting every question answered. That means a great deal of<br>extra work for our people, and we cannot do that and keep on with<br>our own job. This was why I recommended to them and they agreed<br>with the idea of procuring by commercial arrangement a complete<br>plant, on the condition they keep out of our laboratories, and let<br>the American firm and let them handle the matter for them. I think<br>they are going to request this, but this of course involves a change in<br>the 1954 act.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. I have one more question, Mr. Chair-</p>
<p>an.</p>
<p>(Classified question and answer deleted.)</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. Thatis all, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>Serfator Pastors. Mr. Hosmer.</p>
<p>. Representative Hosmer. I want to get this straight in my own mind.<br>You favor this exchange of information ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. I am talking about exchange with<br>the British, sir. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But you have an apprehension that some-<br>where in the process it will become such an extensive thing that, in-<br>stead of carrying out a nuclear submarine program for the United<br>States, you will ‘be, and your people will be spending their time ex-<br>changing information with the British ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There has to be some interference, sir; you can-<br>not do anything without some interference. But it can be done in a<br>reasonable way so it does not interfere too much.</p>
<p>Representative Hosarer. If they are down in the laboratory asking<br>your men about these little details all the time, your men are not<br>doing their job?.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. And that was not the intent of the exchange.<br>The intent was the exchange of scientific and technical information.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. On the extent of the exchange, you say the<br>British do not have the nuclear information, but you visualize it as<br>as exchange of information regarding, say, the whole submarine, not<br>just the engine, the whole features? uo</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 167</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would go further than that. Weare acting as<br>one government relative to another. I think we should consider all<br>nuclear power information, whether it is submarine or otherwise.<br>We are interested in getting everything, and this——</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. And nonnuclear information, too?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would like to confine myself to nuclear<br>information because otherwise you get into too many ramifications.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. T mean insofar as getting from them. if<br>they have not got nuclear information to exchange, they ought to ex-<br>change broadly other technologies.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. They have other nuclear power information.<br>As I said, one of the difficulties is that there are too many avenues<br>by which we give this information: one United States agency can<br>give information away without reference to the other, and thereby we<br>lose bargaining power all over. So I think it ought to be set up in<br>such manner that when we decide what we want and they decide<br>what they want, it is done through one central place. So that, for<br>instance, if we give them information on submarines and if we need<br>information nuclearwise on something else, we ought to use what we<br>give asa bargaining power.</p>
<p>Chairman Duruam. In other words, they ought to deal either with<br>the Navy or the AEC?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. I would have them deal with the AEG, sir, I<br>think that is the logical place.</p>
<p>Chairman Durnam. They are not doing that at the present time<br>then ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. They are doing it through both.</p>
<p>Chairman Duruam. I think that should be worked in agreement<br>with the British so we would not have them running all over the lot<br>here interrupting everybody, because there is no excuse for going to<br>every different agency of the Government.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. You do favor an exchange of information with<br>relation to nuclear-propelled submarines with Great Britain ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. For the purposes of the record, tell us why.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rrcxover. There are probably no two countries in the<br>world that have as similar a cultural and legal and political back-<br>ground and are the same kind of people. I think they are robably<br>the most reliable outpost in Europe as far as we are concerned, and we<br>are in asense helping ourselves, too. This is a policy matter really.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. We are more than in a sense; we are actually<br>helping our military posture,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. This is really not for me to decide. This is a<br>matter of national policy. You are asking me my personal opinion,<br>and I think it is exactly the right thing to do. Iam all for it.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. The reason Lask you the question, Admiral Rick-<br>over, is because you are, I might say, the most learned in this particu-<br>lar field as far as I know. I do not mean that just to pay you any<br>plaudits. But inasmuch as you have worked with Great Britain,<br>realizing what the future is in this type of submarine, I think itisa fair<br>question to ask you whether or not we will be stronger with their help<br>than we would be doing it alone.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>168 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>_ -Admiral Ricxover. We will be stronger, sir.<br>. Senator Pastors. Thank you. Loo<br>Representative Van Zanvr. Would it be proper to say, Admiral, if<br>we permit them, however, to flood you with requests for technical<br>information, details, and so forth, that we could sap the strength away<br>that results from the exchange? . ;<br>Admiral Ricxover. It is my considered opinion that, if this ex-<br>change is carried out in the spirit which exists at the top, both in the<br>Atomic Energy Commisison and in the Admiralty, that there will be<br>no interference. But by the time it filters down, you get other inter-<br>ests andramifications init. ~ :<br>Chairman Duruam. Do you apply that same statement to the<br>French? a<br>Adiniral Ricxover. No, sir. I would like to discuss exchange with<br>other countries as a separate matter. , J<br>Representative Van Zanvr. I have one more guestion on the British.<br>The British are interested in the development of a nuclear powerplant<br>for a merchant ship. This information that they get from the ¥ aie-<br>téJus and the Seawolf and others, would not that be helpful to them in<br>the merchant ship? wt<br>Admiral Rrosover. Yes, sir; they could take the Vauédlus plant and.<br>place it in a merchant ship. na<br>* Representative Van ZANDT. Do they get information from the Mari-,<br>time Commission or do they have to come to the Atomic Energic Com-<br>mission for this information ? _<br>Admiral Rrcxover. The way it is now they have to come to the<br>AEC to get this information. ;<br>Mr. Frenps. You are talking of the nuclear-propulsion part?<br>- Admiral Ricxover. I am talking of the nuclear-propulsion party |<br>. Again I strongly recommend this whole exchange be centralized in’<br>the AEC. fe<br>There is another reason, sir, I have not mentioned. The AEC has,<br>a staff of permanent people who are there all the time. In the Depart-’<br>ment of Defense the people who deal with this problem are shifting<br>all the time and constantly being changed. For example, one of the<br>big advantages that industry has in working with the Government, is,<br>that they have. the same people dealing with the Government all the<br>time, but the people in the Government change every 2 or 3 years. And<br>this is the situation you run into. And a great deal of my difficulty is’<br>that the people who are initally dealing with the British do not undér-<br>stand all of the aspects of the problem, and so finally when it filters.<br>down to.us, we are the last man on the totem pole and we have to make’</p>
<p>good there. At the same time I am under pressure from our own. Gov- .</p>
<p>ernment to get our own ships out.</p>
<p>Chairman Duruam. You said you wanted to explore this other part.&quot;</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. That was the second question.<br>Senator Pastore: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. As far as exchange with other countries. —</p>
<p>-Twould first like to state briefly why - think that nuclear submarines :<br>are important. I will do this very briefly, and particularly in light of’</p>
<p>recent tests we have run.</p>
<p>We now have three nuclear submarines at sea operating and getting |</p>
<p>a great deal of technical and tactical information.</p>
<p>a te ener</p>
<p>L(y</p>
<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 169</p>
<p>It appears as of today there are two main reasons for the importance<br>of nuclear-powered su marines. One, and in my opinion by far the<br>more important one, is its use to kill oif enemy submarines carrying<br>missiles which can approach our coast and fire these missiles.</p>
<p>The second use, of course, is for submarines carrying missiles. This<br>has been discussed in the papers and before Congress, and I believe<br>you know the importance—that we are developing missiles which will<br>zo about 1,500 miles, and with that range we could reach most any<br>part of the world, particularly from Arctic regions.</p>
<p>We now get into the problem of countries other than Great Britain.</p>
<p>As you well know, there are strong Communist elements in some of<br>these countries, and it is easily possible to compromise this informa-<br>tion. And I cannot decide what the policy is. ‘That is something<br>that is beyond my function. It is the function of the administration<br>as to whether this is done or not. But T must utter a very, very stern<br>note of caution: Be careful as long as we do not know whether the<br>Russians have nuclear-powered submarines—that we do not take steps<br>to give this information away too soon.</p>
<p>You will have to assume that as soon as you start in handing this<br>information out to any other country you lose control, and in some<br>cases you lose greater control than others. I think this is the con-<br>sideration that should govern. There are other ways of accomplish-<br>ing the purpose of helping countries. We might even station, in time;<br>our own nuclear submarines at foreign bases to help them.</p>
<p>But my private opinion is that we should be very careful about<br>extending this exchange of submarine nuclear information to any<br>other country besides Britain.</p>
<p>“Fyrom what evidence we have of what the U. S. S. R. has done on<br>more central station atomic powerplants, I think they have put up<br>more of a propaganda stunt than actual performance nuclear power.</p>
<p>For example, their so-called 5,000 kilowatt reactor, which went in<br>operation about a year after the prototype of the V autilus, actually<br>has only operated at 2,000 kilowatts, From our standpoint it would be<br>considered primitively built. I think they just decided that they have<br>enough coal, have enough oil, that it was not advisable for them to<br>divert this vast effort; however, they would make as much propaganda<br>benefit as they could, but would really not go to the extent of com-<br>mitting a rather large portion of their industry on 1t.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Again speculating, if a reactor of the Vautilus<br>type fell into their hands through some carelessness on the part of<br>Guo of our collaborators, we would be in a devil of a fix, would we not?<br>We might change that attitude? ; ;</p>
<p>- Admiral Rrcxover. The tendency to too much publication in this<br>country hurts us. .</p>
<p>As you know, I have been a strong proponent of declassification<br>of reactor technology, but at the same time I think we are going way<br>too far on some of the military items. We ought to identify certain<br>military items and say these today are important to our national<br>security.</p>
<p>T know Admiral Strauss believes this. He smiled at me when I<br>said that. . .</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. He even nodded. ‘You cannot get the nod in<br>the record, but it was affirmative.</p>
<p>Mr. Srnavss. I would agree. .</p>
<p>170 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvr. To me this is one of the most impor-<br>tant items in this bill. It is probably because of the time I spent on the<br>research and development subcommittee here.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. My next question is on the icebreaker.<br>Woe were told they were going to launch the icebreaker in December.<br>I think they launched it either in late December or early January.<br>Was it early January?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. It was November. Their national—— -</p>
<p>Represeritative Van Zanpr. November 7, the revolution anniversary.<br>That is right. ;</p>
<p>Somewhere we picked up information they were having trouble in the<br>development of the propulsion as it relates to the reactor.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricrover. I have not seen that.</p>
<p>Do you want my opinion about this icebreaker ?</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpvr. Yes.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. I do not see much point to spend a lot of money,<br>particularly in a poor country like Russia, to start off on an icebreaker<br>except they want to demonstrate peaceful intent and show that they are<br>doing something. So they picked a ship which is much easier than a<br>submarine, which from a straight.military standpoint obviously would<br>be the best one. Furthermore, in an icebreaker you could install a<br>very large unit where you do not have to refine your engineering as you<br>do on the submarine.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do not want to get in the position that we are<br>always 5 years ahead of them as we always were on the atomic bomb.<br>That is another danger—that you can delude yourself.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanvt. The point I am trying to develop, Ad-<br>miral, if we are going to protect information, that should be in the<br>engineering phase of the nuclear power submarine.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovrr. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. Would you tell us what was the ex-<br>perience of the Seawwol recently ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I wonder if I could tall off the record.</p>
<p>Senator Pastorr. Yes.</p>
<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. People are finally beginning to realize the<br>nuclear submarine is valuable as a new weapon. I think as we try<br>them out more we are going to Jearn that their value is even greater.<br>So again this is another reason for making sure we do not jeopardize<br>our lead unnecessarily.</p>
<p>I cannot set the policy, sir. There are a number of people in this<br>country who understand what has to be done along that line more than<br>Ido, From the standpoint of the technical, and what I know these<br>ships are doing for the Navy, and I would exercise great caution in<br>what you gave away to other countries. J am very, very serious about<br>that.</p>
<p>Chairman Durwam. Of course, Admiral, the thing that worries all<br>of us and worries me is the question of treating the allies different<br>one from the other. Wo not only face it in this phase of information,<br>but wo are going to face it in all other phases of the information we<br>want to exchange. Now we have to do it one way or the other. We<br>have either got to go out and treat them all alike or we have got to<br>pick out our special babies and treat them as we want to with some<br>confidence. I think that is done anyway from day to day.</p>
<p>i er mmr - ee ee -</p>
<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 171</p>
<p>In applying it across the board to all the other information, do<br>you have the same opinion in the treatment of other allies as you do<br>on this phase of the information? Because we are going to get into<br>the weapons, we are going to get into all the other technical lmow-<br>how, and everything else that enters into this field of security with<br>these countries of Western Europe. That is our primary purpose in<br>this whole thing.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Of course, Mr. Durham, that is the great dilem-<br>ma. If things were so simple in life that you could say Guatemala<br>is an ally, Great Britain is an ally, we should treat them all the same,<br>then there is no use for having this committee.</p>
<p>Chairman Dournam, When you put allies together, though, you<br>put them together on the basis of some purpose.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Then you have to weigh, sir, what the potential<br>advantages are against the potential losses. And that is true of any<br>secret information.</p>
<p>Chairman Duruam. Then it reverts to the question of why we have<br>them picked to begin with.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. As allies?</p>
<p>Chiirman Duruam. Yes. Why have them in there if they are not<br>worth treating properly like the rest of them? We face that question.<br>I lmow I do.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think you have to face that question. You<br>know, frankly, the way it worked out with England, we have not<br>given them everything.</p>
<p>Chairman Duruam. I know we have not.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It is a gradual proposition. I would like to<br>say again, sir, there are people in the executive branch of the Govern-<br>ment, in the State Department and the administration, who know<br>those problems better than I do and have a better feeling for this, and<br>their decision must govern that.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Before you get off that subject, though, Ad-<br>miral—Admiral Strauss is here, and I think it is a fair question to<br>ask, and if it is not fair, you can tell me so. But insofar as Great<br>Britain is concerned, you say we have not given them everything.<br>We are contemplating through the amending of this law that we<br>will enter into a bilateral agreement whereby they will receive design<br>information to the extent they could put’a Vautilus together them-<br>selves. Is that not so?</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss. Yes.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. That is correct. I want that inthe record. Let’s<br>not fool ourselves now. That is why we are here.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxoven. But we did not give them this information<br>from the very beginning. Mr. Durham raised the hypothetical point<br>that we have allies and why do not we give them everything equally.<br>What I answered was that we did not even give the English every-<br>thing right off. It took a period of time until we assured ourselves<br>about their security, and then we gradually gave them the informa-<br>tion, Probably we have to go through some procedure of that kind<br>with other countries. But we knew from the very beginning that we<br>were closer politically, culturally, and in many other ways with the<br>British than we were with other countries, and that is why we treated<br>them differently from the other countries. ; ‘</p>

<p>Admiral Ricxover. They cannot give us ‘any because they do not<br>have it. . 7</p>

<p>Adiniral Ricrover. I think I mentioned that before. I would think<br>the exchange of —</p>
<p>Senator Pastors. I want you to say it again.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would consider the exchange of nuclear in-<br>formation. on an overall basis. It would not make any difference to<br>me what. I do not think there should be reciprocity on one. If we</p>
<p>give them anything they need, we should be able to get something</p>
<p>in return, -</p>
<p>For instance, if we give them submarine information and they do<br>not have, then they should give us information on their civilian power<br>program. ,</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. That question came up with Mr. Vance -yester-<br>day, and I think hé answered quite logically and intelligently when<br>he said, “Well, you cannot compel a private corporation to give in-<br>formation through its government just because its government feels<br>its relationship with another country. I do not think Westinghouse<br>or General Electric would do the same thing in America.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. No, Senator. It is a well-recognized principle<br>of international relations that, when one country makes an agreement<br>with another, it is not the concern of the country that it is not the<br>concern of the country that is not getting something to worry about</p>
<p>-the internal relations and constitutional law of the other country. We</p>
<p>have had many examples in the United States of that same thing,<br>where we make treaties which were not lived up to by our States, but<br>the Federal Government had to make good. .</p>
<p>For instance, we had a case in 1891 where some aliens did not re-<br>ceive proper police treatment and justice in the State courts or in the<br>local courts. The President of the United States said it was his<br>pleasure and his duty to make good to the foreign government; that<br>it was not their concern about our local problems. We, as a consti-</p>
<p>‘tutional state, have that same problem all the time.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. You do not think it is a bad idea to explore the</p>
<p>‘possibilities of reciprocity ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rionover. If we make an agreement with the British to</p>
<p>-exchange information, and we do our part, it is not consistent with<br>good international relations or practice for them to claim they cannot</p>
<p>carry out there part of the agreement because of their local constitu-<br>tional principles they cannot do that. This is what the British have<br>ey have been using this excuse. We should require them</p>
<p>to treat us as equals, if the primary object of this exchange is to con-</p>

<p>Senator Pastore. We thank you.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Thank you.</p>
<p>Senator Pastors. Admiral Strauss, I think you are next.</p>
<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Admiral Strauss.</p>
<p>Mr. Srravuss. Mr. Chairman, in further response to the questions<br>that were asked at the last hearing of your subcommittee on this<br>subject, we have prepared and have transmitted to you two documents.<br>They are lengthy. am wondering whether you want to have them<br>read, or whether you want to proceed with questions. It may be a<br>bore to you if you have read them.</p>
<p>Senator Pastors. We got them late yesterday, and I do not think<br>anyone on this committee has read them. If your testimony is direct<br>to this document, then I think we ought to have it read, because that<br>is the only way we will follow you.</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss. Very well, sir. I will ask some of the Commissioners<br>to spell me in this because I may give out.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Any way you arrange it, it is all right.</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. I am taking the shorter of the documents first.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Well, you are the Chairman. [ Laughter. ]</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. It is entitled “Proposed Responses to Four Additional<br>Questions Contained in Senator Pastore’s Letter.”</p>
<p>T have received your letter of February 13, 1958, pointing out cer-<br>tain questions of further interest to the committee. You ask that I<br>be prepared to answer these today. This I shall do, first reading the<br>questions and then giving the answers.</p>
<p>Question No. 1. What specific information and material has Great<br>Britain and/or other countries requested to date which, because of the<br>present law, the United States has not been able to transfer ?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>‘A. 1, I shaJl respond to this question in three parts: First, the com-<br>munication of atomic weapon information under section 144 b.;<br>second, communication of nonweapons military information under<br>section 144 a.; third the transfor of materials for military purposes</p>
<p>B. 1. As to the communication of atomic weapon information: The<br>Department of Defense is, of course, the agency which receives re-</p>
<p>uests from and makes transmittals of information to foreign na-<br>tions or regional defense organizations under the provisions of section</p>
<p>ee ee renee</p>
<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 17a</p>
<p>144 b. Therefore a detailed answer to this qustion must come from<br>the Department of Defense and you have forwarded a copy of your<br>letter of February 13, 1958, to the Department of Defense. We have<br>coordinated our response with General Loper, who is to testify later<br>and he will be prepared to discuss this matter further at that time,<br>should you desire.</p>
<p>2. We can report, generally speaking, that the Department of De-<br>fense has requested the Atomic Energy Commission to join in joint<br>determination to transmit to the United Kingdom certain thermo-<br>nuclear weapons information for compatibility purposes which, even<br>though concerning only external characteristics, yields, and delivery<br>systems, was judged by the Commission at the time the transmission<br>was proposed to reveal to the United Kingdom “important informa-<br>tion concerning the design or fabrication of the nuclear components<br>of an atomic weapon.” “More specifically, it was the opinion of the<br>Commission that because of the provision of section 144 b. the United<br>States could not.transmit compatibility information concerning cer-<br>tain nuclear weapons to the United Kingdom during the period ex-<br>tending from the summer of 1955 into the fall of 1957. 4</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. When you speak of compatibility here, are you<br>also talking about deliverability? 7</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. Conipatibility in the sense, Senator, of ‘being’ com-<br>patible with their weapons system, compatible with the plane, com-<br>patible with the missile to fit it, to be able to be transported by it, to<br>be able to be handled, in the case of a plane, by the crew in the plane,<br>to arm it, to release it, et cetera. . -</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Would this also include a warhead, let’s say, on<br>existing: missiles they might have? .</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss. It would.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. At this particular point now, how much<br>information did we get from the British concerning their weapon de-<br>velopment as well as their tests in the Pacific.</p>
<p>r. Strauss. We had observers at their tests. It is impossible for<br>me, My, Van Zandt, to say how much quantitatively, We could pro-<br>vide you with it.</p>
<p>Representative Van ZanpT. Generalize then.</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. If you desired it, with a report. made by our people<br>who returned from the tests. Perhaps, if you will permit me, I will<br>ask General Starbird if he would attempt to answer that question.</p>
<p>General Srarsmp. Generally what they saw at the tests was‘un-<br>classified information. However, the British have given to-the De-<br>partment of Defense certain information as to the design of weapons<br>that they are producing. It is generally of the same type of informa-<br>tion as we have given to them—such things as&#x27;size, weight, and yield.<br>K Chairman Doruax. Is that-inormation transferred directly to the</p>
<p>it . 7 . &quot;oa Tt oa</p>
<p>General Starsinp. That information is transmitted.to-the Depart-<br>ment of Defense, sir. , . ‘</p>
<p>: Chairman Duruanx. And not to the AEC? - oY<br>. General Starsmo. Not to the AEC. mo,</p>
<p>Chairman Dora. How do you get it to the laboratories then?</p>
<p>‘ General. Srarsimp. We are receiving that from the Department:of<br>Detense, and we-do inform our laboratory directors of. what: is re-<br>ceived.</p>
<p>175 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. This information that they made avail-<br>able to us, does it contain any information that would indicate that<br>they make a different approach or new approach from what we are<br>making?</p>
<p>General Srarsirv. [Deleted.]</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Let me ask a question on this point. Going back<br>to the bottom of page 2 that you have been reading, if I read this<br>correctly.</p>
<p>It does remain your considered opinion that without a basic amend-<br>ment to the 1954 Jaw, as you are suggesting now, you could not carry<br>on the objectives you contemplated through the interpretation made<br>here ¢</p>
<p>Mr. Srrauss. That is correct.</p>
<p>Chairman Durtam. Point out what you could not do under this.<br>What type of thing would it be?</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. I am sorry.</p>
<p>Chapman Durnam. What would it be outside of something like</p>
<p>Mr. Srrauss. There might be other weapons. I believe that the next<br>paragraphs, 4 and 5, bear upon that, and if they leave a question in<br>your mind when I complete them, may I try to answer it then.</p>
<p>4, In addition, the Department of Defense quite recently requested<br>that certain information (yields, delivery vehicles and fusing options)<br>of be transmitted to NATO for planning purposes.</p>
<p>Chairman Durnam. All of the NATO countries would sit in on that<br>conference for information purposes ; is that correct?</p>
<p>Mr. Srrauss. For planning purposes, I presume so. Let me tell<br>you what we decided.</p>
<p>That is to say that under the present law we could not accede with<br>the request of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Insofar as that request for NATO is concerned 4</p>
<p>Mr. Srrauss. Right.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. But if you were dealing by way of bilateral with<br>the United Kingdom alone, maybe it could have been ?</p>
<p>Mr. Srravuss. Well the is not included in the type weapon<br>we have as yet exchanged information with the British on. So that<br>has not been done.</p>
<p>Representative Van ZAnpr. What was the decision in the Depart-<br>ment of Defense after you advised against the transmission 4</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. This cannot be done unilaterally; we have to agree.<br>So that there was no transfer of such information.</p>
<p>General Starbird will amplify that answer.</p>
<p>General Srarsirp. The Department of Defense asked us again re-<br>cently to join in a joint determination on as much as possible, but in<br>my discussions they indicated that they still needed to transmit all as<br>soon as practical, and as soon as the law was modified, if it would per-<br>mit, then they would ask that the remainder be transmitted.</p>
<p>Representative Van ZANnpr. Tn other words, their position, then, was<br>that they recognized the provisions of existing law did not permit<br>the AEC to approve the transmission of this information to NATO<br>countries ?</p>
<p>General Srarsirv. That is not quite right, sir. They recognized<br>that there is a full basis for the interpretation that we make of the</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>{&gt;</p>
<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 177</p>
<p>law; that, therefore, under the law where ‘the two parties have to in-<br>terpret and agree before you can do something; that the action cannot<br>be-taken. . .. so .<br>Representative Van Zanpr. All right. - .<br>..Mr. Srravss. I think they disagree with. our-interpretation, Mr.<br>Van, Zandt, but the fact that we are entitled.to our interpretation and<br>that is a sufficient block on the transfer is accepted. .<br>., Senator Pastore. Which points up another necessity for the amend-<br>ing of the law.. . ee ;<br>‘Mr. Srravss. I think so, Mr. Chairman.. 7°. _-<br>... Representative. Van Zanor. I am‘ going to say I am glad to get this<br>information, because here is.a good illustration.of the machinery of<br>the law in operation. . Le to ;<br>-Mr. Srrauss. It.is effective. Naturally, if one is on the side where<br>there is a tendency to be more liberal, undoubtedly there is the feeling</p>
<p>that 2 misinterpretation has been made.which will exist.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. I might say at this juncture, and I am not trying<br>to be complimentary, but I am trying to.bestill some of the fears and<br>apprehensioris on the part of some people, that this is a classic ex-<br>ample .of the caution being exercised with regard to the administra-<br>tion of the law. Loe :</p>
<p>. Representative Vaw Zanpr. That is right.” .<br>Senator Pasrors. That is my personal: point. of view, and I feel<br>compelled to say it. : tom<br>Representative Van Zanpr. I join the gentleman. It delights me.<br>~ Senator Pastors. If this actually oceurred where the Department<br>of Defense had asked for this transmittal and the hesitation was only<br>because of the opinion expressed by the Atomic Energy Commission,<br>and it did not take place because they felt it, might be a violation of<br>law, this is a classic example of caution, :<br>_:Mr..Srravss. As I have stated, my answer has been only a partial<br>response to question No. 1 as it relates to communication of atomic<br>weapons information and I understand greater detail will be included<br>in the testimony of General Loper. ha</p>
<p>C. 1: As to the communication of nonweapons military: informa-<br>tion: Military information, other than that concerning atomic<br>weapons, has been transmitted under section 1440 and concerns sub-<br>marie propulsion reactors and power reactors. . We have negotiated<br>agreements for cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada and<br>our cooperation in the nonweapons milita information area has been<br>restricted to these nations, Neither the. nited Kingdom nor Canada<br>has made any request, for exchange of nonweapons military informa-<br>tion that could not be transmitted under the existing agreements.</p>
<p>. (Off the record discussion.) ee .</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. Let me assure you.you can do certain things. For<br>example—I may have related this—— ....-:-</p>
<p>&#x27;. Senator Pastore. The only difference in the analogy you have given<br>is basically this: No..1, under existing law you could not reveal exist-<br>: Mr. Srravss.Thatisright. Oa tee, Ty ves<br>_ Senator Pastors. Not only that, you are not up against the proposi-</p>

<p>Your real dilemma is going to be—you have not answered the ques-</p>
<p>tion and I said I would if you did not. (Referring to discussion off</p>
<p>the record.) First of all, 1t would have been foolish to answer tho<br>question before we amended the law. We do not know if the Congress<br>is going to go along with the idea of sharing the information. Your<br>trouble is going to arise once the law is amended, once you have the<br>bilateral with Great Britain, You are on the horns of a dilemma<br>when that happens. You can imagine, as Mr. Durham brought out,<br>the insistence on the part of France once you have entered an agree-<br>ment with the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I submit you can diplomatically remain silent and sidestep and<br>skirt around this thing up until you sign an agreement with the<br>United Kingdom, but once you have signed an agreement with the<br>‘United Kingdom you are going to be faced with the cold, stark fact:<br>Here is another ally in NATO that thinks she has a potentiality in<br>this field that is going to request information on the Nautilus sub-</p>
<p>_ marine. And I do not know how you are going to do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. Other countries know we are exchanging information<br>with the British on the Vautilus-type submarine now.</p>
<p>Chairman Durnam. You are going to have to be a good diplomat.</p>
<p>(Classified discussion.)</p>
<p>Mr. Srnavss. 3. I have discussed with you on several occasions our<br>recent meetings with the British, wherein the United Kingdom rep-<br>resentatives pressed for the development of plans for a rather broad<br>interchange of atomic energy information in the military area con-<br>tingent, upon changes of the Atomic Energy Act. However, in these<br>discussions no agreements were made nor do there exist any specific<br>or implied commitments pending amendment of the act.</p>
<p>Senator Pastroru. But genoral areas do?</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. Lamsorry. Ido not understand.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. I mean understanding on general areas. Do<br>they exist?</p>
<p>Mr. Srravuss. No. They understand what the act seeks to achieve,<br>and if the amendments become enacted, we’ will then sit down and<br>discuss with them details in those areas. That is right; yes, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Srrauss. But we have declined up until now, and they have<br>not pressed us unduly. -</p>
<p>I might add also, for the record, that the item to which Admiral<br>Rickover referred, namely the fact that the British Admiralty has<br>pressured the Department of Defense and later the Commission in<br>an unsigned communication, the British Ambassador here stated that<br>that was a mistake and asked that we disregard it. JI accept that at<br>face value—that they had not intended to pressure us or to complain<br>at the degree of exchange of information on the Vautilus.</p>
<p>D. 1. to the transfer of materials for military purposes: No<br>special nuclear material may be furnished presently to another nation<br>for military purposes because the act requires a guaranty that any<br>material furnished under an agreement for cooperation not be used<br>for any military purpose; however, both the United Kingdom and<br>France have indicated an interest in such transfer of United States<br>materials. -</p>
<p>4. We have avoided any commitment regarding either of these<br>statements of interest in United States materials.</p>

<p>AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954 179</p>
<p>E. 1. Summary: I want to say in closing my remarks relative to<br>your first question that tho representatives of many countries are<br>very familiar with the Atomic Energy Act, particularly the provi-<br>sions against use of materials for military purposes. This fact has<br>undoubtedly held back specific requests.</p>
<p>&#x27;’ And that points, up Mr. Durham’s comment that when this is<br>enacted we can expect requests that we have never heard from. He<br>undoubtedly is right. ;</p>
<p>Question No, 2. What specific information and material has your<br>agency desired to transfer to Great Britain and/or other countries,<br>‘but which to date you are unable to transfer because of limitations in<br>the present law?</p>
<p>swer:</p>
<p>A. 1. Here again, the Department of Defense is the agency most</p>
<p>directly concerned with transmission of information under section<br>‘144 b. and the transfer of certain products under the recommended<br>91 ¢. and specific questions in these areas should be directed to tho<br>Department of Defense.<br> 2.°The Commission, of course, believes, and I emphasized in my<br>letter of January 27, 1958, that—<br>there is now a need for broader exchange of information on the part of the United<br>States and its allies than is possible under the present act.<br>Although my letter of January 27 set forth areas of additional military<br>cooperation we believe necessary, the Commission has not considered<br>it advisable to crystallize specific cooperation with particular nations<br>Juntil congressional action on our recommended amendments, Not<br>only has the Commission believed it inadvisable to crystallize specific<br>cooperation, but the present provisions of the act make it difficult to<br>even carry on really fruitful discussions.</p>
<p>3. Tam convinced that it would be to our mutual advantage to engage<br>in a greater interchange of information with the United Kingdom.<br>As I stated in my earlier testimony I believe this must be accompanied.<br>on a step-by-step basis, exploring as we go along the degree of coop-<br>eration ultimately to result. In my response to question No. 1, I dis-<br>cussed the interest of the United Kingdom in the transfer of materials.<br>‘We have not made any decision as to what materials we would like to<br>transfer and in what quantities and under what guaranties and terms.<br>. Senator Pastore. How far can we go in our purposes in being a little<br>more specific and elaborating with reference to 8 which you just read?<br>I mean, assuming the question is put to us as Mr. Durham has sug-<br>gested. I mean that is where our trouble will really rest, as you can<br>understand.</p>
<p>Mr. Srrauss. I do.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. The questions will be very direct—Could you give<br>this tosoand so? Under the law you could, but as we have been talk-<br>ing here, no one ever intended to do such a thing. That is, our present<br>thinkingissuch. How are we going to handle that?</p>
<p>Mr: Strauss. There we would lean very heavily on a proviso in the<br>suggested amendment, which is to promote and not constitute an<br>undue risk to the common defense and security. In other words,<br>there would be empowered to apply a test before making a recom-<br>mendation to the President, and he after receiving our recommenda-</p>
<p>ae ee wee a ee en ee ee 4</p>
<p>180 AMENDING THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954</p>
<p>tion, which would help us turn back undesirable requests for the<br>transmission of information.</p>
<p>Senator Pastors. But I mean insofar as floor activity is concerned.</p>
<p>Mr. Strauss. What your answer is to be?</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. That is right. Put yourself in our position.<br>Take the manager of this bill or these amendments on the floor of the<br>Senate or the floor of the House. We keep talking here about, the<br>diplomatic delicacies involved here. How the devil are you going to<br>become that delicate on the floor of the Senate or the House? | *</p>
<p>Chariman Duruax. In the last sentence in 3 you have “in what<br>quantities and under what guaranties and terms.” We are going to<br>havo to explain that kind of a statement because that goes right to the<br>heart of the question. : . :</p>
<p>You state 3: Doe a</p>
<p>We have not made any decision as to what materials we would like to trausfer<br>and in what quantities and under what guaranties and terms. :<br>That is going to get usin trouble. ot,</p>
<p>Mr: Strauss. ‘The quantities, Mr. Durham—by the use of that phrase,<br>what I meant to imply was we were not going to damage our own pro-<br>gram or impoverish our own program by transferring quantities that<br>would cripple us or in any way impair our ability to fulfill our own<br>needs.</p>
<p>Chairman Duriasr, In other words, we have got to trust somebody.</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. That is unfortunately true. Ifyou have a bookkeeper<br>or teller in a bank, or what not, the trustees or the board of directors at<br>some point or other have to put some confidence in the administrator or<br>make a change in the administrator. mo</p>
<p>Chairman Durnam. Of course, these transfers will be worked out on<br>the basis of the Department of Defense recommendation? * |</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. The Department of Defense recommendation, with the<br>concurrence of the Commission. _</p>
<p>Chairman Duruasr. That is right. But I say it will come to them<br>first on the weapons. ;<br>&quot;Mr. Strauss. On the other hand, the transfer of material for non-<br>&quot;weapons purposes would be a Commission determination, .</p>
<p>Chairman Durwam. I-would assume, for instance, if they wanted 25<br>thermonuclear weapons and all the things that go with it, it would first<br>come to the Department of Defense. ;</p>
<p>’ Mr. Srrauss. That is right. . an</p>
<p>Chairman Durnam. Then it would come to you for determination as<br>to how far you would go? cS,</p>
<p>Mr: Strauss. That is right.</p>
<p>Chairman DurwaM, Finally. Am correct? y</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. That is right. ‘And then the President would have to<br>determine and certify that this transfer would promote and not unduly<br>risk the common defense and security. _ cee ae ggete ot<br>_ Chairman Durga... Would he have to make that finding in writing?</p>

<p>Representative Van ZANpt. Lt is going to be very difficult to satisfy<br>some of the questions that, will develop during this debate. I was<br>thinking, if we did use this information, we might embarrass ourselves<br>as we try to negotiate with countries other than Great Britain.</p>
<p>Mr. Srravss. Let me ask whether my colleagues have any inspira-<br>tion on this subject. Dr. Libby ? :</p>
<p>Dr. Lion. I think you could give an example of that sort in gen-<br>eralterms. You could not get too specific.</p>
<p>_ghairman Durnam. Of course, you understand I want to do this<br>thing. -<br>Dr. Luspy. Yes. I am trying to give an example of how this is<br>actually operated at the present time. oe</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. ‘The reason why I point this up is merely to point<br>up to this group, because I have just thumbed through this state-<br>ment with relation to section 55—and I do not want to get into that<br>at this time—and I am still not satisfied that we are working on an<br>amicable agreement here that is desirable in the face of the attitudes<br>of some of these Members. . Because T am telling you, gentlemen,<br>very, very frankly, that unless we can go out on that floor united,<br>whereby everyone in that center field thinks this is 2 good thing to do<br>and everyone on the committee feels so, L am afraid we are going to<br>be in a very, very tough situation, because the minute we get ques-<br>tioning one another on this committee and begin firing questions to<br>and fro, it is going to be a delicate thing and a hard thing to put<br>through without divulging classified information, which none of<br>us wants to do.</p>
<p>So I am hoping the Commission will bear this in mind, and the<br>administration as well, that this will not be an attitude here: We are<br>asking for everything. You do what you darn please with it, but we<br>still want it. The minute you begin to take that attitude, gentlemen,<br>we are going to have trou le on the floor; because this is one place,<br>because of the very, very sensitive character of this whole matter, that<br>we are going to have to go out of here with 2 united front, Republicans<br>and Democrats, and put this thing over.
