      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman Rickover&#x27;s compelling testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in April 1961 passionately advocates for the immediate adoption of nuclear propulsion for combatant surface ships, particularly frigates over 8,000 tons. He argues that while the initial construction cost of a nuclear frigate is higher (an additional $27-35 million, or roughly 1.5 times the conventional cost amortized over 20 years), the long-term benefits are paramount. Rickover emphasizes the &quot;virtually unlimited high-power endurance&quot; of nuclear ships, citing the *Bainbridge* (nuclear frigate) capable of 150,000-180,000 miles at full power without refueling, compared to under 3,000 miles for conventional frigates, thereby eliminating the need for vulnerable fuel logistics and enabling higher average speeds. He asserts that nuclear ships can be built as fast or faster than conventional ones, and highlights significant past reductions in nuclear core and plant costs (e.g., *Skipjack* core costs down 60%). Rickover contends that Navy and Department of Defense resistance stems from inflated cost perceptions and a fear of reducing total ship numbers, concluding forcefully that any combatant vessel over 8,000 tons built without nuclear power is as &quot;out of date as a crossbow and a sailing ship.&quot;</p>

        <p>Authorizing appropriations for aircraft, missiles, and naval vessels for the armed forces - vss [no. 10]</p>
<p>April 11, 12, 18, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, may 9, and $, 1961.</p>
<p>House or RepresENTATIVES, Commrrrer on Armep SERVICES, | Washington, D.C., Monday, April 24, 1961.</p>
<p>The committee met at 10:10 a.m., Hon. Carl Vinson, chairman of the committee, presiding.</p>
<p>The Cuamman. The meeting will come to order,</p>
<p>This is » continuation of the hearing on section 412 of the bill.</p>
<p>Now, members of the committee, in studying what we have all passed over and considered and after consultation with Mr. Bates and other members of the committee, they raise the point they are of , the opinion that we can properly, in reference to the guided missile: frigates, we can substitute two nuclear powered ships instead of three conventional types and we can do that with the same cost. There will probably be a $10 million increase. | a</p>
<p>Tnatead of having 7 guided missile frigates, we will have 6; 4 being conventional and 2 being nuclear.</p>
<p>I wanted to explore that subject matter. It uppeals to me because I hope the day is-not far distant. when we can have practically all of our ships being built nuclear-powered. As you all know, we only have three ‘such surface ships, an airplane carrier, the cruiser Long Beach, and the Bainbridge.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know we have 48 submarines that are nuclear, I invited the Navy to come up here this morning to testify on this sub- ject and also invited Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>T know our program has been: set up to discuss the missiles of the Air Force this morning and we will get back to that.</p>
<p>I will ask the Air Force to just sit quietly by while I reach a deci- gion in regard to this matter. ’</p>
<p>Now, Admiral James, have you any comments to make on that proposition ?</p>
<p>Admiral James. As we developed in the course of the discussion earlier on this bill, the Navy had in its initial planning the hope to include two nuclear-powered frigates in the program. The budget came out with seven conventional-powered ships that we spoke to previously.</p>
<p>In connection with the matter of costs, it has been stated, and we believe sincerely that you buy about three conventional ships for the price of two nuclear-powered ships of the same type.</p>
<p>In the case of this specific ship, the DLG with an “N” powerplant, ‘t would. bo in the order of a $35 million increased cost for the nucjear. propulsion aspects of it.</p>
<p>There are other.military aspects that are incorporated in the latest DLs that we would like to see incorporated in a DLGN and this brings us to the cost differential of two nuclear ships substituted for three conventional powered ships in this program—an overall cost increase of $10 million above and beyond the $2,915 million that is. being requested in the appropriation bill. co</p>
<p>The Crratmaan. Now, in view of that statement, have you examined your program to see. if any more nuclear ships of the different cate-. gories will be feasible, practically within the same cost? . a an</p>
<p>Admiral Janus. I think, sir, Admiral Rickover is our most quali- fied witness on that subject.</p>
<p>The Cuama«an. L appreciate that, but Iam talking to you now.</p>
<p>Have you gone over other types of ships? ;</p>
<p>Admiral Janes. ‘The program in this area includes DE’s and DEG'’s which are victially the same ship except for missiles and today I believe Admiral Riekover will state that we are not pre- pared with any available nuclear powerplant to put into the hull of this ship or those ships which are of the order of 3,100 tons.</p>
<p>The ship that we are talking to, the DLGN, is of the order of 8,000 tons. It can accommodate, as we have demonstrated in the Bainbridge, the two-nuclear powerplant system. ~ Admiral Rickover has been working, 1s 1 mentioned before in our- earlier testimony, on a single reactor which would go in a smaller than 8,000-ton ship, but. today it. would not be of the order of any ship that is in our progran.</p>
<p>The Cuatraran. In addition this is the only one in this tonnage: that. would warrant it. : ~ Admiral Jaates. That is right, today.</p>
<p>The Ciaran. I have invited Admiral Rickover. Of course, we all know Admiral Rickover, one of the most distinguished men in the Navy and in the country, and J want to say that this is the first time Admiral Rickover has, in my recollection, appeared before the committee. ‘The reason we have not been asking Admiral Rick- over to come up here is because we have been doing what Admiral Rickover advised the Department to do. He would give the infor- mation to the Department and the Department would give the infor- mation to the committee.</p>
<p>“We didnot want to impose upon Admiral Rickover to invite him up, but we welcome you today. We have followed the guidelines you have set out through the Department. uae</p>
<p>Admiral, I would like to have you make some comments as to the. justification from your viewpoint of substitutions that were made reference to in these frigates, nuclear power for conventional power. _ Admiral Rickover. Thank you, sir. I appreciate very much hav- ing been asked by you to come here. I think the basic issue involved. is cost. and numbers.</p>
<p>The Navy, for reasons Admiral Burke has no doubt adequately explained to you, has requested a minimum of 817 ships. By gomg to nuclear ships, we reduce this number to some extent; not to the extent you may imagine, however. I am talking of surface ships primarily, because there is no longer a question about nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
<p>We are only talking, to 1970, of about 70 to 80 combatant surface ships. The largest difference in total number of these ships, if we</p>
<p>went to nuclear power, would be between 20 to 25 up to 1970. So by</p>
<p>going to combatant nuclear surface ships the number of ships in the</p>
<p>avy will not be reduced from 817, to two-thirds that number. It will be reduced at the most by 20 to 25 ships only, if shipbuilding funds are not increased. .</p>
<p>Thus, we are talking about a relatively small number of ships. Whether we should have 817 ships, I don’t know. If the most impor- tant thing is to have 817, and if nuclear power reduces that number, you can resolve the problem in one of two ways:</p>
<p>You can appropriate more money or you can provide that we have sailing ships. {am sure that with sailing ships we could easily main- tain the number.</p>
<p>The Cramman. Do you mean sailing ships?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. Then you could have 817 or even more. If the primary consideration is numbers, your committee might consider going back to sailing ships.</p>
<p>As for cost, I believe, and the record shows, that nuclear propulsion is one of the cheapest developments Congress has bought, when the advantages that obtain from going to nuclear power are considered.</p>
<p>The ‘cost of a nuclear surface ship, as the Navy has told you, is roughly 114 times as much as a comparable caveritioral ship, amortized over a 20-year life. When we talk of the cost of nuclear ships, we include the cost of the nuclear cores. So instead of the additional cost for a frigate being $35 million, it is only $27 million if you take off the $8 million cost of the nuclear fuel.</p>
<p>But, what do you get for this additional cost? The conventional frigate with which I make comparison, can steam at full power for less than 3,000. miles without refueling.</p>
<p>In practice we cannot go that far at full power because of opera- tional limitations; we will have to stop to refuel because we can’t let a man of war get far out to sea alone with its oil used up because the ship will have to return to port, and it must have fuel reserves at all times to enable it to fight, or meet emergency situations that may arise.</p>
<p>What is the comparison with a nuclear ship? The Bainbridge can go between 150,000 and 180,000 miles continuously at full power with- out refueling as compared with less than 3,000 miles for the conven- tionally powered frigate. Koti</p>
<p>Now, let’s take the situation for 20 knots, which is more represent- ative of speeds at which ships operate much of the time; instead of a distance of about 8,000 miles, the nuclear ship will go 400,000 to 450,000 miles. : -</p>
<p>Now, I ask you, can you conceive of the Air Force coming up here and having to c forced, having to be urged to adopt an airplane which would give 40 to 50 times the cruising radius of existing air lanes? We have the capability for this increased cruising radius right now. There is no question about it. We have been operating a prototype nuclear powerplant at the AIC’s national reactor testing station ; this plant is similar to that in the Bainbridge and has been operating for the last 214 years. eo</p>
<p>During this 24-year period, the plant has been started and stopped 1,400 times. This is what we would normally have in about 15 years of surface-ship operation. We have run that plant a number of hours</p>
<p>57066—61—iNo. 10—~—24</p>
<p>in this 214-year period which corresponds to about 5 years of normal surface-ship operation, So there is no question about what nie sponding shipscoulddo. | |</p>
<p>I would prefer at this point, sir, that you ask questions, |</p>
<p>The Carman. Well, let me ask you this question, Admiral, in reference to the time of construction of a nuclear-type ship and a conventional ship of the same characteristics and the same design, Which one can be constructed earlier? —</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The nuclear ship can be constructed within: the time the conventional one takes. We have so demonstrated, and this is the situation that obtains on the Bainbridge. The same situa- tion obtains on the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Enterprise. Wo have three aircraft carriers under construction, the Hetty Hawk, the Constellation, and the Enterprise.</p>
<p>The Enterprise was authorized 2 years later than the Kitty Hawk and a year Inter than the Constellation, yet all three will be completed at essentially ‘he same time. In comparing the Bainbridge with simi-. lar conventionaily powered ships pee built at the very same yard, you will find that.the nuclear ship will be completed in comparable or in less time than the others. There is no argument that nuclear ships cannot be built as fast or even faster than the others.</p>
<p>We have also demonstrated this with nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. So, therefore, the answer to the question is, you can build a new type ship just as fast as a conventional type.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think I can do it faster, sir.</p>
<p>The Cuarrman. You think you can do it faster?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. What control in construction do you have in con- nection with it? gic</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. I do not have overall control of the ship construction. The contro] I do have is for the nuclear part of the ship. For this part I have my own representative at each yard. He deals with my organization in Washington, and with the naval reactor: Jaboratories. I believe if you asked thé operating people, they will tell you that because of this type of organization they can get quicker answers and faster actions thn through the standard tape</p>
<p>The Cuamman. I judge from the admiral’s testimony that the rea- son why we are not involved in any other type of ship is due to the tonnage, that you do not have a powerplant that has been properly developed that would be usable in a smaller tonnage than the 8,000 tons? Have you anything to say on that?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Yes, sir. 1 would like to start with the frigate type. Whether it is nuclear or conventional makes little difference in _ its deplacement because the size of the ship is determined basically . by its military characteristics.</p>
<p>At one time it was thought the nuclear frigate would be significantly heavier, but this is not the case. For ships smaller than frigates the displacement of a nuclear ship would be greater than that of a con- ventionally powered ship with the same military features. However, with the additional military features being installed in modern shi the displacement and the size is to a greater extent getting to dependent on military characteristics rather than the propulsion plant.</p>
<p>_ ‘To answer your question specifically for the ships we are discussing this morning, there is no essential difference in displacement. For smaller ships there is; the nuclear ship displaces more. .</p>
<p>The CHairman. In the conversion program, as the years go by, is it possible, feasible or really economic to substitute a nuclear power- plant in the conversion program of a ship of the cruiser type, a car- riertype? Isthat possible #</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; it is not practical. This has been con- sidered for the last 10 to 12 years; it is a natural idea. But because of the requirements for shielding and other factors, a completely dif- ferent ship layout is required. The cost would be greater than for a new ship. It is not feasible.</p>
<p>The CHarMan. Then we can understand when we install a nuclear powerplant it must be from the ground.up a new ship ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. Could I ask him a question there?</p>
<p>The CHairMan. Yes.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. Because of the military requirements, the ‘configura- tion of the ship has to be from 8,000 tons up at this time?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. No; it doesn’t have to be, sir. If you were willing to take more modest military features, you could build a nu- clear ship of less than 8,000 tons displacement. It would be larger than the corresponding conventional ship, but still less than 8,000 tons. Today a ship of 8,000 tons or more pays no significant weight penalty for nuclear propulsion.</p>
<p>If the Navy wishes to include all these military features in these ships along with the capability for the increased auxiliary electrical powerload, there is no other practical way to get them, other than by going to nuclear power.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. So you haven’t potten to the place where you can £0 to a destroyer type, but go to the cruiser type. The DLG is really a large destroyer anyway. | — :</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcoxover. It is really a small cruiser.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. So for all intents and purposes, taking into considera- tion the military requirements, you haven’t got below 8,000 tons?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct today. ‘</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. Would you lengthen the ship and do anything about it and then get back to the destroyer class possibly q</p>
<p>Admiral Ricwover. No, sir. As you heard from Admiral James the other day, we are developing a single reactor for a destroyer-type ship which will have the same power as the present two reactors on the Buinbridge.</p>
<p>That will be a very difficult development because it will be the high- est. power reactor that we will have so far developed for naval pro- pulsion.</p>
<p>It will have twice the power of a Bainbridge reactor and more than 11% the capacity of the present largest naval reactor. The advantages will consist in a reduction +n cost and in some reduction in displace- ment and size. Since a major cost of reactor plants is in the fabrica- tion process, obviously one reactor system is several million dollars cheaper than two. :</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. Anything in the class of 8,000 tons—follow me now— not to contain a nuclear reactor, or the twin that you are talking about, is just as much out of date as a crossbow and a sailing ship.</p>
<p>. Admiral Ricxover. Oh, yes. . os = -” Mr, Rivers. Or anything that you construct now, 8,000 and, in ad- dition, it should all be nuclear. . .</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir, Any combatant ship. You wouldn't want to do this necessarily for auxiliary vessels. ;</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. Iam talking about a combatant ship.</p>
<p>’ Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. Absolutely. : a</p>
<p>Last year in the House Appropriations Committee this issue came up for the aircraft carrier, the conventional one which you authorized. At that time the cost difference was estimated to be about $130 mil- lion. At the present time the total difference between nuclear and conventional carriers with the same military characteristics is about $93 million. But, of this $93 million, $30 million is nuclear fuel. _</p>
<p>Mr. Rrvers. That is what I am talking about. You said a while ago in round numbers, 3,000 miles against 400,000.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. For the aircraft carrier it is less than 4,000 miles at full power as compared with 140,000 for the nuclear one.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. But not 20 knots?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricoxover. At 20 knots the figure for the nuclear aircraft carrier is close to 400,000 miles as compared with about 8,000 miles for the conventional one.</p>
<p>The Cxairman. The admiral said all ships from 8,000 tons up fro now on should be nuclear powered.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. We haven’t had the pleasure and the luxury of your testimony. :</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is your own fault, sir. You could have invited me. .</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. From now on, if won’t be our fault. We should have known this thing before. Of course, I hear about you and everybody else hears about you. ,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. You can ask the other naval witnesses here to confirm what I have said, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. We may have you up here in the future.</p>
<p>The point I want to find out—I know it is your first love; I remem- ber when you started, and certainly you are entitled to ‘all kinds of affection and regard and pressure in your country, from your country ———</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Thank you for your gracious words, sir. But look at the many problems that face our country today. Today, in 1961, we must go back and relearn the very same lesson, we learned in</p>
<p>1955 when Congress had to put pressure to the Navy to build more</p>
<p>nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
<p>And here we are, only 6 years later, learning the same lesson all over again. How long can our country afford the price of relearning history every 6 years? :</p>
<p>Mr. Rivers. We need additional POLARIS submarines, don’t we?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. Mr. Rivers. Do you say we ought to authorize some more of those? Admiral Ricxover. I believe what the President has asked for this</p>
<p>year is adequate because it is impracticable to build too many at one —</p>
<p>time. After we get going on these 10, in the 1962 program, there 1s time to consider how many more are needed.</p>
<p>_ The Cuamman. Thank you, Mr. Rivers. Any questions from any other members ¢</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpr. Mr. Chairman,</p>
<p>The Curran. Mr. Van Zandt.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanvr. Mr. Chairman, I find myself confronted with the same problem we were confronted with probably several years ago in the Joint Committee when it'was necessary to call the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations, and I think you were there?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanot. I think Admiral James’ predecessor was also pres- ent, the Chief of the Bureau of Ships.</p>
<p>The Navy came up with a request for eight ships, seven conventional type submarines, and one nuclear. Or it would have been six and two. Six conventional and two nuclear.. | .</p>
<p>We members of the Joint Committee who have lived through this development of the nuclear-powered submarine, as well as surface ships, we felt that in view of the success that we had attained to date from principally the Nautilus, that we could not understand why tho Navy was building conventional submarines.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t they be nuclear powered So, after debating this question—and my colleague from Illinois was present—after debat- ing this question, the Navy went back to the Hill, down on the avenue, and the next day we were informed they had changed their thinking and instead of building eight conventional and two nuclear, they were going to build now, I think, six nuclear and two conventional. So here weare. Weare hack in the same position.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. May I interrupt for a moment, Mr. Van Zandt? The reason for the Navy’s attitude at that time was this: The Nav opposed nuclear submarines because they were afraid they wouldn't get the total number of submarines that they had been getting, I believe they had been getting about one conventional submarine a year. They were afraid if we went to nuclear-powered submarines we might get, say, two every 3 years, and so reduce the total number of sub- marines. Actually it is like any good product you develop; you eventu- ally get more. The thing that has rejuvenated the submarine Navy is</p>
<p>_ huclear power. And I predict, Mr. Vinson, that the decision you make</p>
<p>this morning is a very far-reaching one, because it may be the turning point in changing the Navy over to nuclear. power, changing the sur- face ships. This is long past due. The reason the Navy has not been too avid for nuclear-powerd surface ships is the fear that the increased cost would reduce the number that could be built. °</p>
<p>Mr. VAn Zanvt. Now, Admiral, is it not true we are going all out for POLARIS-type submarines at the neglect of attack-type submarines?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is right, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpr. Do you think we are making a mistake there?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. We definitely are making a mistake. In 1957 we took three nuclear attack submarines then under construc- tion and converted them to the POLARIS type. We never replaced them. Last year, under considerable goading—and I believe mostly from you, Mr. Van Zandt—Congress included four nuclear submarines _ in the naval appropriation measure. The Navy cut it down to one. This year you are being asked to reinstate the remaining three.. I believe we are in a bad way from the standpoint of numbers of nuclear</p>
<p>attack submarines, because it is a most potent weapor :</p>
<p>Russian submarines. So here we are: You yenthanin = ee with your constitutional mandate to support a Navy, vote to doe certain thing, then the executive establishment doesn’t follow throug ih</p>
<p>Were I a member of the committee, I would consider inserting ; proviso in the act that money you appropriate for a specific ship mie not be used for a different ship. Congress, of course, cannot fore the executive branch to build each ship you authorize; this has nad argued time and time again, and Congress, for various reasons, has never seen fit to challenge the executive on that score. But you can provide, if you so desire, that if you appropriate money for a given ship, it not be diverted to another, That you can do. That is within your prerogative,</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanvt. Now, Admiral, let. me continue my questioning In the 1957 budget there were included three attack-type submarines, and the money was shifted over to build POLARIS, ,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpt. And in 1961 certainly they asked for four and we got one.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Congress authorized four, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpr. That is right, but the Navy only funded one, and diverted the money over to three POLARIS.</p>
<p>Now in the fiscal 1962 budget there are three attack-type submarines,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. These are the same three submarines.</p>
<p>_ Mr, Van Zanvr. We have a responsibility then, I see, of protecting those three. And we can argue with the administration. t me go a little further. Is it not true that in the utilization of nuclear power, that you get performances out of a ship that makes it possible to eliminate support facilities ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Oh, yes. I believe if you made a thorough and realistic comparison of the ultimate cost of nuclear versus conven- tional ships you would probably find the nuclear to be cheaper in the long run. This would be even more apparent if the studies were based on wartime operations, rather than’ peacetime conditions,</p>
<p>So far we have talked only about. cost.. We haven’t talked about the great military advantage 2 nuclear-propelled ship has. Yet even on a cost basis I think if you were to take into consideration the num- ber of additional tankers you would require, the steel required for building the tankers, the escort vessels, the facilities, the additional manpower and so on, I believe you actually would save. :</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpr. I believe you will agree that the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy has gone into this area of discussion and we have taken the position that economically, in the end, nuclear power is more economical.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You most certainly have, Mr. Van Zandt. And now, Mr. Chairman, may I add to what I have said?</p>
<p>The Caamman. You can go ahead and say it. :</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpr. Did we not have an illustration of nuclear power recently when we were trying to spot this Portuguese ship in the South ‘Atlantic? We-sent the Seawolf out there. Why? Because she has unlimited cruising capabilities?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Here is a picture of the ship taken through the periscope of the Seawolf.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanpr. We couldn’t have tracked that ship otherwise, could we? -</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If we had enough fueling stations and if our freee surface ships had enough endurance at high speeds, we could</p>
<p>ave done it. The Seawolf is not one of our particularly fast sub- marines. We have other submarines that can make higher speed than the Seawolf.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Zanovr. I was not able to be here when we had the ship construction program discussed. Do I understand it is your feeling we should have two nuclear-powered frigates in the fiscal 1962 pro- gram and four conventional; is that, correct ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. From a political standpoint I would say two. From a technical standpoint I think we should have more, because once you realize we are building obsolete ships then you must ask—as members of this committee, you must ask yourselves whether we should continue to build ships that are not the best obtainable. You may, of course, be limited by budgetary considerations. The Navy has its problems, too. The Navy doesn’t exist merely to have nuclear-powered : ships. It has definite missions; a nuclear-powered ship or any other kind of ship is merely a means to accomplish these ends, But you might consider whether, if the Navy needs more than two nuclear ships, and we no doubt do, whether you shouldn’t do something about providing for additional ones, say three or four this year instead of two. Because once we start along this road of nuclear-powered surface ships, we have really determined our future surface N avy. The de- cision you are making today is a momentous one,</p>
<p>The Cuairman. Mr. Price.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. Admiral, you wouldn’t be under any instruction from the Navy when you testify before a congressional committee, would</p>
<p>J Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I would feel I was being contemptuous - of Congress if I came here to testify as an instructed witness and didn’t tell you so at the very beginning of my testimony. Only once has a superior in the Navy attempted to instruct me. I agreed to say what he wanted me to and asked: “Of course you don’t mind my telling the Committee”—it happened to be the Joint Congressional Committee—*You don’t mind my telling them I am carrying out your instructions?” At which point he said “No, forget it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Price. You pretty much answered the other question I intended to ask you. Why va the Navy at least seem to resist nuclear propul- sion? You covered it part-way but don’t you think mainly it is be-</p>
<p>‘cause of the economics of it?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There is more than one reason, sir. Until half a year ago figures were being bandied about in the Navy Department indicating that nuclear power increased the cost of a ship two times, three times, even four times. I got pretty fed up with this, so I asked Admiral Burke to arrange 4 meeting with his top admirals. This meeting was set up so this subject could be discussed openly and so they could ask me any question they. wished. Very few uestions arose, and I thought I had satisfied them that the cost of nuclear surface ships was one and one half times the cost of a conventionally powered ship having similar military characteristics. Admiral Burke distributed a report of that meeting to the top Navy people and fol-</p>
<p>lowed through by having a detailed stud _made' by the hea Ships Characteristics Board, A report of this stady received a tee top level review in the N avy and has just been released. I am on some of the members of the committee have seen it, Tt discusses toe siderations, advantages, and limitations and confirms that, the cost of nuclear powered surface ships is about one and one-half times that of conventional surface ships having comparable military characteristics I am submitting the document, “Treatise on Nuclear Propulsion in Surface Ships,” for inclusion, with your permission, in the record (The matter referred to is as follows :)</p>
<p>A treatish on nuclear propulsion in surface gsutps</p>
<p>Prepared at the direction of the Chief of Naval Operations by the Chairman Ship Characteristics Board, to provide background information for statements and discussion, April 5, 1961. ’ :</p>
<p>Parr I. INFORMATIVE 1. Introduction</p>
<p>provided the protracted capability for remaining submerged ; and, second, the greatly increased endurance for high sustairied speeds. These led to innoya- tional changes in operational concepts, of which the POLARIS nuclear sub- marine weapon system is one and the potent ASW submarine ig another, b. The protracted endurance for high speed operations potential can be applied to surface ships with even greater emphasis, for their average operational ‘Speeds are greater and consequently generate the need for more frequent re- fueling. The recognition of this potential led to the construction of three nuclear propelled surface ships, one CVA(N), one CG(N), and one DLG(N), to explore ‘the benefits in a variety of combatant ships. The othet aspect of protracted ‘submergence has no currently identifiable parallel for surface ships. :</p>
<p>2. Relative costs</p>
<p>a. When the inclusion of. nuclear propelled surface ships in the shipbuild- ‘ng programs is being considered, the increased cost is the governing factor, The current progress of the nuclear propulsign program, with 13. submarines completed and 30 more authorized or under construction (Jan. 1, 1961) and the 3 surface ships now being built, has provided sufficient information to permit a usable estimate of the relative costs of the 4 principal elements involved, ie., initial construction, personnel requirements, fuel consumption and ‘upkeep, maintenance and overhaul, of similar ships with nuclear and conven- tional power. These have been prepared for a 20-year life of ship and have included estimates for the amortization of the cost of delivering and storing Navy standard fuel oil (NSFO) in the deployed areas. These studies indicate ‘that the current classes of nuclear powered surface ships will cost about 1.5 ‘times, or slightly less, as much as their conventionally powered counterparts. ‘These are dollar comparisons and do not reflect the fact that the endurance -of nuclear powered ships is many times that of the conventionally powered ships. The figure for submarines is of a similar order, but the comparison is less valid since the nuclear submarines have capabilities that the conventional submarines can never attain. The prognosis of developments for reducing these ‘cost ratios is very encouraging. : :</p>
<p>6. These factors are based on estimates,. and sometimes extensive extrapola- tions, which are subject to considerable adjustments as further experience is ‘gained in the submarine program, and later on with the nuclear surface ships</p>
<p>limited due to the newness of nuclear power, and new weapons systems and ‘electronic equipments. However, these ratios. are considered sufficiently valid to be useful planning figures. .</p>
<p>c. The effect upon individual appropriations may vary somewhat from the ‘overall factor of 1.5 for the surface ships. For example, the cost of the first</p>
<p>cores is included in the SCN appropriation, even though this cost was removed from the SGN portion of the computations and applied to the fuel cost to pro- vide a more direct comparison of life of ship fuel consumption ; another is the personnel factor in which an increase of 10 to 25 percent in costs will have oa direct effect on overall personnel allocations ; and, third, the effect on the maintenance funds in the S. &amp; F. appropriation, where an increase of about one-third’ will have a very important impact since the eurrent allocations of funds to maintenance is marginal even for conventional ships. The increases in cost, therefore, will affect shipbuilding appropriations, personnel appropriations and maintenance and operations appropriations.</p>
<p>3. Weight, space, and endurance</p>
<p>a. Nuclear propulsion plants for surface ships have been heavier and have required greater volume than the conventional plants they have replaced, neg- lecting the ship’s endurance fuel. The inclusion of the ship’s design endurance fuel makes these installations more comparable from the weight and volume basis; however, there still exists the difference of endurance. The nuclear- propelled ships currently have many times the endurance of their conventionally powered counterparts ; longer life cores will increase this factor with resultant reductions in costs, and no changes to weight and volume.</p>
<p>b. The concentrated weights and larger machinery spaces for: the nuclear pro- pulsion plants have dictated different ship arrangements and have required new considerations in ship design. Utilization of the available reactor designs placed some restrictions on the shaft horsepower of the three prototype nuclear surface ships. Matching the endurance characteristics of the reactor plants with reliable steamplant components also has caused increases in weight, space, and cost. The net result is the three prototype surface ships have a maximum speed capa- bility somewhat less than their conventional counterparts. The maximum sus- stained speeds are substantially similar.</p>
<p>c. The comparison of weights of machinery plants of conventional ships must include the fuel oil; and the amount in any ship design is a matter for decision that is determined by a suitable combination of operational performance, mili- tary characteristics, and costs.</p>
<p>d. The combined requirements of suitable weapons systems and electronic equipments with nuclear propulsion result in the larger DLG-16 type, being the minimum size ship in which a suitable two-reactor nuclear plant can be installed within the current state of nuclear technology. The use of the single reactor plant with the same power, now under development, will reduce the cost and weight of the nuclear propulsion plant and the ships of this class. The studies of the application of nuclear power to smaller ships has generally shown that very large proportional increases in costs, size, and displacements are required to maintain a balance in the combination.</p>
<p>_e. The personnel requirements in nuclear propulsion plants at the present time are somewhat greater in numbers and require additional accommodations in ships.</p>
<p>4. Developments</p>
<p>a. The progress in development of nuclear reactor cores is highly encouraging for the future. The core life has increased several fold from the first. Nautilus core, and the ABC has indicated that they are working on longer life cores. Further. the costs of these cores are decreasing at the same time core life is being extended.</p>
<p>b. The Atomic Energy Commission has undertaken developments to design</p>
<p>-a single nuclear reactor plant of much higher horsepower than is current avail-</p>
<p>able from any single naval propulsion reactor plant. This development. will help reduce the cost of nuclear surface ships as a result of requiring a lesser number of reactors; and some reduction in the weight and size of the nuclear surface ships will result.</p>
<p>5. Provisions and supplies</p>
<p>a. The endurance of ships also involves their capacities for fond, snare narts and consumable stores, and the requirement for these is exnected to remain the. same for either tyne of propulsion system. These categories of renlenishment should, in practically all kinds of emplovment. be made sufficiently freavent to maintain the shins in an adequate degree of rendiness. The reanirements for ammunition and aviation fuel are similar, hut the frequency of renlenish- ment is dependent upon the nature of the operational employment and cannot be as readily predicted.</p>
<p>6. Benefits to different types of ships * The application to nuclear propulsion has potential advantages which can- not be fully predicted until operational experience has been gained from a num. ber of these ships. The following is a brief evaluation of some considerations regarding the application of nuclear power in frigates, cruisers, and carriers -</p>
<p>a. Destroyers and frigates.—(1) These types now have the shortest endurance of the combat-ship types. The latter classes with longer endurance’ haye in- creased considerably in size and cost to provide greater space and Weight for larger weapons installations and additional fuel oil.</p>
<p>(2) The destroyer and frigate types require more frequent refueling since their steaming distances are usually greater than the larger ships. They do not usually require as frequent replenishment of ammunition and aviation fue] so that the NSFO requirement remains the limiting consideration under prac. tically all conditions.</p>
<p>(3) The requirements of the planned new equipments, such as sonars and radars, for greater amounts of electrical power will all require increased amounts of fuel to maintain their current endurance. “</p>
<p>(4) These several considerations indicate that the frigate class of destroyers will derive the greater benefit from nuclear propulsion. ;</p>
<p>b. Cruisers—(1) Cruisers already have moderate endurance, but historically cruisers have roamed over larger areas than the main task forces and are also available for independent operations so that long endurance would be an iden- tifiable asset. The comments on impending new radar electrical power require- ments in 6.a(3), above. are also applicable to cruisers.</p>
<p>c. Carriers —(1)The CVA’s have the greatest amount of endurance and fuel, and if they are released from the need to fuel escorting ships, their endurance would be increased. In the combat arens during sustained air strike opera- tions. the critical requirements are aviation fuel and ammunition, rather than fuel oil.</p>
<p>(2) Nuclear propulsion does not of itself offer the same degree of improve- ment of capabilities in CVA, although the larger CVA(N) carries slightly more aviation fuel. However, nuclear propulsion would increase the average speeds in oversea movements when weather and sea conditions could become the limit- ing factors; and if the requirement for CVA to refuel escorts were eliminated, the amount of aviation fuel could be increased which would result in longer porous of sustained air operations between ship and aviation fuel replen- shment.</p>
<p>7. Construction and overhaul facilities</p>
<p>, @, There are now two Naval shipyards ( Portsmouth, N.H., and Mare Island) and five commercial yards (Flectric Boat. New York Shipbuilding, Newport News Shipbuilding, Ingalls and Bethlehem-Quincy). that have facilities for con- structing and overhauling nuclear-powered ships. Three additional Naval Ship- yards (Norfolk, Charleston, and Pearl Harbor) are now scheduled to receive the facilities required for the overhaul of nuclear-powered ships.</p>
<p>b. When the nuclear surface fleet is expanded, additional facilities for con- struction and overhaul may he required beyond those now existing and planned; and may invoive tenders for afloat support capabilities, .</p>
<p>.¢. Nuclear-powered surface ships are designed to at least the same criteria for sustaining damage to the machinery spaces as conventional ships, and the reactors are located in the most protected areas of the ship. Repair of storm or ‘collision damage would normally not be significantly more difficult than for similar damage on conventional ships. ‘These nuclear-powered ships have those features required for safety included in their design to provide, to the maxi- mum practicable extent, for all foreseeable contingencies which could arise from storm, collision, or battle damage.</p>
<p>Part II. Favorarte Aspects or NUCLEAR PROPULSION IN SURFACE SHIPS</p>
<p>1. Virtually unlimited high-power endurance with the following advantages:</p>
<p>a. Elimination of the time required and the operational limitations imposed by the refueling requirement for surface ship propulsion fuel.</p>
<p>b. Elimination of need for protecting combatant and replenishment sbips during refueling and of the oilers proceeding to refueling rendezvous.</p>
<p>c. Elimination of replenishment oilers for that portion of the fleet having nuclear power. ,</p>
<p>d. Higher average speeds during transits to the area of operations,</p>
<p>2. The nonnuclear portions of the steam machinery plant, such as the tur- bines and their auxiliaries, are generally of simpler design since the require- ment for high thermal efficiency is not as controlling as it is for conventional plants. Some of the nonpropulsion auxiliaries are also of simpler design. This can be expected to provide greater reliability and easier maintenance.</p>
<p>3. The immense reservoir of endurance in the nuclear reactor may have distinctly favorable potential for large ancillary power requirements in a ship, such as steam for catapults, and the very high electrical loads of new radars and sonars, .</p>
<p>4. A stockpile of reactor cores could be created in the strategic materials program. These stockpiles of reactor cores are not a radiation hazard; they require relatively small storage areas, and new individual cores are readily transportable to locations suitable for installation.</p>
<p>5. There is a greater probability of orders of magnitude improvement in the new field of nuclear power than in an older source, such as fuel oil, that has been subjected to generations of developments, refinements, and improvements. The decreasing costs of nuclear cores is one significant example which could have even greater significance if the cost of fuel oil continues to increase.</p>
<p>6. Stack gases are eliminated with nuclear propulsion. This eliminates the corrosive effect of these gases on radar antennas and aircraft and the hazard to landing operations caused by flying through turbulent path of the exhaust gases. Elimination of stacks eases topside arrangements.</p>
<p>7. Nuclear power provides the potential for surface ship operation independ- ent of the atmosphere for ABC defense.</p>
<p>Part III. Limirine Asrecrs</p>
<p>1. The increased cost factor of about 1.5 times the conventional counterparts, which has the following effects :</p>
<p>a. The total numbers of ships procurable within any given monetary level are reduced on a 2 by 8 ratio, which, if applied to the larger numbers in a type of ships, would mean, for example, 10 for 15. The other viewpoint is to increase that portion of the SCN appropriation for nuclear propelled ships by a factor of about 1.5, which would affect other programs in a level funding climate.</p>
<p>». Increases the annual funds required in operations and maintenance appro- priations (S. &amp; F.), which are already marginal. This increase will either re- duce the amounts for other ships or require an increased portion of the annual appropriation. ‘</p>
<p>c. Increases both the numbers of personnel required and the amount of train- ing involved and consequently the costs for pay, allowances, and training. The - types of personnel involved are of premium quality, which further increases the Navy’s requirement for this category of personnel. eh</p>
<p>. d. Increases the costs involved for research and development in the nuclear propulsion field. , ‘</p>
<p>2. The nuclear propulsion plants as installed in the three prototype surface ships, while significantly increasing the endurance, have had the following effects:</p>
<p>a. Increases somewhat the size of the ship for the nuclear propulsion plant, when compared with conventional surface ships having normal endurance with otherwise similar characteristics; and for the accommodations for the increased numbers of personnel.</p>
<p>6. Reduces somewhat the top speeds, although the maximum sustained speeds are substantially similar, within the conventional ships’ lesser endurance.</p>
<p>c. The DLG-16, with suitable weapons systems and electronics equipment, is about the minimum size ship in which a suitable two-reactor nuclear plant can be installed in the present state of the technology. The application of nuclear power to smaller ships such as DE/DNG or DDG would involve disproportionate increases in costs and size to maintain a balance in the combination of military characteristics.</p>
<p>3. The requirements for construction and maintenance facilities ashore and afloat, and repairs to damages were noted in paragraphs 7 and 8 of part I.</p>
<p>Part IV. Consiperations</p>
<p>1. The requirements for the total number of ships in the Navy are based upon the responsibilities for multiocean operations in the national interests. The determination of the numbers of ships within the various types, carriers, cruisers,</p>
<p>destroyers, amphibious, submarines, etc., is based upon their several fun</p>
<p>military capabilities. These include detection systems, such as tedate aol sonars; the destructive capabilities of the weapons systems installed; the com-</p>
<p>mand and control facilities, such as communications, computers and wea direction systems; transportation capabilities for amphibious and underway ve plenishment ships; ability to influence opinion, or the deterrent capabllity. When provided with adequate refueling facilities, the conventionally powered surface ships of the Navy have gone where needed to carry out this multiocean responsibility. :</p>
<p>2. There have been important degrees of improvement in weapons ‘systems radars, sonars, etc., that have increased their costs, but these improvements have extended the ranges of detection or weapons or permitted the Navy to accomplish something that could not previously be done; and, when the increased capabilities of the opposition are considered, these improvements do not reduce the require- ments for the numbers of ships. :</p>
<p>3. Similarly, nuclear propulsion is an important degree of improvement, and like most improvements will have an added cost, which will improve surface ship capabilities in those performance aspects affected by propulsion methods and refueling requirements. However, the improvement in propulsion and endurance aspects does not, in itself, permit the Navy to reduce the numbers of combatant ships required to meet its responsibilities.</p>
<p>4. The very long endurance of nuclear propulsion eliminates the need for re- fueling, and this begets many advantages in operational flexibility. The greatest application will probably be in that portion, of the wide variety of ship employ- ments, involving oversea movements and the independent operations of one ship or a small group of ships. The independent operations can be conducted in those areas on the seas where the usual replenishment forces are available only infre- quently, for food and supplies; or for extended transits of individual ships for specialized purposes, such as intercept or search and rescue or influence missions wherein a single ship, or a small group of ships, will be sufficient. The overseas movements of forces with nuclear propulsion could be made at higher average speeds and the weather micht well become the limiting factor. This ability to move some forces rapidly lis a highly useful military potential in those situa- tions where long movements may be involved and an early show of force by a se- lected number of ships may have distinct advantages.</p>
<p>_ §..The Navy intends to enlarge its future nuclear surface ship program in a manner that is consistent with its other requirements. The Secretary of Defense has expressed support for the Navy’s intention to work toward a nuclear- powered Navy. The number of nuclear-powered surface ships that can be built under the present conditions of cost will be mederate. When the developments have progressed further so that these factors are reduced, the rate can be accel- erated, for the potential advantages of nuclear propulsion are well recognized.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Now why was the Navy against nuclear power?</p>
<p>The Navy was concerned that nuclear power would probably re- duce the total number of ships. :</p>
<p>Missiles, radar, sonar, all sorts of military items cost five, six, and more times as much today as in 1945. Yet these higher cost items are being included in our ships.</p>
<p>We are in danger today of losing ourselves in a congestion of scientific and engineering information. But our difficulty is, there are not enough people in the services who understand modern tech- nology to make wise decisions as to which of these expensive items to develop and to use. Too frequently when a salesman or indus-</p>
<p>trialist comes in with his brandnew idea, everybody jumps on the</p>
<p>bandwagon; frequently they mistake a dream for reality. And this is one of the reasons why so many of these ideas, which are very eX- pensive to carry through, are not bearing fruit in time.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to explain this reluctance to grasp nuclear power. It is probably a combination of not desiring to reduce the number of ships, plus the fact that the money appropriated must be used for</p>
<p>many other purposes. But we must remember that. when we resist. -</p>
<p>improvements as innovations, we may soon have to accept innova- tions as improvements.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. I would like to get down to the case regarding the frigate. Unfortunately, in these type meetings you don’t have the transcript. available too readily, and we have only a limited number, and I didn’t know you were going to be here this morning, so 1 didn’t go over the transcript. But my impression during the ques- tions 1 asked with regard to the reason they had only one nuclear- powered frigate and six conventional—at least I was left with the im- pression that it approached only a certain part in your work on a pro- pulsion plant suitable to a frigate, and it was not a wise thing to go ahead with the second one until you produced a better plant to meet the particular needs of this type of ship.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You may have gotten that impression, sir, but actually there will be no other nuclear plant for the next 2 or 3 years, so all you are doing by waiting is depriving the United States of superior military ships. We are developing a new reactor plant. We don’t know exactly how fast we can complete this development, but we do know that the ships we are addressing ourselves to this morn- ing, namely, frigates with two reactors, are viable and superior, and should therefore be built without delay. To do otherwise is tanta- mount to taking out life insurance in a second-best company.</p>
<p>Mr. Pricz. Do you think you are sufficiently far advanced now, with adequate nuclear powerplants, to make it advisable for the N avy to accept two nuclear-powered frigates. at the sacrifice of three con- ventional ones?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Mr. Price, you are getting me out of my water. It is not my province to tell you how many ships the Navy should have. That is not my‘job. I can only tell you this—talking for my- self, I surely would rather have two nuclear than three conventional ships, any time.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. This is a little different point, though, Admiral. At least I was left with the impression after my questioning at this</p>
<p>oint, that we might be taking a risk if we did go to two nuclear</p>
<p>igates at the sacrifice of three conventional because of certain conditions.</p>
<p>I wonder if you would mind reviewing that particular segment of our transcript whenever it is available to you, to reflect on the colloquy at that time, and at least inform me later on as to what you think about this.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Mr. Price, I suggest, since the people who testified on that point are here, you ask them. I wasn’t the one who made the statement.</p>
<p>Mr. ‘Pricg. I mean only for information.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. I will be glad to do that.</p>
<p>Mr. Price. I am not questioning it. Admiral J: ames, were you the one——</p>
<p>Admiral James. This is a culmination of the conversation between Admiral Beakley, myself, and you, sir. There is no nuclear ship in the budget as presented. You spoke of one in there. There are seven conventional DLG’s that have been requested. This is the discussion of the intent to substitute two nuclear DLG’s for three conventional rather than add one.</p>
<p>er EE</p>
<p>Mr. Price. We have one frigate that is nuclear-propelled ?</p>
<p>Admiral James. No, sir, that is building. The Bainbridge today is under construction and will be delivered next year.</p>
<p>Mr. Price, That is what Lam thinking of. My question at the time was directed to the point that if we did have a nuclear propulsion plant. suitable to the frigate, why didn’t we go ahead, and you gave some reasoning</p>
<p>Admiral James. No, sir, I think Admiral Beakley told you that this matter had been put into the Navy’s budget at the initial con- sideration of the budget, but had been stricken out in the interests of producing the maximum number of ships and of cost—the economic factor.</p>
<p>We have Admiral Ramage here, representing Admiral Beakley in CNO.</p>
<p>The Craman. I think you will help the operations of the commit- tee if you will bear in mind that all vessels over 8,000 tons may well have nuclear propulsion in the future, and he hopes within 3 years to have some tonnage less than that. I think that is the issue, and I think he is on sound ground, and I hope we can go ahead and reflect that in the report that all future surface ship canstruction for com- batant. vessels should contemplate the inclusion of nuclear propulsion plants. I hope the Admiral and his scientists will oar be able to develop a reactor, that will meet the requirements of ships of less than 8,000 tons. i</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Bates, have you anything to say ?</p>
<p>Mr. Bares. I was of the opinion the Navy recommended these two nuclear frigates and they were stricken out later on. Is that correct? pore Ramacn. I am Admiral Ramage, representing Admiral</p>
<p>eakley. ue</p>
<p>Our 1962 budget which went forward to the Secretary of Defense— in one budget we had seven DLG’s and one DLGN.</p>
<p>In another budget which was a preferred budget reflecting our requirements there were eight DLG’s and two DLGN’s.</p>
<p>During the course of review by the Office, Secretar of Defense, that budget was reduced to seven DIA3’s, and the two DLGN’s were stricken out. wl</p>
<p>In replying to the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Committee, the Secretary of Defense in his letter of December 5, 1960, wrote:</p>
<p>The Department of Defense; however, does not see its way to approving inelu-</p>
<p>sion of a nuclear-powered frigate in the 1962 Navy budget as proposed by the Navy. I would expect, however, that this construction would be included in the</p>
<p>° 1963 budget.</p>
<p>Now, in our long-range objectives, Mr. Chairman, we have included 2, DLGN’s per year henceforth, projecting on to a total from the pres- ent time, in the program which we have given you, &amp; total of 42 DLG’s, of which 30 percent would be nuclear powered, on the basis that from 1963 on they would all be nuclear powered.</p>
<p>Mr. Bares. Mr. Chairman, on that point I asked a question the other day, why not have nuclear frigates now, and Admiral Beakley indi- cated that Admiral Rickover was working on a single reactor that would be available next year.</p>
<p>Now we find out that it won’t be available next year, and maybe not even the year after, or the year after that.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct.</p>
<p>———=_</p>
<p>Mr. Bares. Now you indicate that next year we will have a sus- tained program of two a year. Well, if we are going to get in this business, and we have all the technology present today, if that is going to be the future Navy, why not get on with the job? What are we pri for? If it is good next year and the year after and the year atter.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We can’t cut our costs either, unless we build these ships now. I have some figures that show the reductions we have made in nuclear core costs. I would like to put them in the record.</p>
<p>(The matter referred to is as follows :)</p>
<p>The following table shows the approximate reduction in cost and increase in life between the first nuclear cores of a given type and those bought last year:</p>
<p>a ‘ Decrease in cost | Increase in life ree ee</p>
<p>Percent Percent Nautilus-type core... 222-220-2222 eeee eee ene e eee 20 100 Skate-type core__...- 2-22.22 22 2t tote none eens e seen 40 20 Skipjack-type core... 22.222 22 eae n eee eee 60 20</p>
<p>The decrease in cost. of the Nautilus-type core has been 20 percent, yet the core life has increased 100 percent. For the Skate-type submarine the decrease in cost is 40 percent, and the core life increased</p>
<p>@ 20 percent. For the Skipjack-type submarine the cost decrease has been 60 percent, the life increase 20 percent.</p>
<p>I recently received bids for repeat surface-ship nuclear cores. The initial core cost was about $714 million. Due to improved design and development we will be getting replacement cores for about one-third this initial cost. Furthermore, on the Bainbridge I turned back $5 million because the actual cost of the nuclear plant was that much less than I had originally estimated. And even ie the price for prac- tically all military items is going up, nuclear plant costs have come | down.</p>
<p>But we can’t have such reductions unless we build some ships and let industry and shipyards gain experience. We are not going to get costs down just by doing paper work and always talking about it, and always putting it off until next year. This has been true of our nuclear submarines, too. The costs of the nuclear plants have come down to about half what they were originally.</p>
<p>For the Skipjack the nuclear plant cost was about $18 million. We are buying niaaristine nuclear plants now for about $9 million. But there is only one way to bring the cost down—to build some.</p>
<p>. The Cuamman. That will put you back in the ship business, That is the reason for this hearing this morning. | _ Mr. Bares. The Navy recommended these two. What, then, is the present position of the Secretary of the Navy ?</p>
<p>* Admiral Rickover. The Secrtary of the Navy, ina discussion I had with him this morning, authorized me to say to this committee he had no—I am using his very words—he had no objection to having two</p>
<p>_nuclear frigates in the fiscal year 1962 pr program, Y Mr. Strarron. I apologize for not having been here for the earlier part of your presentation, and perhaps you mentioned this, but I would like to clarify it. It was my recollection when this question was</p>
<p>raised the other day and Admiral James was testifying, and Admiral Benkley, that the critical point that was made was that the nuclear reactor presently developed wouldn’t push a destroyer fast. enough to meet the requirements of the Navy. Now perhaps you have already responded to it. If you haven’t, I would like to know what your answer to that is, Admiral.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. My answer is this: The nuclear surface ship will generally make about. one knot less than its conventional counter- part, but for maximum sustained speed there is no difference. The maximum sustained speed is that speed a surface ship makes when using 80 percent of its horsepower. Actually, our nuclear ships operate many times as much at high powers as do conventional ships. The usual conventional ship runs at powers of 75 percent to 80 percent, for only a small percentage of its life. The nuclear ships are running about 50 percent of their operating time at high powers.</p>
<p>The extra knot is like having an automobile that could make a little bit more speed for a short spurt but for actually getting to a destina- tion there is no essential difference in time.</p>
<p>Mr. Srratton. The pomt Mr. Bates referred to a moment ago, there was some discussion you were working on a new type of reactor which would be able to deliver the additional speed.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricwover. The nuclear reactor you refer to will develo about the same power as the two in the Banbridge type frigate. It is quite a significant advance, when you think of it to develop one reactor which will, in about the same volume, deliver twice as much power. That is a significant development. This single reactor will not give the ship greater speed than the present two. With the greatly increased requirements for electric, power imposed by new radar, sonar, communications and fire control equipment, and so on, a considerable additional amount of conventional fuel would have: to be carried if we don’t go to nuclear power. Otherwise the ship’s speed or cruising radius or both will have to be reduced.</p>
<p>Mr. Osmers. While the Admiral is here, Mr. Chairman, I wonder if he would care to give us any views at all on what the nation should do in the nuclear-powered plane field.</p>
<p>The Cratrman. I am going to set that up at a special hearing, because we are pushed for time this morning, and the Air Force is here and I do not want to—perhaps I invited the Admiral up without going into this, and I am satisfied the committee is going to reach a</p>
<p>roper decision with reference to these and will lay down a program or the future. I think the testimony he has delivered to us this morning will give us a sound ground to write a policy statement in the report for future construction to be of nuclear power and these ~ two will be of nuclear power, and I am satisfied he will bring about reduced costs every year when he gets into the program.</p>
<p>_I want to have the missiles presented by the Air Force as early as possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. The frigate which you have mentioned has two reactors, {3 that correct.?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. You will not be able to have a single reactor within 2 or 8 or more years; is that correct ? aie</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir; you must remember it is a difficult development. So when I mention a time limit I must advise you it is oply.an estimate. It is the best I can say today but it is still anestimate. It may take longer.</p>
<p>Mr. Bray., If:you wait to authorize the frigate until we get a single reactor, we will not be in the field next year, or the year after.</p>
<p>‘Admiral. Ricxover.. We are. already condemned to have but one nuclear-powered. frigate up to 1965, even if you authorize nuclear powered frigates in the fiscal year 1962 program. ;</p>
<p>Mr. Bray. If we are going to get, into the nuclear-powered frigate, it must be done—if we want to get it in the next-3 or 4 or more years, ° it must bedone—you can’t do it any earlier than now.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There is only one way you can do it, sir, and that is immediately to start building duplicates of the Bainbridge nuclear propulsion plant. To obtain these repeat. Bainbridge type nuclear frigates at. minimum cost we should make the absolute mini- mum. number of changes in their design and we should require bids on a competitive basis from qualified shipbuilders. We should: not assign these ships on a cost-plus fixed-fee basis to any yard; that would be the certain way to increase the cost.</p>
<p>Mr. Wirson. Well, I would like to clarify what you mean by this 1% timescost. Is that first cost ? :</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. Yes. It also happens to be about 114 for the cost amortized over a 20-year period.</p>
<p>Mr. Witson. What actually is the difference, for going out with 430 we and buying a nuclear-powered frigate, versus a conventional</p>
<p>rigate ?</p>
<p>Kamiral Ricxover. If you don’t count nuclear fuel, there is about $27 million difference in construction cost. Tf you include the nuclear fuel it is $35 million. Conventional ships do not include the fuel cost for several years of operation in their construction cost; nuclear ships do. ‘This is the reason for the $35 million rather than the $27 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Wuson. What is that percentagewise? Twice as much ?</p>
<p>Admiral James. It is about 50 percent more.</p>
<p>Mr. Wuson. Actually, then, if you consider the auxiliary vessels needed, fuel, and so forth, needed over a long period of time, it is probably cheaper in the Jong run to run a nuclear frigate than it is a conventional frigate?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rrcxover. You had better ask me that, question, sir, be- cause it might embarrass the other witnesses, and it doesn’t embar- rass me.</p>
<p>Mr. Wuson. Tam asking you.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. It 1s probably cheaper, if all aspects of the cost, to the Navy and to others, are taken into account. This ques- tion has been raised a number of times by Mr. Mahon and members of his Appropriations Subcommittee. Many intangibles are involved. What are we going to do in a modern war if an area of ovr coun- try is destroyed and refueling facilities are knocked out? A. nuclear ship can remain at sea without refueling months at a tie, the conventional one can’t.</p>
<p>Mr. Wuson. All vessels over 8,000 should be nuclear-powered. You mean all combatant ?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; combatant.</p>
<p>57066—61—No. 10——25</p>
<p>Sex</p>
<p>.. The Cuarrman. Mr. Arends. ait 4</p>
<p>‘Mr.. Arenns. Is it the budget, the Appropriations Committee. where is the problem? | ii, ,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think one stumbling block is that’ members of this committee may have beconie inured over ‘a period of years to getting all their information from one source. Nothing prohibits you from going to any other source you may desire to obtain informa- tion. |</p>
<p>Mr. Arenns. Meaning what?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. You generally go only to Naval Operations,</p>
<p>Mr. Arenps. Let me say this, they have done pretty good in the</p>
<p>ast. They have possibly not done as good as you like, but they have done pretty good in the past. &lt;</p>
<p>The Crataan. Admiral Rickover and Admiral James, and all of you, I want to thank you. I think you have give us something to allow us to reach a firm decision with reference to these frigates being nuclear-powered.</p>
<p>Later on, Admiral Rickover, in response to questions from Mr. Osmers, I am going to invite you back here to discuss in more detail nuclear power, and I would like for you to get into position, if you can, to advise us with reference to nuclear-driven airplanes.</p>
<p>We have to thank all of you and excuse you now, and I will call the Air Force.</p>
<p>Thank you. :</p>
<p>(Whereupon the committee proceeded to further business.)</p>
