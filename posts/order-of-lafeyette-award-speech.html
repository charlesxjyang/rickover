      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1962 acceptance speech for The Order of Lafayette Freedom Award, Vice Admiral H.G. Rickover emphasizes that the success of the nuclear fleet is a collective achievement, attributing it to &quot;all the men and women who have contributed,&quot; including specific individuals like Congressman Chet Holifield, Glenn T. Seaborg, Fred Korth, and Admiral Anderson. Rickover highlights the symbolic connection between the historical French aid to the American colonies, embodied by Lafayette, and the modern nuclear Navy&#x27;s crucial role in preserving peace and freedom through deterrence, particularly via missile-launching submarines. He reinforces this bond by noting that one Polaris submarine is named the LAFAYETTE and by crediting France&#x27;s foundational contributions to modern engineering and science, ultimately underscoring the need for continued spiritual, intellectual, and historical unity among Western nations to face future challenges.</p>

        <p>Remarks by vice admiral h. G. Rickover, USN on acceptance of the order of lafayette freedom award |. Monday - 3 december, 1962</p>
<p>Our nuclear fleet represents the combined efforts of many individuals and many organizations. No one organization and no one man is responsible for what, has been accomplished. Those who have worked so hard and with such personal sacrifice to design, build and operate these ships and train their crews can never be given full recognition.</p>
<p>It is to them and to their understanding families that tribute should be paid. Our nuclear Navy is their offspring. Whatever credit there may pe belongs to them. |</p>
<p>Nor could the work have been accomplished without the constant support of Congressman Chet Holifield, Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy arid all members of his Committee, as well as Chairman Glenn T. Seaborg and the members of the Atomic Energy Commission. Also our Secretary of the Navy, Fred Korth and our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Anderson.</p>
<p>So, in accepting this award I do it in the name of all the men and women who have contributed.</p>
<p>The Order of Lafayette meets tonight in memory of a man who means a great deal to us, for he symbolizes the help given the thirteen beleaguered colonies by his great country.</p>
<p>Perhaps our nuclear Navy will some day be of similar help to all of us who belong to the Atlantic Civilization--a civilization that is at bay against those who would destroy our way of life, even at the risk of war, could they put be sure of winning at the first stroke. Our missile launching submarines may render aggression sufficiently risky to preserve peace and</p>
<p>permit us to continue living in freedom.</p>
<p>ae alliance of France with the American colonies was more than a cary or political compact. We had built here in an empty wilderness a gernment that incorporated much of what French thinkers of the Age of Pa ae had postulated for an ideal State; there were thus bonds between us superior to mere political expedience. So, too, today: The nations of the West represent an alliance, not merely of military contingents; they are also a union of states subscribing to the same basic principles of domestic and international conduct.</p>
<p>It was only fitting that one of our Polaris submarines has been named “the LAFAYETTE. That ship is a complex weapon; she is also something more. Her ineus tn a symbol of the bonds that join our country to France -- spiritually, intellectually, historically. All of us of the West need to nurture. these bonds, to aspire to a sense of unity not unlike that which animated medieval Europe and sustained her for a thousand years against the onslaught of aggression from the East.</p>
<p>our nuclear Navy represents high levels of engineering; here too is a bond that unites us to France and to other Western nations where the bases were laid for modern science and engineering. France, as we all know, founded the first great modern engineering school, predecessor of our own institutes of technology that came much later. Nuclear power itself rests | upon work done by the Curies.</p>
<p>Thus, in many ways the name Lafayette symbolizes that we of the West are all citizens in a world of knowledge; that we must continue to stimulate one another spiritually and intellectually. Pursuit of truth through sclentific search 18° the invention of Western civilization; to join our. strengths together will create a unity powerful enough to meet any challenge</p>
<p>from whatever source it may emerge.</p>
