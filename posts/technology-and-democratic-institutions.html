      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s 1963 speech, &quot;Technology and Democratic Institutions,&quot; delves into the critical challenge of reconciling rapid technological advancement with the preservation of human values and democratic principles. Rickover asserts that while technology is inherently neutral, its application&#x27;s impact—positive or negative—rests solely on human choices, warning against &quot;authoritarian technologies,&quot; bureaucracy, and the &quot;superhuman scale of organizations&quot; that can erode individual autonomy and civic engagement. He critiques the idea that technology renders ethical concepts obsolete, citing figures like Rachel Carson (on ecological sin from pesticides), John Kenneth Galbraith (on consumer debt), and historic references like the Declaration of Independence and Woodrow Wilson. Rickover highlights the dangers of over-reliance on experts, which can undermine democratic control, and calls for strengthening local governance, fostering active citizenship, and adopting a balanced &quot;crisis of intelligence&quot; approach—combining practical and scholarly insights—to ensure technology serves human happiness rather than imperiling it, a concern he shared with President Eisenhower regarding the &quot;military-industrial complex.&quot;</p>

<p>TECHNOLOGY AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Remarks by Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, USN<br>, at the —</p>
<p>Tenth Anniversary Convocation of the<br>Center for the 8tudy of Democratic Institutions,<br>The Fund for the Republic, Inc.<br>Americana Hotel, New York, New York<br>January 21, 1963</p>
<p>I regret I must confine my comment to Mr. Mumford&#x27;s address.<br>Mp. Piel&#x27;s paper reached me only last week, at a time when the pressure<br>of my regular work was exceptionally heavy. I could not manage to read<br>it with sufficient care to formulate an opinion on the many interesting</p>
<p>points he has made.</p>
<p>Mr. Mumford offers us a fruitful avenue of approach to the topic</p>
<p>d bngex discussion. By emphasizing the human values democracy seeks to<br>i protect and nourish, and by showing how gravely these are threatened in<br>| “authoritarian technologies,&quot; he establishes the primacy of democratic<br>| institutions over technology. This needs to be set forth clearly, for<br>4 there is a considerable body of opinion propagating what comes dangerously<br>ty close to being an opposite view.<br>wl We must clearly distinguish two basic facts about technology. First,<br>that while it enables us to increase our power of mind and body, it does<br>ot</p>

<p>fe dictate how we use this power. In this sense technology is neutral.<br>@e remain the controller of our actions and we are responsible for their<br>consequences. I. am unconvinced when people tell me that rapid scientific<br>progress, which changes fundamentally che ways we provide for our material<br>wants, thereby obsoletes the fundamental ethical and moral concepts</p>
<p>Western man has painfully evolved over the centuries. -Why ever should</p>
<p>machine-produced affluence invalidate the Ten Commandments or the Sermon</p>
<p>on the. Mount? _ What has “4Amproved health to do with that great Western<br>concept of the supreme moral worth of the individual which flows from<br>pelief in the fatherhood of God and the protherhood of man=-the concep ©<br>that is the foundation of our own and every other democracy in the world?<br>| As machines relieve us of the: brytal, | tiring; and: time-consuming ‘Labor<br>that had been the lot of the majority of men from time immemorial ; as they<br>enable us to universalize affluence and leisure, we face a choice: We<br>may take these benefits and live the life of the idle rich of old,<br>pursuing a good time and not bothering about the quality of our own life<br>or the life of the nation. Or, we may decide to emulate those--and there<br>were many--who in the past ‘considered wealth and leisure a trust, to be<br>utilized for self- improvement and for improvement of their particular</p>
<p>societies. The cholce is for each individual to make. Moreover , each</p>
<p>individual, under our form of government , has a right to speak out publicl</p>
<p>in ‘favor of making better use of science and technology than is possible<br>under present conditions.</p>
<p>‘If those who agree with this new viewpoint become a majority; in</p>
<p>other words, 4f a consensus is reached through public discussion of this</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>4sue, the American people may decide to take action. The action may<br>‘displease powerful vested interests, but this is how we govern ourselves.<br>The status quo has no absolute sanctity under our form of government. It<br>must constantly justify 4tself to the people in whom is vested ultimate<br>sovereignty over this nation. |<br>We have gotten into the deplorable habit of regarding all who think<br>and speak about ways to improve our way of life as persons nogtile to<br>American democracy, or lacking in love of country, or at: east as being<br>disagreeably &quot;controversial&quot; cunmudgeons . Let us ponder the following<br>words taken from the Declaration of Independence: . &quot;it is the Right of<br>the People to alter or to abolish it:/their. governnent7 3” ‘and to institute<br>new Government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing<br>its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect |<br>their Safety ard Happiness.&quot; ve<br>New ideas always originate in the invididual mind; if they are good</p>
<p>ideas they will make their way and eventually be realized. — is well</p>
<p>to remember that the American political system of which we are so justly<br>proud began in just this way. The revolt against England, as I need<br>hardly point out to this audience, did not pegin because the colonists<br>wanted a new and ¢ different kind of government. Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>The colonists struggled to assert their &quot;nights as Englishmen” --notably<br>representation in Parliament and the guarantees of the Bill of Rights<br>exacted from William and Mary in 1688. - England failed to muster the<br>political sagacity to grant these rights while there was still time to<br>hold colonial demands to this modest claim. — It seems clear that until quite</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>ste in the struggle the majority of the colonists would have been satisfied</p>
<p>»</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>had they been granted equal rights with Englishmen. Even toward the end<br>of the war, the majority did not look beyond the goal of political<br>independence.</p>
<p>Along the Atlantic seaboard, the settlers had created a faithful<br>replica of England, though shorn of the top layer of the aristocracy<br>and happily free of the bottom layer. Only where the settled region “<br>ended and the wilderness. began had a new type. of society, ‘anew type of man,<br>a new way of life begun to take shape.” |</p>
<p>It was the immense achievement of the Founding Fathers to recognize<br>that this was something unique, something not existing in England or<br>anywhere else in the world, and that this new society and this new kind of<br>man could realize what the Age of Reason had only envisaged as a kind of<br>Utopia--that is, a truly free socieey in which men governed themselves.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers were steeped in the classics and were themselves<br>part of the school of thought that dominated 18th century political<br>philosophy in the Western world. Our country is a child of Rationalism.<br>It came into being pursuant to a contract--the Constitution--which was<br>submitted to and accepted by the American people. Ours was the first<br>such government, although there was something akin to it in the document<br>signed August 1, 1291, from which the Swiss date the beginning of their<br>democratic state. Like the Swiss we began with a tabula rasa; like the<br>Swiss our overriding concern was with freedom. :</p>
<p>It seems to me of utmost importance that we obaceve the order of</p>
<p>precedence in the Declaration of Independence for it shows more clearly</p>
<p>Mm</p>
<p>“=n even the Constitution what the Founding Fathers conceived democracy ~</p>
<p>A emai</p>
<p>so be. The Declaration of Independence declares first that all men are<br>born with “inalienable rights&quot; and lists some of these rights. It then<br>proceeds to state that it is &quot;to secure these rights&quot; that governments</p>
<p>are instituted among men. And finally it states flatly that government<br>derives its &quot;just powers&quot; from the consent of the governed.</p>
<p>We now hold it to be a &quot;self-evident truth&quot; that liberty is an<br>indispensable attribute of the individual. Not absolute liberty, of<br>COURSE for this is not possible unless man lives on an ‘uhinhabited island,<br>but the broadest liberty compatible with life in society. This idea, to<br>which we now all subscribe came out of the minds of but a few great men.<br>We have never since had political philosophers who could measure up to</p>
<p>the Founding Fathers. Their concept of democracy is our precious heritage.</p>
<p>I presume then that we.all here accept the proposition that technology</p>
<p>makes sense only when it produces human happiness in a free society; for</p>
<p>Amerieans at least, the two go together. Were we to prefer an affluent</p>
<p>spe</p>
<p>and wavetrss life for the freedom and responsibilities possessed by</p>
<p>democratic citizens, we ‘should pe sacrificing our heritage for a mess</p>
<p>of pottage--an inexcusable folly, no matter how good the pottage might be.<br>| Perhaps we might, for greater clarity, restate our topic to read:<br>HOW CAN WE FIND WAYS TO OBTAIN THE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT DESTROYING<br>|| OR WEAKENING OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS? .</p>
<p>So much for the first basic fact of technology: at does not dictate<br>how we use the inereased power it gives our minds and bodies.</p>
<p>Now to the second fact. In using science--which 4s what technology</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>gems--we must heed what I like to call the categorical im Hepatives of<br>science. - We must mieneot nature over which science gives us eontrol, for<br>i2 we don&#x27;t, nature will strike back. I can best illustrate this with<br>ari example. | fags<br>Today we are able to destroy insect pests and weeds with new chemicals<br>that gulence has developed. The use of these scientific inventions is |<br>profitable for those who manufacture the chemicals; it is helpful to<br>farmers who are able to get better crops, reduce human labor, and thus<br>produce at greater. profit; it benefits consumerd.iaho are offered a wider<br>variety of food at less cost. Here is a classic case of what technology<br>can do for us. Unfortunately, we have left out of consideration the<br>balance of nature. If used improperly these pesticides and weed killers may<br>poison soil, crops, animals and eventually man. Rachel Carson Warns us<br>eteduently agadagt committing. this* ecological sin in her book Silent Spring.<br>In my own field of work, I am constantly aware of the harm that<br>nuclear reactors, improperly designed or operated, could do. Radiation<br>is one of the hazards that must be constantly kept in mind. The same is</p>
<p>true to a much larger extent of nuclear bombs. We are here getting involved</p>
<p>in extremely tricky manipulation of powerful natural forces.</p>
<p>Because | the eneral public does not fully understand the categorical<br>| imperatives of selence, it cannot itself exert control in this field.<br>| Reeently,. the. United States Court. of Appeals in Washington, D. C. ruled</p>

<p>Mie. “Munford warns that sheer size, the supernumes scale of many of<br>oo organizations, damages human values that are part of our democratic<br>may of iife. ‘They dwarf man; they diminish his autonomy and thus his<br>ability to function effectively as 2 citizen exercising the power of<br>self-government. They become hureauerseten where masses of people work<br>under direction ,and little room is left for individual initiative. It</p>
<p>seems that large-scale enterprise tends irresistibly to bureaucracy,<br>whether it be private or public. Bigness thus enters our topic of<br>aiscugdion. Not all of the bigness is a direct consequence of the use<br>or misuse on technology. We are an enormously populous nation. Even<br>if times were normal, we should need big government to keep us from<br>harming one another.<br>| We are only beginning to realize that for generations we have had 4</p>
<p>population explosion. the like. of which the world has never seen. From<br>1800 to 1850 we quintupled, from 1850 to 1900 we trebled, from 1900 to.<br>1950 we doubled in numbers, and we are likely to double again by 2000.<br>When we celebrate the bicentennial of the adoption of the Constitution,<br>we will be so numerous that each of us will be left with no more than<br>about 1% the voting power possessed by Americans in our first national =<br>election. This cannot but diminish the eitizen&#x27; s sense of importance<br>and lead to political apathy, itself the greatest threat to democracy .</p>
<p>Technology. has had 1ittle to do with this growth. Other industrial<br>nations long ago cut down to- from half to one third: our. growth rate. ‘They.</p>
<p>recognized their limitations of space; we ‘have | trouble realizing that</p>
<p>we ceased long ago to pe a land where people were scarce. Jenoticed</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>~=scently in the weekly press that the greater use of poisonous</p>
<p>eeediillers in this country, compared to Europe; was justified by a high<br>‘ficial on the grounds that abroad labor was abundant while here it was</p>
<p>scarce. The opposite is, of course, true. But the change has crept</p>
<p>up on us and we haven&#x27;t noticed it.</p>
<p>When this was an underpopulated | country, every man&#x27;s worth was<br>automatically enhanced because he was: sorely ‘needed. But now we have<br>endemic unemployment which I for one believe cannot be overcome merely<br>by producing more and more consumer goods. It 4s hard to predict what<br>effect chronic unemployment may have on the sense of independence that<br>has always been so vital a part of the American character. The Founding<br>Fathers considered abundant free land as one of the pillars of the<br>democratic state they were creating. Jefferson thought that for many<br>generations to come there. would be land for the taking. He was_ convinced<br>that life in crowded ‘Europe made for rootless, propertyless people a<br>unfit to discharge the responsibilities of citizenship. But that<br>American farmers, tradesmen and merchants, owning their small businesses,<br>could manage a democracy because they had daily practice in making<br>independent decisions and’ weighing the consequence? of their Bevions.</p>
<p>Well, nine out of ten Americans now | work: ci others 8, ‘many for giant<br>organizations. Galbraith, I believe, once pointed out that the average<br>American family --heavily indebted by installment | puying-~-is put thre<br>weeks removed from pankruptcy. _ Moreover; 70% of us now live inthe<br>crowded urban conglomerations we call megalopolis. In his mistrust<br>of what he called the canaille of European cities, Jefferson for once Was</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>game - Some of the most civilized democracies nave evolved in countries<br>tet bad such cities in aoe time. We ourselves have managed the</p>
<p>ocratic process remarkably well, though We are now pereft_of every</p>
<p>tal advant2g2 the. Founding Fathers considered essential</p>
<p>single spec<br>to the success of democracy: few peoples | ‘much land, independent gmall-</p>
<p>scale enterprise, 4 and finally that greatest of all advantages » geographl<br>ssolation, which allowed us tO go about our peaceful pursuits without<br>rear of foreign invasion. De Toequeville noted that &quot;america had no<br>neighbors. « Few of us pealize what an immense advantage shat was in<br>working out our destiny on this huge and rich continent.</p>
<p>How well we, shall be able to preserve our precious democratic right<br>an the future, no one can foretell. As we climb relentlessly coward<br>the pillion mark in populations we shall ss to give thought to<br>strengthening Local and state government for it is in these smaller<br>units shat most people are most effective as citizens. Here we might do<br>to anvestigate what successful European democracies nave done. We<br>shall find that everywhere municipal government and state or provincial<br>government nave been deliberately strengthened: put ways nave neo peen<br>found to achieve national unity where this is needed.</p>
<p>Halif a century 28° Woodrow Wilson ¢ remarked » somewhat wistfully is</p>
<p>seems to. me, that Nene stage of america grows crowded. Like the stage</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>s</p>
<p>weil</p>
<p>of Europe. The life of the new world grows as complex as the yare of tne</p>
<p>ola.&quot; We still have — important advantages &gt; we still have much more Land</p>
<p>per capita; greater na tural wealth, though it is rapidly peing used Up;</p>
<p>still nave @ strong tradition of indi vidual 4nitiative. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>fa</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>@e ere neither the only, nor even ain every respect the most successful,<br>Bi eeacy--politically speaking. There are things we can learn from<br>abroad. Notably, the way standards in such fields as general education,<br>training of skilled workers and technicians, and licensing of professional<br>people are set nationally and enforced locally. Usually such standards.<br>are established by calling on the country! s pest minds to cooperate with<br>central and local authorities. Once set, most ‘of. the responsibility for<br>putting the standards into effect falls to the local authorities. It<br>is true that parliamentary democracy facilitates this, put if we gave<br>this problem careful thought and debated it widely, I. am sure we<br>could devise our own procedures. |<br>We talk a lot about &quot;state&#x27;s rights,&quot; but talk alone will not enhance<br>phe amportance of Local and state government . Unfortunately, our nomadic<br>habits are inimical to the kind of self- identification with and<br>devotion to, home towns and states that are conducive tO active citizen<br>participation in public affairs. Where some erisis or some devoted<br>“group of citizens sparks civic watnael hauls we still accomplish wonders.<br>As in the cleanup of local government that the public has done in many<br>eities. |<br>In general, however; we do not, despite our abundant leisure, concern<br>ourselves with public affairs as much as 4s necessary to the maintenance<br>of ous free society. One reads sadly in de Tocqueville&#x27;s. Report on |<br>America in the 1830&#x27;s that &quot;sf an american were condemned to confine his</p>
<p>activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of his</p>
<p>existence,” and that &quot;the interests of the country are .everywhere ‘kept</p>
<p>il</p>
<p>wiew; they are an object of solicitude to the people of the whole<br>emion, and every citizen 4s as warmly attached to them as if they cane<br>is ow.&quot; This self-identification of the eitizen with his country ©<br>wes of course much easier when 4 man could feel that his vote renaey<br>counted. | :</p>
<p>Today we are a big country living in a dangerous world. Much<br>as we deplore it, the federal government must spend vast sums on weapons<br>= imology and build up the military-industrial complex whose power.</p>
<p>President Eisenhower found so disturbing and against watch He warned |</p>
<p>us in his farewell address . As part of this complex, I try to keep my own s</p>
<p>group from. deteriorating into a pureaucracy. I spend most of my time ;<br>selecting and training the scientists and engineers in my organization.<br>As soon as they are ready, I give them respons ieilities and then leave<br>them alone. As-long as they do it well, I. do: not eare how they organize<br>their work. of am myself acutely conscious or the need for allowing Ss<br>individual initiative the widest possible lcewey in any organization,<br>large or email. How best to do this is one of the really big problems<br>we must solve. .</p>
<p>Private independence and initiative are not preserved by having a<br>plurality of huge organizations, though it is of course much better<br>than having one huge national political - -industrial organization like<br>the Soviets. It is important we see clearly that what diminishes the -<br>individual is bureaucracy turned rigid. Size tends to make organizations<br>inflexible. For those who work in them, it makes little difference</p>
<p>whether such an organization is private or public. In our country,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>effects on the individual may be fewer in a public than in a<br>grivete bureaucracy, because the individual as a citizen is able to exert<br>@ome control over the conduct of public officials and is, moreover,<br>protected by the Bill of Rights. ‘Those who work for a gigantic private<br>bureaucracy face corporate officials packed by the massive economic<br>power of the organization they control. Here Americans confront one<br>another under conditions of extreme inequality and with the weaker<br>pasrantend no &quot;inalienable rights.&quot; |</p>
<p>If we may believe the many books that have recently come. out, dealing<br>with life in the giant corporation, @ man looking for a job or for<br>advancement would appear to have to submit to a degree of 4nvasion of<br>privacy that strikes me as intolerable, besides being quite unnecessary.<br>No fifth amendment protects certain categories of job seekers against<br>being subjected to personality tests of dubious scientific value which<br>probe their goul and inquire into their family life, churchgoing habits,</p>
<p>and whether they have or do not have an interest in cultural matters.</p>
<p>Several Fortune articles describe the most extraordinary corporate &quot;“sumptuary</p>
<p>rules,&quot; reminiscent of the Middle Ages, which prescribe the type of</p>
<p>house, ear, club, even wife an ambitious “organization” man i3 well advised<br>to heed. Occasionally, he may even find it advisable to reshape his<br>personality to conform to the &quot;4mage&#x27; the corporation nas of its</p>
<p>management --the image being usually that of incumbent top personnel.</p>
<p>When one takes into consideration that in today&#x27;s corporation ownership<br>and management are almost wholly divorced, managers therefore peing no</p>
<p>less spbleyeds of the company than the lowliest scrub woman, one cannot</p>

<p>@eomervel at the erowth of such authoritarian organisms in the midst<br>ee democratic America.</p>
<p>I can only hope that articles and books on the subject exaggerate<br>or that at least most corporations do not indulge in this sort of thing.<br>But would not a single such corporation be one too many?</p>
<p>Of course, every corporation is free to manage its affairs as it<br>wishes and to hire the people it wants, put there is this ‘point to<br>eonsider: Corporations have long striven to obtain full citizenship rights<br>as &quot;persons&quot; 4n the sight of the law. They have largely attained that<br>objective. The courts for all practical purposes treat them as state<br>or federal citizens. Does achievement of citizenship status then not<br>entail on the part of corporations the obligations to assume as well<br>the civic duties of natural citizens? In law, &quot;right and obligation are<br>correlative.&quot; |</p>
<p>“he individual in our society safeguards his &quot;night&quot; of self-government<br>by exercising 4t. The Founding Fathers knew full well that merely to<br>declare all men to be possessed of “inalienable rights&quot; would be<br>meaningless unless men also controlled their government. The Constitution<br>4s the document that executes the Declaration of Independence. Citizen<br>rights are made safe by making consent of the people indispensable to<br>the functioning of government ; in other words, by associating the<br>individual with the business of governing. Citizens have public Auaetiens<br>and therefore public status. fo exercise these functions they must<br>be autonomous individuals, able to judge public issues for themselves,<br>free to associate for purposes of political action and ~ speak on public</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>pers. Freedom in private life is extremely important - Fo be an</p>
<p>geeerive citizen &amp;@ man must have what socra tes called &quot;a private station.&quot;<br>hm his Livelihood is jeopardized py engaging an civic activities, he<br>has no private freedom. | -</p>
<p>Tt seems to me 4 clear obligation for all bureaucratic organizations=~<br>private as well as public --to do nothing that will diminish individual.<br>auconomy - Public pureaucracies need constant watching. - but they oan<br>pe restrained. With private pureaucraciess the obligation cannot be<br>imposed or enforced. But it can be publicly discussed, and public<br>digapproval ean be visited on those who violate the obligation. This will<br>not be nelpfyt to the yiolator&#x27;s &quot;image.&quot;</p>
<p>T don&#x27;t think I exaggerate the effect on 4 eitizen&#x27; s 5 capacity. to<br>perform his public functions if he is overmuch dominated py meddlesome,<br>albeit perhaps well-meaning pureaucracies - Some years ag0 I read Wittfogel&#x27;s<br>Oriental despotism. Te book makes @ persuasive ease for the easy ‘eransition<br>from authoritarian technology to totalitarian state. Wittfogel deals<br>with preindustrial potalitarianisms » all characterized by peing dependent<br>for their food supply on gigantic 4rrigation or other water works. These<br>required the massing of vast armies of workers who labored under the &gt;<br>direction of sechnical &quot;experts.&quot; Wittfogel shows shat the docility<br>pred into men whose work gave no release to individual initiative facilitated<br>the sransformation of these so-called &quot;hydraulic&quot; societies into<br>gotalitarian governments. There are enough analogies to give us pause.</p>
<p>How can we guard against similar eonsequences as our lives are more bend</p>
<p>more dominated by gigantic enterprise? I have no answer except to urge</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Ghat this is a problem which will not solve itself; it must be faced and<br>sackled. And here I would suggest we recognize that what we have in<br>essence is a. CRISIS OF INTELLIGENCE. The wise use of technology calls<br>for a higher order of thinking than we have so far accorded it. We have<br>largely left it to the management of practical men. I submit that we 7<br>now have setentific knowledge of such inmensely dangerous potential<br>that. we ought to bring a broader range of intellectual power to bear<br>upon its use.<br>I think one can make a general statement that the practical approach<br>to a new | Seientific discovery is short-range and private, concerned<br>with ways. to put the discovery to use in the most economical and - efficient<br>manner , little thought being given to side etfteets and . future |<br>consequences. The scholar arly approach--if I may use this term--1s<br>long-range and public; it looks to the effects which the use of a mew<br>discovery may have on people in general, on the nation, perhaps on |<br>the world; present and future. Of course there are men who combine<br>the two approdches and you find them among people. whose primary interest<br>is seastieal; no less than among those whose primary interest is<br>scholarly. What is important is to recognize that each approach is<br>necessary to illuminate the problem and help solve it. To exclude the<br>_ one or the other prevents finding a2 way to reconcile technology and<br>democracy.<br>| I can best illustrate what I want to bring out. here by a simple<br>example. Commercial deep-sea fishing can now be done so efficiently with<br>modern techniques. that a-relatively few enterprises eould ‘papidly .sweep<br>16</p>
<p>. oceans free of commercial fish and whales. Left to themselves, this<br>s what the fishermen of all nationalities would do. As practical men<br>they are interested only in how new technology will increase their catch,</p>
<p>‘preserve it and get it as speedily as possible to market. They have</p>
<p>been quite ingenious in pursuing this short-range private objective.<br>Figuratively speaking, the world&#x27;s marine scholars have stood by wringing<br>their hands at this &quot;practical&quot; folly. To them it has peen incomprehensible<br>that reasonable human beings should fail to see that in the end far more<br>can be taken from the sea if fishing conforms to sensible conservation<br>regulations permitting the species to reproduce itself. . -<br>Conservation has had extremely hard sledding in this country pecause .<br>we worship practical men and have little respect for scholars. This is not<br>an intelligent point of view in today&#x27;s world. ,<br>Many activities that in the past eould safely be left to private</p>
<p>decision 1 now involve such complex relationships ‘and such potentially _<br>dangerous consequences that they need all the intelligence we can: muster</p>
<p>merely to be fully understood, not to mention the need to solve them</p>
<p>in ways that will preserve our democratic way of life. This way of life 7 Z<br>is infinitely precious and worth preserving at all cost. It is also capable<br>| of giving our society great flexibility and immense strength. Therefore<br>the most pragtical person will surely have no. difficulty recognizing that<br>by giving our democratic institutions: primacy over habitual ways of using<br>technology, we preserve for ourselves and our children the greatest single<br>| advantage our way of life gives us. It is not affluence of. consumer goods<br>| put freedom that will let us prevail in the grim struggle for survival<br>that has peen forced upon us.</p>
