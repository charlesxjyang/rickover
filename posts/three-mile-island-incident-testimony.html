      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s May 24, 1979 statement outlines the comprehensive philosophy and rigorous approach to nuclear safety within the Naval Reactors Program, reflecting his 60 years of experience. He highlights the program&#x27;s impressive operational record, with 127 nuclear-powered ships (including 115 submarines, 3 aircraft carriers, and 8 cruisers) accumulating over 1,800 reactor-years and 40 million miles steamed without a single naval reactor accident. Rickover emphasizes a strong environmental and occupational safety record, noting minimal radioactivity discharges and low personnel exposure. A key theme is &quot;total responsibility&quot; from design to operation, rejecting simple solutions in favor of deep technical competence, conservative design, and meticulous attention to detail. The statement details a multi-phased, highly demanding training program for over 7,000 officers and 40,000 enlisted personnel, encompassing extensive classroom, prototype, and shipboard instruction, continuous qualification, frequent examinations, and stringent oversight through audits and incident reports to ensure unparalleled safety and performance.</p>

        <p>Statement of admiral h. G. Rickover, USN before the subcommittee on energy research and production of the committee on science and technology U.S. house of representatives may 24, 1979</p>
<p>You have asked me to appear before your subcommittee in order to discuss my own perspective on nuclear safety and 70 describe the philosophy and approach of the naval reactor safety program, the views I will express are my own based on 60 years gf government service. They do not necessarily reflect those of my superiors of any government agency.</p>
<p>] will begin by describing the extent of the naval reactors prograam. Today 115 nuclear powered submarines are in operation; 4] of these are ballistic missile firing submarines and 74 are attack submarines. Twenty-three additional attack submarines and seven TRIDENT submarines are authorized for construction. We also have one nuclear powered deep submergence research and ocean engineering vehicle. Three nuclear powered aircraft carriers are in operation, and one more is being built, eight nuclear</p>
<p>Built, .. “Sether, 127 nuclear powered ships are in operation. In addition, | AM responsible for the shippingport atomic power station, including muclear ships, the naval prototype. Reactors, and the shippingport station, | AM responsible for the gpepation of 154 reactors,</p>
<p>Since the USS NAUTILUS first put to sea in 1955, navae nuclear powered ships have steamed over 40 million miles and have accumulated over 1800 reactor~years of operation. We have procured 508 nuclear cores, and have performed 166 refuelings. Some 300 large businesses and over 1000 small businesses produce equipment for the navat reactors procram,</p>
<p>In the twenty~six years since the NAUTILUS lanp prrototype first operated there has never been an accident involving a naval. Reactor, no? Has there been any release of radioactivity</p>
<p>Which has had a significant ef fect on the environment, for example, in each of the last eight years, the total gamma radioactivity in liquids, less tritium, discharged within 12 miles of shore from all our nuclear powered ships; supporting tenders, naval bases and nine shipyards, was less than two thousandths of a curie. If one person were able to drink</p>
<p>Each year | issue a report which describes in detail the record of discharges of radioactivity to the environment from naval ship operations and describes our methods of control and environmental monitoring. With your permission l will provide the subcommittee with a copy of this report ror 1978 for the record,</p>
<p>For the past two years there has been increased public and congressional interest IX the wealth effects due to low level radiation. | AM neither an expert on radiation health effects nor AM I responsible for setting the national occupational exposure limits. But I AM responsible for the use of these</p>
<p>&amp; second document | would like to provide for the record provides the occupational radiation exposure record for civilian and military people involved in navy nuclear propulsion and their support facilities, on pace 2 of this report, there is a graph which shows the total occupational radiation exposures to personnel operating ships and to employees in the shipyards. In 1978 the total operator and worker exposure was about one quarter the amount in the peak year 1966, even though tre number of nuclear~powered ships nearly doubled.</p>
<p>As identified in the document, since 1967 no civilian or military personnel in the navy's nuclear propulsion program have exceeded the quarterly federal limit of 3 rem or an annual radiation exposure limit of 5 rem. The average anni's exposure of shipyard workers in 1978 was one quarter of a rem. The average annual exposure of ship operators in 1978 was one tenth of a rem, this document also outlines many of the measures implemented to achieve the record of. Occupational radiation exposure we have attained,</p>
<p>| believe both reports wili. Be of value to the purpose of this hearing, because they convey something of the kind of care and attention to detail we have taken in order to maintain a level of assurance that both the public and the people in the program are protected,</p>
<p>Since the incident at the three mile island site, | have been asked by many people to comment, there are several reasons why 1 have not done this. First, all the facts are not in, and it would be presumptuous on my part to make judgments on such a highly complex subject when | do not have the facts, second, there are significant differences between the design and operation of naval reactors and plants such as the three mice island plant. 1 want to weigh all aspects of the incident and see if there /S anything from it | can learn and incorporate into the naval program, that is the way | have always operated,</p>
<p>Another important aspect is the legal issue involved, Iv is yet 10 be decided who will pay all the various costs for the incident. It would not be appropriate for a government employee such as myself to be issuing pronouncements on the incident when there may be litigation,</p>
<p>There are, however, a number of facts which have been released by the nuclear regulatory commission regarding three mtle islanp, these facts seem to me to reinforce many of the underlying basic principles of the naval reactors program,</p>
<p>Over the years, many people have asked me how | run the naval reactors program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. | AM always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that | have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. They are disappointed when they find ou there 8S none. Any successful program functions as an integra” =d whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends</p>
<p>Problems, asked me for a copy of one specific proucdure i</p>
<p>One of the elements needed in solving a complex technical problem 1S to have the individuals who make the decisions trained in the technology involved, a concept widely accepted in some circles 1S that all you need is to get a college degree in management and then, regardless of the technical subject, you can apply your management techniques to run any program; including the presidency, congress, or the vatican. This has become a tenet of our modern society,</p>
<p>Bur rt is 2 slid as the once widely held precept that the world 1S flat, properly running a sophisticated technical program requires a fundamental understanding of and commitment to the technical aspects of the job and a willingness 70 pay infinite attention to the technical details, this can only</p>
<p>Be done by one who understands the details and their implications the phrase “the devil is in the details” is especially true for technical work, if you ignore those details and attempt to rely on management techniques or gimmicks you will surely end up with a system that 1$ unmanageable, and problems will be immensely more difficult to solve. At naval reactors, I take individuals who are good engineers and make them into managers. They do not manage by gimmicks but rather by knowledge, logic, common sense, and hard work,</p>
<p>Another essential element 1S that of responsibility, in the beginning of the naval program it was apparent to me that due 9 the uniqueness of nuclear power and its potential effect on public safety, a new concept of total responsibility had to be established both within the navy and the then atomic enersy commission (AEC). It would not work if one person was responsible for nuclear power plants in the navy, and a different person responsible in the AEC. Similarly, it would not work if there was one person in the the AEC</p>
<p>Responsible for the naval program with a different pexs0n responsible for the AEC laboratcries doing the work for the naval reactor program, it would not work in the navy if five or six different admirals all had charge of different pieces of the program, as 1S often the case in other areas, it would not work if there was one person responsible for research and development, someone else responsible for construction, and another responsible for training and operation, and still another for repair work:</p>
<p>This kind of compartmentalization of responsibility is “typical in government work, but the practice of having shared responsiblity really means that no one is responsible: it reminds me of the &amp;1gure in nest's cartoon of the tweed ring, where all of the characters stand in a circle, each one pointing his thumb at his neighbor as the responsible person, unless you can point your finger at the one person who is responsible when something goes wrong, then you have never had anyone really responsible,</p>
<p>For these reasons, | did all | could to gain support for my concept of total responsibility. Tt required that a single position fe established to handle both the navy and the AEC parts of the job, | think it might be of value to this subcommittee to outline how this designation of responsibility</p>
<p>Was derived from the atomic enersy act of 1954, and how it</p>
<p>Ts carried gut all the way down to the ships, whether in constructio” “peration, or overhaul. I have such an outline and with your permission I would like to include it in the record with my statement,</p>
<p>Jo _</p>
<p>I will now discuss in greater detail the underlying. Basic principles of the naval reactors program,</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the naval nuclear propulsion program | recognized that there were a large number of engineering proslems in putting a naval reactor into a submarine, some problems were unique to submarine application, and some to the general problem of making a reactor plant work. | realized at the time that the use of nuclear power, as with any new sophisticated technglogy, would require the institution of novel requirements and standards, I realized that these requirements would necessarily be difficult to meet, and the standards would need to be more stringent than</p>
<p>Pa</p>
<p>Those which kad been used in power plants up to that time, but when you a,c at the frontiers of science you must be ’ prepared to accept the discipline this requires in order to proceed. The fact that the application of nuclear power was almost entirely an engineering problem - not a problem of</p>
<p>Nuclear physics, as nearly all of the “experts” then believed ~ was clear to me. The emphasis I have placed on sound, conservative engineering has been a major factor in the performance of our plants,</p>
<p>1 should point out that in the late 1940's and early 1950's, when the original naval nuclear propulsion plant design studies began there were no standards, design guides, or codes available, they had to be developed. Due to the military application, these design criteria included considerations of reljability, battle damage, high shock and the close proximity of the crew to the reactor plant. Jhe propulsion plant design had to be readily maintainable so possible equipment failures at sea could be repaired. The fact that major maintenance operations would be infrequent and refueling possibly / seldom as once in a ship's lifetime, required that standards for materials and systems be very rigorous and that only premium products which had a proven pedigree could be considered for use, my design objective is and has been to provide a warship that can be relied upon to perform</p>
<p>I will explain some of the elements of good engineering as | have applied them to the reactor plants for which | AM responsible. First, in any engineering endeavor, and particularly in an advanced field such as nuclear power, conservatism [5S necessary, so as tg allow for possible unknown and unforeseen effects, this conservatism must be built into the design from the very beginning. If the basic design is not conservative, it quickly becomes impracticable to provide the needed conservatism, it then becomes necessary tg add complexities to the system in an attempt to compensate for the inadequacies of the basic design, [these complexities, in turn, serve to reduce conservatism and reliability.</p>
<p>] must make it clear that the military requirements which must be met by naval propulsion reactors are far more exacting than those which central station plants must endure, for example, the shock loadings for which naval plants are designed are far greater than the earthquake shock loadings for civilian plants. In addition, naval plants must be able to accomodate power transiekts much more rapidly than civilian plants, each naval vessel depends entirely on its own reactor plant for the capability to perform its mission, for a ship there is no inter-connected grid to pick up the load and allow the ship to continue functioning, the stringent</p>
<p>Some specific examples of the conservatism in design which [| have used are!</p>
<p>6 use of ordinary water of high purity as the reactor coolant, water has been widely used in industrial applications; its properties are well~known, and when irradiated, has short~lived radioactivity,</p>
<p>@ design of the reactor plant to enable it to accomodate expected transients, without the need for immediate operator action. [His means the plant is inherently stable, and helps the operator when there is an unusual transient.</p>
<p>@ use of a land-based prototype of the same design as the shipboard plant. This prototype plant can be tested and subjected to the potential transients a shipboard plant will experience, prigr to operation of the shipboard plant.</p>
<p>@ provining extensive detailed operating procedures and manuals, prepared and approved by technical people knowledgeable of the plant design. These manuals are constantly updated as we learn from the operations of the many other reactors. What we learn on one plant is incorporated into all our plants,</p>
<p>E@ use of frequent, thorough, and detailed audits of all aspects of the program by individuals who are specifically selected and trained,</p>
<p>@ in addition to the detailed technical review and approval by my office, the safety aspects of operation of naval nuclear powered ships are independently reviewed ry the nuclear regulatory commission and the advisory committee on reactor safeguards,</p>
<p>Approach io_new reactors</p>
<p>The kind of engineering approach [| have just outlined is, in my opinion, why the naval reactors program has resulted in safe» reliable nuclear power. [0 the casual reader much , * of what | have said may appear obvious, but I assure you it 1S not when you try to carry out these concepts in everyday work. | have encountered many cases where these ideas are ignored gr not understood. I have, on many occasions, reviewed proposals for smaller, lighter, and cheaper reactors. While such proposals have covered a wide variety of reactor concepts, they have been completely consistent in one respect) they have all involved the sacrifice of sound, conservative engineering to achieve a design theoretically having better performance. They each violated most, if not all of the engineering principles I have uust discussed, they would ali have been, in my opinion, unsafe and unsatisfactory for naval warship application. How often have you known of cases where in the fervor of winning contracts, firms will promise all kinds of performance, only to be found incapable of delivering it when they try to make the equipment work, by 7his, | do not mean we should ngt make improvements. We have, but at all stages you must proceed in accordance with ‘sound, conservative engineering practices if you are to produce something that will work, vice something that is just an expensive piece of unre( [able and unsafe junk,</p>
<p>As an * omple, | have often been pressed to reduce radiation shielding to make new ships smaller and lighter. However, if | removed 100 tons of radiation shielding from a typical submarine, the ship would be only two percent lighter, but the radiation exposures to ship personnel would increase to. Ten times the current levels. | have not agreed to reducing shielding because | believe radiation exposure to personnel should be as low as | can reasonably obtain.</p>
<p>Another element in my approach to safe operation of naval reactor plants involves the selection and training of the operators. In brief, | consider the training of officers and men to be at least as important as any other element of the navy nuci.ear power program. | consider it of the greatest importance that the mental abilities, qualities of judgment. And level of training, be commensurate with the responsibility involved in operating a nuclear reactor. The selection of personne! And their training in the naval nuclear power program are carried out with these considerations in mind:</p>
<p>Academic ability, personal character as demonstrated by any acts reflecting unreliability, and honest desere for the nuclear program are all taken into account in selection of - personnel. Once selected for the naval nuclear power program, the individua!l I$ continually subject to review. Le</p>
<p>Lo accomplish these objecteves, 1 re@uire a one year training period prior 10 an oplrator going on board his first nuclear ship. The first s1x months of nuclear power training are spent at nuclear power schooi in orlando, florida, where the curriculum concentrates on the theoretical basis for shipboard systems. Upon graduation from nuclear power school the student reports to one of our land-based prototype plants where he learns. To actually operate the propulsion plant. There the student must demonstrate that he can operate the plant under normal and casualty conditions, and is taught to operate in strict compliance with detailed operating and casualty procedures.</p>
<p>I established the naval nuclear power training program on a base of rigid high standards, my staff at naval reactors approves the curriculum at nuclear power school and the qualification guides used to develop the prototype and shipboard operator qualificaiton programs, this ensures that the standards are not reduced by someone who does not understand the overall goals of the program, and that the individuals responsible for the design and construction of the reactor plant systems are involved in the training considerations on that system,</p>
<p>Wi also require operators 7o be able to demonstrate their practical knowledge in order to become qualified at the land-based prototype, these individuals must subsequently qualify on board ship. | AM not satisfied with bringing an operator to a qualified level once, and then forgetting about him, therefore, we continually reinforce theoretical and practical training with a continuing training program. This includes frequent practice in plant evolutic 5 and casualty drills.</p>
<p>Inspections of personnel in the fleet are conducted by members of my staff, both those in the field and from headquarters; ay the fleet nuclear propulsion examining boaards established by the chief of naval operations; and by nuclear trained personnel on various other naval staffs. | review the results of all their inspections.</p>
<p>] have established a formal system of reporting propulsion plant problems which identifies areas which need improvement in the training program. | also require the commanding officer of each nuclear powered ship to write me periodically</p>
<p>These are just the main elements of the training efforts in my program. Because training I$ so important. I want to provide a much more detailed description of what we do for your record. I know you do not have time for me to read this description now, but I strongly recommend that all the committee members read it because it may be of value in your review, .</p>
<p>What | have presented at this point represents the main substance of my statement. In it | have outlined what I do in running the naval reactors program., Even when these measures are carried out it is important to recognize that mistakes will be made, because we are dealing with machines and they cannot be made perfect. The human body is gop’s finest creation and yet we get sick, if we cannot have perfect human beings then why should we expect, philosophically. Tray machines designed by human beings will be more perfect than their creatons? That 1S what many unthinking people demand even though the lord himself did not reach thts height. It believe if you follow the practices of conservative</p>
<p>Engineering and personnel training | have outlined and if you carry them out with steadfast commitment, nuclear power can be safely used, even taking into account mistakes that will inevitably occur. That 15 the basis on which I have conducted all my work in this field and I believe it true just as strongly today as I ever have.</p>
<p>As well as anyone in this room, | recognize that nuclear power is a very difficult subject for anyone to deal with, it involves energy ~ a vital element in our nation's future, it involves individuals’ concerns for themselves and their families, and it is a highly technical, sophisticated technology. Ultimately, the decision as to whether we will have nuc(.ear power is a political one - in the true sense of the word - that 1S, one made by the people through their elected representatives, [t 18 vital that the decision be made on the basis of fact, not rhetoric, not conjecture or hope, or as a result of the widespread tendency to sensationalize the current jpic and ignore the real limits or risks of the</p>
<p>| also remember the optimistic projections made for nuclear power when it was first being developed. These sprang from hope and from ignorance of the real engineering problems that would be encountered in using nuclear power, there 1S no reason to believe that current projections for alternate means of providing large amounts of power are any more precise. Any large scale generation of power involves</p>
<p>Major engineering difficulties and potential environmental impacts «</p>
<p>The job of this committee and the congress in the days ahead will not be easy, | hope and pray you will find the strength and wisdom to make the right decisions. 1 also hope that my testimonty will in some way contribute to your difficult deliberations.</p>
<p>| will now discuss in greater depth the personnel aspects of the naval nuclear propulsion program, I will describe what is involved in the selection, training, qualification, and requalification of the operators; and | will describe the methods and procedures used to ensure that policies and directives of the nuclear program are carried out, as | have previously stated, all of these elements must mesh for the system to work, you cannot separate out and use the pieces which you like, and discard those which are “tog hard’,</p>
<p>By the same token, it is impossible to separate training from the technical side of the nuclear program, within the navat reactors headquarters organization, all of the engineers are very much aware of the impact of engineering decisions on the operating personnel and of the requirements for training on new equipment or procedures. This is also true for the engineers who work at our two laboratories, also, many of th more experienced engineers in nava reactors headquarters assist in certain phases of the personnel selection process for operators and are directly involved in the training conducted at naval reactors,</p>
<p>You should also note the longevity of experienc. At naval reactors, not just as it relates to me but as it is manifested in the large majority gf people in my headquarters organization. Approximately one~fourth of my headquarters engineers have been in the naval reactors program for more than twenty years, this experience and stability is important not just in training but in all aspects gf the program,</p>
<p>When the nuclear propulsion program started, more than thirty years ago, | realized it was necessary to have excellence in operating personnel. In view of the poss!ble serious consequences of a reactor accident | considered it of utmost importance that the operation of nuclear powered ships be entrusted only to those whose mental abilities, qualities of judgment and degreee of training were commensurate with the public responsibility involved. The personnel selection and training procedures for the navat. Nuclear propulsion program were developed with these considerations in mind. They have evolved with experience over the last twenty~five years and are still changing. I do not say that use of these methods is the only way, but this is the way iy has been found to work in the naval program, and } do ngt know of a better way</p>
<p>‘o po iv. [re | pip, | WOULD USE IT.</p>
<p>Earlier in my statement I discussed the general pprinc:ples ] have used to form the basis of the naval nuclear propulsion</p>
<p>Training, a7 “sen attempt to show how these are achieved,</p>
<p>“Requent inspections of plants and plant operations by personnel assigned to the plant and by higher authority with systematic follow up on deficiencies, a feedback system in which design, material, personnel and procedural problems are brought promptly to my personal attention together with the corrective action required in each case,</p>
<p>The responsibilities involved in operating naval nuclear powered ships and the requirements of the nuclear plants themselves make it essential that individuals in the program have a high degree of intelligence and capacity to learn, early in the program | recognized that normal procedures of personnel selection and assignment used by the navy could not be counted on to provide this program with the proper type of individual. [N order to select candidates of the necessary intellectual capacity and motivation, a number of special measures had to be taxen, however, 1 could not just follow typical civilian procedures. Recognition had to be given to the fact that I was dealing with a body of military people. This meant we would be faced with the inevitable high turnover rate, the problems typical of young, inexperienced enlisted men, and the antiquatid navy training methods,</p>
<p>Those having “AD previous shipboakd expertence, while | knew this was wot the best way, | had no choice. As the number of nuclear-powered ships grew, the source of sea- experienced officers became insufficient to support the needs. Therefore, beginning in 1960, a number of top ranking | students graduating from the navan acapemy, nrotc colleges, and from the navy's officer candidate school were selected to enter nuclear power training following graduation, in 1969 the nuclear power orficer canpipate (nupoqc) program was added through which top graduates of all colleges are given the opportunity to apply for nuclear power tpaining. Today, these programs which take officers directly from the naval © academy or civilian colleges account for more than 952% of the officers entering the nuclear training program. To pate, some 7,000 officers have been trained in the nuclear power program,</p>
<p>In order to further ensure that only officers with the necessary potential and motivation are selected for the naval nuclear propulsion program, the candidates are each called to washington and interviewed by several senior members of my staff and finally by me. In addition to providing information over and above that available in an officer's service record on his intelligence and ability, these interviews are useful in determining the willingness of the officer to undertake the difficult training program for nuclear propulsion assignment and his interest in professional advancement as evidenced by his work and study habits.</p>
<p>This process of interviewing has been criticized for vears by many senior naval officers. | AM continually asked fo abolish this procedure with the suggestion that all I need to do is set down some standards on academic requirements and all those who meet them can be ordered into training.</p>
<p>If they pass the rigorous training program then they are acceptable. There are a number of reasons why | do not agree with this suggestion. First of all, the interviews are able to detect an individual who may have good school grades but who is really incapable of passing the course.</p>
<p>This has deen particularly true over the past fifteen years when college grades have generally lost meaning. It is a waste of money and effort to allow a person to enter training who then fails, particularly if you can predict the failure ahead of time, the other reason I insist on the interviews 1S more basic, some candidates may have perfectly fine grades and could undoubtedly pass the academic portion of the course. However, they may have absolutely no capability to be put in charge of the operation of a reactor plant, if I can not be convinced in my own mind that that officer can “be taught to carry out his duties responsibly with regard to the safe operation of the reactor plant at sea under trying conditions, then I cannot and will not accept him. To me “this is a very important part of the program,</p>
<p>As in the case of officers, in the early years of the nuclear program enlisted candidates came from the fleet and wad st ‘board engineering experience, those who applied were interviewed and screened by their commanding officers before being recommended as candidates. Eligibility criteria were established by the chief of naval personnel with the advice and assistance of naval reactors. Assignment to the nuclear program was made by the bureau of naval personnel</p>
<p>The manning requirements for the expanding nuclear submarine program and the nuclear surface ship program required a new source of people for training. In 1957 direct input of enlisted men for nuclear propulsion training was provided by a program of recruiting promising young high school graduates into the navy, specifically for ultimate duty in nuclear ship engineering departments, today this program is the primary source of enlisted personnel for nuclear power training. Approximately 40,000 enlisted operators have completed the naval nuclear propulsion training program to date.</p>
<p>The supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants require a high level of competence, reliability, and expertise. For these reasons high selection criteria were established early in the program. Later, as the number of personnel in the program increased, we experienced higher attrition in the training cycle, to reduce this attrition, the educational selection criteria were made more restrictive.</p>
<p>Least a &quot;c&quot; p- s@uivalent grade in that course. Additionally, all candidates must demonstrate high academic ability in the areas of math and science as measured by the armed services vocational aptitude battery tests and the nuclear field qualification test. These are administered by the navy recruiting command prior to an applicant's selection for nuclear training. These tests give an indicaiton of the applicant's ability to handle the study of mathematics and physics} subjects which form the basis of the nuclear power training curriculum,</p>
<p>Selection of nuclear personnel, officer or enlisted, must necessarily require an in-nepth review of a candidate’ $ character in addition to his academic capability: for this reason, any person who has been convicted of, or who is identified as having committed, a serious offense will not be accepted, a single minor offense involving moral turpitude or which evidences unreliability may be considered disqualifying. Frequent traffic violations or accidents that indicate unreliab!:, ty, recklessness of character, or basic disregard for authority may also be cause for denying entry into the nuclear program.</p>
<p>Used, possessed or sold /arijuana or other drugs wil. Of denied entry into or continuation in the nuclear program. Anyone showing signs of being or becoming addicted to alcohol 1S also excluded from entry into the program. Waivers for entry into the nuclear power program may be granted in the case of pre-service use of marijuana where it can be established that the usage was of an infrequent experimental nature and eurther use has been stopped. A waiver of this type may</p>
<p>Only be granted by the commander, navy recruiting command</p>
<p>With the concurrence of the chief of naval personnel: | personnel on my staff at naval reactors review and concur in each case in which a waiver 1S granted.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that these waivers may be granted only for pre-service use of marijuana, the illegal use of any drug, including marijuana, after entry into the service is not tolerated. This comes to light from time to time and all individuals involved are immediately removed from further duty involving nuclear power, no matter how exemplary their subsequent performance may be, they are not allowed to return as nuclear propulsion plant operators,</p>
<p>Initial naval training of enlisted personnel selected for nuclear training 1S conducted at several training sites throughout the country. During basic recruit training, the candidate is screened and classified into one of the program ratings (machinist's mate, electrician’s mate, interior communications, or electronics technician) according to his capabilities and the needs of the program. The trainee then attends appropriate navy class #\&quot; schoool training, which varies in length from two to five months. The curricula are: basic to the ratings and are not specialized for nuclear power, these class “a” schools are operated by the chief of naval education and training, and are not controlled by nava peactors. Nuclear program trainees completing class “a” scpyool training will normally be ordered directly to nuclear power schoot at orlando, florida.</p>
<p>The convent tonal navy in technical fields. In addition, nearly all of the navy's requirements for nuclear trained personnel are for sea duty. Therefore, Iv fs !mportant that nuclear trained personnel are able to fill general navy</p>
<p>The objective of the naval nuclear propulsion training program is to prepare officers and enlisted engineering personnel to discharge thein responsirility for safe and effective operation of propulsion plants of nuclear~powered ships. This is accomplished by teaching them: (1) the principles of science and engineering which are fundamental [to the design, construction, and operation of naval nuclea2 propulsion plants; and (2) the details and practical knowledgf</p>
<p>The nuclear propulsion training program began in 1951 with the engineering officers and crew of the NAUTILUS. The initial theoretical training was given at the atomic energy commission’® ‘aval reactors laboratory in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. When construction of the NAUTILUS prototype in idaho was sufficiently advanced, the trainees were transferred to the prototype where they continued both theoretical and operational training. Upon reporting to the NAUTILUS at the building yard, detailed shipboard training was conducted throughout the construction, test, and trial period, under</p>
<p>| l | | |</p>
<p>Supervision of naval reactors and contractor personnel, &amp; similar program was commenced in 1953 for vhe seawolf encineerine officers and men at the atomic energy commission navat. Reactors laboratory and prototype site in west micron, new york. As the number of nuclear-powered ships authorized for construction increased, it was recognized that a program capable of training large numbers of officers and enlisted men should se established. The navac nucitear power schoot was established at new lonpon, connecticut in january, 1956 and graduated its first class of nuclear submarine officers in june, 1956. This school was subsequently relocated at bainbridge, maryland,</p>
<p>Academic training for sur: (ce ship officers was continued at the idahg prototype site until 1959 when a seconn naval nuclear power school was established at mare islanp, california, for both surface and submarine personnel, from 1959 until 1376 all formal academic training for officers and enlisted personnel in the naval nuclear program was carried gut at one of these two navat nuc.ear power scuoots. In 1976, the school at bainbridge, maryland was move to oplando, florida and in 1977 the school at mare islany, zalifornia merged with the nuclear puwer school, orlando, where all formal academic training is presently conducted,</p>
<p>The purposé of hayat nuclear power school, orlando 1$ to teach officer and enlisted students those principles of science and engineering fundamentals necessary for the understanding of the operation of naval nuclear propulsion plants, and to prepare them for future assignment to prototype training and eventual responsibilities relating to the safe and effective operation of propulsion plants of nuclear powered ships,</p>
<p>In pursuit of this purpose we set high standards and we stick to them, we stress that the operator must be trained in basic principles, soq that he knows not only what he is doing, but why, ‘he teach basic theory, principles of the basic components and systems, and application of these systems and theory to watchstation duties. The students are tested with frequent and demanding examinations to be sure their knowledge can be applied, not just their memory exercised, we motivate them to perform, and 2o not allow them to proceed at their own pace, if I~ is tog slow, classroom instruction takes priority over everytr.ing else at nuccear power schooc,</p>
<p>Nuclear power school is comprised of four departments under a commanding officer and executive officer, a pre-school department, enlisted department, officer department, and</p>
<p>The commanding officer is responsible for the academic program, he certifies that instructors are technically prepared to teach, approves the examinations, monitors the performance of the instructors and recommends student disenrollments.</p>
<p>Department heads are responsible for the course content specified in approved topical guides. They are responsible for instructor training, review of proposed examinations, and monitoring the performance of instructors in their respective departments «</p>
<p>The commanding officer of nuclear power school has already served as commanding officer of a nuclear powered ship. The fxecutive officer is nuclear trained and has served as the executive officer of a ship. The academic department heads have all served as engineer officers of nuclear powered ships,</p>
<p>The instructors at nuclear power school come from two sources: (1) direct input officers aecruited specifically tg serve as instructors. They ak selecyep by naval reactors in the same manner 45 officer students but must meet higher academic criteria in their educational field, after a six week navy indoctrination course at newport, rhode island, they report to nuclear power school to teach for their four year tour of</p>
<p>In thelr agatemec specialty, (2) gfficer and enlisted instructors who have already completed a tour of sea duty on a nuclear powered ship. Jypically these sea returnee instructors have graduated in the top fifty percent of their nuclear power school and prototype classes, they also have an excellent fleet performance record, officer instructors $0 assigned have already qualified to serve as engineer officer of a nuclear powered ship.</p>
<p>The purpose of pre-nuclear power school 1S to bring all enlisted students to a common acceptable level in mathematics and physics} to prepare students medically and administratively for enrollment; and to teach students how yo study, the length of pre-school is either six or three weeks depending upon the ~ indicated academic ability of the student based on the nuclear crelp qualification test score and previous navy school | performance. The pre-school curriculum 1S not part of the huclear dower schcol curriculum for training the individual to be a nuclear propulsion plant operator. Pre-school gives students with weak high school academic backgrounds a better opportunity to pass the rigorous nuclear power school course; it also cacilitates assignment of personnel so that less time js wasted between completion of navy rating school and commencement of</p>
<p>Divisions each headed by a division director, the division director 1S responsible for the subject content of the course in accordance with approved topical guides} for training his instructors; and for preparing all of his examinations, the academic divisions concentrate on the quality of their teaching, the quality of their group extra instruction and individual tutoring which</p>
<p>The officer department 1S organized in a similar manner to the enlisted department, with the exception that the instructors also fill a military role as advisors and counselors,</p>
<p>The role of the bettis technical consultants is to act as ® technical advisor to nuclear power school staff, maintain liaison between nuclear power school and the bettis atomic power | aboratory, and monitor nuclear power school effectiveness, they also assist the instructors in preparing and presenting the course</p>
<p>The nuclear power school curriculum is prepared under my direction by the naval reactors staff in washington. The assistance of the naval reactors laboratories 1S utilized in developing the curriculum, the course at nuclear power school lasts six months and consists of approximately 700 hours of</p>
<p>Classroom ins+auction,</p>
<p>The curriculum 1S carefully organized to provide the principles of science and engineering necessary for understanding the operation of naval nuclear propulsion plants, each subject serves as a building block supporting the students further training. For example: the reactor plant systems subject matter supports the heat transfer and fluid flow subject. Mathematics supports all subjects, physics supports reactor principles, chemistry, and radiological fundamentals subjects, all courses use shipboard examples when explaining concepts. For example, in mathematics the instructor avolds using abstract equations and uses the formul#s from the subjects that will be</p>
<p>Control of the curriculum starts with topical guides. There is a topical guide for every subject taught at nuclea’? Power school, the topical guide is originated by the nuclear power school staff, reviewed by the bettis laboratory, and</p>
<p>Approved by naval reactors, the purpose of a topical guide is to regulate the subject by specifying what must be covered, the order in which the topics must be covered, the time allotted for each topic, and when examinations must be given, lesson plans are developed from these topical guides for use in teaching a class, in addition, student learning objectives are developed from the topical guides. These objectives tell the students what they should be getting out of the course.</p>
<p>The basis for textbook and other document selection is that they will directly support nuclear power subjects, as well as include additional information to challenge even the best student, manuals are prepared for nuclear power school for use by the school, the prototypes, and the ships in the fleet, these manuals are prepared by the bettis orn kapl aboratories and approved by naval reactors prior to issue. Use of commercial texts for some subjects are approved by naval reactors. Reactor plant manuals and other technical manuals are used for instructor reference, rooks containing practice problems for each subject are prepared by the nuclear power schoo, and given to students to be used throughout the</p>
<p>Required to take the subject hs will teach, he will give poactice lectures and become familiar with related nuccearr power schdol subjects, the new instructor must pass oral boards on the technical content of the course, and present a certification lecture for the division director, the department head, and the commanding officer. He must also pass an oral certification boarl by the division director, the department head, and the commanding officer. After qualification, the training continues so that</p>
<p>Annual written examination is administered to all instructors to determine any weak areas. Jhe instructor's classroom presentation is audited at least twice during each period he teaches a subject, thc commanding officer, the ex®cutive officer and the department heads are required to audit one instructor each week, also bettis technical consultants randomly monitor the instructors. Evaluation reports are filled out by the auditors and discussed with the instructor, these reports are forwarded up the chain gf command and filed in the instructor training folder after any necessary: corrective action has been taken,</p>
<p>Mast nat tons</p>
<p>Guestions are used on any examinations at nuclear power sckool. As</p>
<p>Careful quality control is exercised in the preparation and administration of examinations, each examination is written and reviewed by two members of the academic division. A trial examination is given to another member as a check on any problems which may arise with the questions on the examination or the time allotted for the examination, the examination is then reviewed and .pproved by the academic division director, the department head, the bettis technical consultant and finally the commanding orercer, examinations are reviewed to insure that they meet the objectives of the subject topical guides, are technically accurate, and have acceptable answers on the answer keys, they must meet the standards of difficulty for the individual questions and for the total examination,</p>
<p>After .'e examination has been given and graded it is reviewed by the instructor with all of his students during the next class period, at thes time the instructor discusses the concepts that gave the students the most difficulty, if a student fails an examination, the instructor interviews him to analyze his performance on the examination, so that corrective</p>
<p>Student performance is continously monitored, instructors monitor student performance by grading daily homework, giving frequent quizzes and a 2 to 3 hour examination about every 10 days. Advisors monitor the students performance by interviewing students who have academic problems weekly, and every student av least every two weeks. The advisor reviews records of student study hours for correlation with the student's academic perpormance, I— the student’s grades are below average he is required to sign in whenever he studies at the school so that his study hours can — be checked. The advisor also monitors the student by attending the lectures and observing the student's participation, in addition, the advisor meets with all his student's instructors at least every two weeks to discuss individual or group student performance. The class director meets weekly with the advisors and the advisors report keekly by memorandum to the commanding officer via the chain of command, this weekly memo discusses academic, military or personal problems that the students may</p>
<p>The senior staff, the commanding qfficer, executive officer, and academic devarrtment heads, observe one section weekly, these observations coupled with grade repgrts and section advisor memos, insure that the chain of command 1S current on the quality of student performance and on student problems,</p>
<p>Various actions are avael #1 ¢€ to assist student: who pre having dife@ulties. The actiuns hestgnet to cgrrfc) agm deficiencies include a mandatory study program ih “4hich students are assigned a certain number of hours to study on * weekly sasi£ based on their grades, some weak students are assigned weekend review packages containing additional homework questions to be answered and reviewed. In addition, students are assigned saturday morning makeup work if they have not devoted reasonable ; effort on their homework, weak students are assigned instructor assistance by their section advisor or an instructor for personalized help. There are mandatory extra instruction sessions weekly for poor students in every section,</p>
<p>If required, a student 1S given exam failure counselling. The instructors and section advisors review the student's examination to determine the reasons for his failure, including a check of his study habits and classroom notes. They then develop a corrective study program for the student,</p>
<p>If a student has continually failed exams he goes before an academ'c board. These academic boards give oral examinations to determ, ye a particular student's current level of knowledge and his potential to successfully complete the course, the board cah recommend retention on academic probation or that the student be dropped, depending on the knowledge the student shows at the</p>
<p>Complete records are maintained on each student's work ay nuclear power school. This includes all of the results gf his examinations, his progress and every personal counselling session he is given, {iis comment folder which contains summaries of all counselling sessions while at huclear power school 1S retained cor five years while his class standing and course average 15 maintained permanently on file,</p>
<p>At these prototypes, the navy personnel in training receive lectures and on-the-job instruction in the practical aspects of reactor plant operation, they operate all of the equipment associated with the reactor plant under the supervision of qualified instructors. Officers qualify as engl) zring officer of the watch. They must demonstrate a thorough kngwledge of all the reactor plant and steam plant systems &amp;S well as thes detailed operating criteria and procedures, and demonstrate the ability to perform operations on all watch stations in the prototype plant: they must demonstrate that they can take charge of the</p>
<p>Fniisted men qualtfy as gperators of equipment connected with their particular rating, this qualification consists of demonstrating general knowledge of all reactor plant systems and detailed knowledge of those associated with “their own rating, they must qualify on the watch stations they would normally stand aboard ship, and they must be able to handle normal maintenance problems on their equip=</p>
<p>| want to make it clear that this training 1S all carried out on an operating prototype propulsion plant. Noi on a reactor simulator. As fear as | AM concerned, you cannot take an inexperienced person and train him on a reactor simulator, every time he makes a mistake on a simulator, the instructor stops and merely moves some switch back to its proper position and then goes on, on a submarine if you make a mistake. The reactor could shut down when the ship is submerged. Je there 15 an enemy right there, you cannot come to the surface and regroup. [T 1S imperative that the type of training be geared to this increased level of res *cnsisility; you have to train people to react to the real sitlation at all times: but if they are trained with a simulator. They tend to expect there will be no consequences as a result of their actions, this simply won't work in real life,</p>
<p>Some companies havel tried to set ert the bustne.»s of building suni o2 simulators for US claiming st will allow US to train our people fast, then they can grant a cer- tificate that the navy people operated a simulator,</p>
<p>F would say that for anyone dealing with nuclear power, it I$ too complex a technology to have people just get an {dea how to operate a reactor by learning how to throw a few switches that can be immediately changed to correct an error, the fact that you will be operating a reactor in a ship in combat where peoples’ lives depend on your performance gives you an entirely different feeling about the importance of proper training,</p>
<p>I go out on the initial sea trials of every nuclear shrp, more than half the crew have never been to sea before, I AM talking about a brand new ship, yet I put them through their paces. 1 require them to exercise the shi? Nd the propulsion plant to its fullest, now, this is a new crew, and they must do all these things when they have had little or no experience at sea. They have no outsiders to advise them, and they must be able to operate the ship correctly for me to be satisfied, the only way they can do this is if they have been properly trained under circumstances identical to what they encounter</p>
<p>At sea. You cannot bdo this with simulators.</p>
<p>[Ntroduction to prototype training</p>
<p>Training at any one of the eight prototypes 1S con- ducted the same way, and is based on a four“phase program covering a 26 week training period. A classroom phase, transition phase, in-hull phase and paoricieency phase make up the basic prototype training plan,</p>
<p>The students are assigned to one of the prototypes upon completion of nuclear power schooll, when the class arrives, it starts classroom training which is premarily conducted in spaces outside the prototype hull, after five weeks, the student starts making the transition into the hull and he then begins watchstanding training under instruction, this 1S what prototype training is all about: to give the man in-hull experience operating the reactor plant, operating equipment very much like that he will se operating at sea, using procedures like those he will be using at sea. The major objective of prototype training 1S to make the best use of the training that is done in jhe hull within the constraints of reactor safety, at the conclusio&quot; of the watchstanding training under instruction. The man qualifies by passing written and oral exams, this allows him to stand the watch and to operate the equipment on his own--without the presence of an instructor, after</p>
<p>He stands “atches to gain prodictency as a watchstarder,</p>
<p>Second, with this four-phase program, two classes from nuclear power school can be accommodated at the plant at the same time, again, this makes for the best use of the prototype equipment. The time one class starts into watchstanding training coincides with the time the previous class qualified, and the time it ends watchstanding training coincides with the time the next class starts its watchstanding training,</p>
<p>In the classroom phase. The simdent spends 12 hours a day at the site, monday through fripay, during this time an officer gets about 7 hours a day of lectures and examinations, and an enlisted man about 6 hours per day, the remaining five to six hours is spent in study at the</p>
<p>You may ask why the student must get so much classroom instruction, since he has just finished nucuear power school. Ar nuclear power school he was taught the theoretical basis for the systems: for example, heat transfer and flutd flow, in teaching thtory at muciear power school, an sow submarine plant was used as the primary example as it 1S the must numerous of the various types of propulsion plants in use in the fleet, ay the prototype, the student. Must learn the systems of the specific plant (sin, for example, is the prototype of the NAUTILUS propulsion plant and alw 1S an aircraft carrier prototype) -to which</p>
<p>He 1S assigned rather than ssw systems, although the overall system layguts are similar on all the plants, the student must learn the details about the specific plant he will operate during his training at the prototype,</p>
<p>As he goes through these lectures, the student has study assignments to complete. We call these homework? But since all this is classified material. The student has to complete it at the site rather than at home, one part of these study assignments requires the student to get into the hull and trace out the plant systems~-hand over hand~-finding out what they look like and where they go.</p>
<p>Iw addition to the mechanical, electrical and reactor systems, the student gets chemistry and radiological controls lectures. The lectures in chemistry and radio- logical controls are not specific to each plant~-since these areas are common to all reactor plants, ihe officer student gets much more in this area than the enlisted student, this is because we do not train most enlisted - personnel to do much in chemistry and radiological controls,</p>
<p>Requirements hove been established on the reuse of questions from the examination bank in subsequent exams: there are also requirements on the types of questions that are used, for example. No true and false questions are allowed, essay questions and problems requiring calculations</p>
<p>Must make up at least 40% of the exam, finally, the exam questions and answers are reviewed annually for technical accuracy and content,</p>
<p>If a student fails an examination, he is assigned a remedial upgrading program tailored to his individual needs, staff advisors follow the student's progress daily to ensure that the remedial assignments are completed, student counseling is important to detect problems early before the trainee has fallen too far behind, each student receives periodic interviews from plant supervisors. Interviews are required at least every two weeks, upon any examination failure, or for generally low grades,</p>
<p>Prototype j kansuio% phase</p>
<p>The prototype transition phas! Starts at week six after completion of the classroom training. At the start of the transition phase, the students are divided into four groups and each group 18 assigned to a crew. [Hey go on an fight hour rotating shift schedule, so there is always one crew operating and training on the plant, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. After their eight hour shift as the crew in the hull. The students and staff work additional hours, the students continue to work at least 60 hours a week during this period,</p>
<p>In systems training. The student first learns the individual system and its components. Then the interrelationship between the systems ~~ how they affect or interface with each other -- and finally how to operate all of the individual systems as an integrated plant. The document that tells the student what he</p>
<p>Needs to know about a particular subject. And tells | he instructor ¢’ “at he should examine the student. Is called the qualification standard. The qualification standard contains a place for all the checkout signatures the student must get during his six month period at the prototype, these signatures verify that the student has completed a given portion of his training, eventually this becomes the legal record of the students qualification, only authorized instructors can give these signatures. And a system is used whereby certain signatures are embossed to guard against improper signing of the qualification record, examples of the type of knowledge required by the qualification standard for a system or component are “explain the functions of the system &quot;or. After having physically traced the system in the plant, &quot;draw a one-line sketch of the system from memory: using appropriate symbols and nomenclature and showing the items</p>
<p>Listed below.”</p>
<p>The second major type of training during transition phase 1S watchstanding. [0 qualify at the prototype. All students are required to stand a given minimum number of watches under the instruction of qualified staff watchstanders, during</p>
<p>These watches, the staff watchstander is responsible coun the watch station: however. He fulfills this responsibility by using the student to carry qut watchstanding duties.</p>
<p>The student is graded on each watch. And must receive a satisfactory grade or he does not get credit for the watch. The student 1S expected to significantly improve his watch~ standing capability as he gains experience of each watchstation. This factor 1S taken into account when assigning him a grade.</p>
<p>Duging the watch, there are prescribed things the student must do, such as starting up and shutting down a piece of</p>
<p>Equipment, these are called “practical factors, the student does these under instruction, with the staff instructor providing direct supervision. [He emphasis is on the student doing the operation himself. This is accomplished by first talking through the operation and then letting the student perform it, the staff instructor asks the student such things as: “how are you going to start up that pump?”;: “show me the procepure’; “discuss each step with me”: “what is the purpose</p>
<p>Step?&quot;: “what else in the plant will be affected by 11?” this sort of ques. “Ying is important because it allows the instructor to determine if the student understands why he</p>
<p>During watchstanding training, the student is also instructed on proper communications procedures and formality in communications, he 1S also instructed in logkeeping and</p>
<p>Other normal duties of a watchstander«</p>
<p>Other training conducted during the transition phase include lectures, seminars and training exercises. A series of lectures are given which are detailed and specific for each enlisted rating, and for the officers, these lectures are given on subjects where experience has shown that more emphasi§ is needed to get the message through to the student, this series is about 49 hours long. For officers it covers reactor plant instruments and control, electrical equipment</p>
<p>Two other types of training are started during transition phase! Seminars and training exercises, experience has shown that training in different forms is necessary to provide a sound basis for operation and for the kinds of engineering judgement that will be needed at sea, ' addition. Repetition and different forms of training are required to obtain adequate</p>
<p>A seminar 1S not a lecture. The idea of seminar training 1S to get the students involved. They must participate in an. Active manner, and show satisfactory knowledge, otherwise they do not receive credit for participating. We have made a strong effort to enforce the idea that a seminar is not a lecture, but more like a &quot;drill in the classroom,” these seminars are designed to get the student to think his way through a problem and reach a solution, as with all other training, there are written requirements for the conduct of seminars, for example, an approved seminar guide must be followed by the instructor. Who is called the seminar leader and who has been formally trained and qualified to conduct seminars. In addition, the number of students is restricted to seven, as this has been shown by experience to be the maximum number of participants for an effective seminar,</p>
<p>The othe? Type of training started during the transition phase is &quot;“tra:ning exercises.” these are sessions of one to four hours duration in which the student participates in training outside the hull, these are limited to groups of seven or eight students with an instructor, we have found that training exercises where there is much repetition is</p>
<p>Required for the students to become reasonably profici.nt 1h</p>
<p>All students participate in training exercises covering such things as damage control, where the student dons and takes off emergency breathing equipment, and use of fire fighting equipment. Also training is conducted in which the student demonstrates proper techniques for working with radiological controls. Each training exercise 1S conducted using a plan, eack is graded and must be satisfactorily passed +o get a signature. While he is at the prototype, the student will get seventeen training exercises totaling fifty-six hours. During transition phase he gets about twenty hours,</p>
<p>During transition phase it is important to carefully follow the progress of each student's training. Several methods are used to follow progress, first, considerable effort 1S exerted to plan and schedule the training. This becomes particularly important at the start of the transition phase, because of the many different fypes of training given. During this phase, the considerable self-study required. The individuals checkouts. And the watchstanding requirements,</p>
<p>Based on this nine month activity schedule. A detailed training events summary chart 1S developed. This summary is then broken down into weekly schedules for each crew, which are prepared and approved each week by the plant training manager, these weekly schedules list student and instructor assignments by name,</p>
<p>The plant evolutions are scheduled on a shift-by~shift basis for the week. In such a way as to phase in the operations and training needs. Watch bills are 1ssued for the staff instructors manning the watch. And a student watch bill is also issued for the trainees at those watch stations,</p>
<p>Finally» surveillance inspections and periodic agtcts are conducted to assure that the training program its being conducted as planned. [These audits get into every phase of the training by using a pre-selected audit plan, 1 will</p>
<p>rg 8)</p>
<p>The third phase of prototype training is the in~hull phase, early in the period, the student will finish his systems checkouts. By this time he will have spent about four hours learning and being checked out on each of about 60 systems,</p>
<p>Are actually assumed, the student stands a number of watches as an observer. To note what is going on, in some observer watches a separate staff instructor is assigned to provide more detailed training for the student, this is to accelerate the student's acquisition of knowledge before he actually stands the watch. Finally. The student assumes the training</p>
<p>Each watch is graded and the student must receive a satisfactory grade to get credit for the watch, a student must stand a specified minimum number of satisfactory watches in order to qualify. For example, for an officer student ten satisfactory watches are required at the engineering ufficer of the watch (eqqw) watch station. Most students stand more than the minimum number in order to become sufficiently proficient to pass the final evaluated watch,</p>
<p>Composed of three peoples one of my representatives from the local navaal reactors field office, a senlok representative of the plant management, and the staff engineering ufficer of the slatch on-watch instructor, this three man board 1S convened fok the purpose of observing the student's performance during this watch, each of the three board members independently grades the</p>
<p>] have certain operating philosophies that relate to student watchstanding: jhe plants are operated by detailed written procedures, strict compliance to these procedures I$ required and enforced, the shipboard plant operating manuals contain these procedures, a strong effort has been made te make the prototype manuals as much like those used on the ships as possible,</p>
<p>This is essential in the overall training of the student, he sees the same kinds of operating procedures, he uses the same kinds of equipment right down to the same torque wrench. For example? He !S trained to the same kinds gf qualification standards and usf the same text books as are used throughout the naval nuclear program, insofar as this is possible,</p>
<p>Board ship. $ require that the prototype plant be operated just as would a ship at sea, to the greatest extent possible. In this way, students get the actual live experience of knowing what to do when valves leak or equipment does not work, just as though it were happening at sea,</p>
<p>Uuring the in-hull period the student finishes the seminars and training exercises that are required for qualification, these seminars and training exercises involve more complex operations and casualties, |he student must show that he knows what is expected to occur during changing plant conditions, and that he can recognize the symptoms of casualties and take the proper corrective actions.</p>
<p>During this period, the student also participates in about 65 hours of discussions with a staff instructor during’ which he talks through various operating and casualty procedures. In general, these are the procedures which do not arise during watchstanding. If the student has already done any of those while he “°S on watch, he need not repeat them,</p>
<p>re eri Ear si i oS nek i</p>
<p>At end-of-card checkout the student is conducted by a staff instructor for two hours in each of six areas, by “end-of- card” | mean that the student has completed all of the required training in the qualification standard, these checkouts are done just prior to final oral boards. They cover mechanical, electrical, and reactor operations; the steam plant. The chemistry and radiological control areas, and integrated plant</p>
<p>Finally, during the in-hull watchstanding period, each student gets what is called a progress oral board when he I$ about 5u% and 804 of the way through qualification, these boards are one to 7wo hours long and are conducted in the same manner as a final qualification board,</p>
<p>Progress of the class and of each student is again carefully monitored during in-hull training. Here we look for how well he is progressing in his watchestanding, training areas, discussions, etc. If a student falls behind he wilt be assigned remedial programs,</p>
<p>“Kototype qualification criteria</p>
<p>Up to this point in the training program the student's progress has been measured almost entirely by written exam- inations. As he moves into the actual process of qualifying on the prototype reactor plant, the methods of measuring his knowledge and ability change. He is now required to demonstrate his performance by three different means: watchstanding ability. Knowledge as demonstrated on a comprehensive written examination, and knowledge demonstrated on an oral board, different people at the prototype are involved in making these evaluations. They are not based on an individual decision,</p>
<p>[He written comprehensive exam consists of questions selected so that each written examination is different, appi- tionally, the three members of the final oral board must unanimous ¢ agree that the individual is qualified,</p>
<p>This brings me to the meaning of qualification. It isa pass/fail grade for the student. If he passes it means that</p>
<p>The plant staff, both navy and the contractor. Ar aelling to let him stand the watch on fis own. It means that the plant manager is willing to assume responsibility for safety of the plant when it is being operated by this qualified student, the contractor is thus saying that from a reactor safety viewpoint he is willing to let the man operate the plant. If the contractor can not say this, then obviously we should not let him go on to operate a submarine or surface ship in the</p>
<p>Second, for officer students. A final evaluated watch must be passed. [This is bone by a board of three members as noted previously. Lf the student fails this watch, he completes remedial training and tries again, after being upgraded in his weak areas. Typically, he will not be given more than two to three chances before a decision is made on whether he should be</p>
<p>Disenrolled, /3</p>
<p>Third, the student must pass a final comprehensive written examination, {hese are drawn from an examination bank and cover each of the areas of mechanical, electrical, reactor, chemistry, radiological controls, and the overall plant, the exam is four hours in length for enlisted personnel and eight hours for officers. Jhese examinations are graded and reviewed with the student prior to his final oral board. If the student. Fails in any area, he 1S reexamined after an upgrading program, if he fails a reexamination. He will normally be disenrolled from the school.</p>
<p>Members of the oral board are alerted to the student’s weak areas by having reviewed his record. Jhey can therefore probe areas n sufficient depth. Only specific personnel are authorized to participate as board members, for officer students, for example, the final board is composed of fqur members: a member of the contractor plant management: a member of my naval reactors field office staff or the nuclear</p>
<p>Pow training unit staff; a commissioned officer from the plant staff: and an engineering officer of the watch, a failing grade assigned in any area by any board member causes the student to fail the board.</p>
<p>In the event of failure, he will be given a re-board after remedial training. For the re-board, the members required are higher level managers, for example, for the re~board of an officer student, usually the plant manager, one of my repre- sentatives from the local naval reactors field office. The commanding officer of the nuclear power training unit and another commissioned officer will be the board members, if a student fails his second board, he will usually be disenrolled, in some cases | may approve a third board.</p>
<p>The oral boards are conducted formally. There is a chairman of the board, [the board examines the student's record. (Ach member ask questions. All members grade the answer.</p>
<p>Once he has qualified. The student enters the fourth and last phase of training at the prototype, [his is the</p>
<p>Proficiency phase. Jhe primary purpose of this phase is to</p>
<p>Blcome profici':.; as a watchstander, in this phase the student gets watchstanding experience as the man on watch at the station, he takes the watch by himself, and there 1§ no staff watch stander present to help him, .</p>
<p>Lectures are also scheduled to increase the student's knowledge in various areas, in addition the qualified student has an opportunity to participate in various maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>For this part of the program, the lectures and tasks are scheduled on a case basis, the object is to give students as much additional training as we can while he is gaining watch- standing experience, -obvrously, not all students get the same amount of proficiency training. Since they qualify at different</p>
<p>The entire class graduates at the same time and are transferred tu the fleet. A small number of those who have demonstrated above average performance at the nuclear power school and te: prototype are retained on the staff to qualify</p>
<p>Control of [ht protolypl 12alming program</p>
<p>The primary control of prototype training program is the prototype training manual. Both bettis and kapl labora~ tories participated in preparation of this document before naval reactors approved and issued it, jhes administrative manual, covers all the basic requirements for running the program. It ranges from the organization and titles of people involved, to detailed descriptions of how the program is conducted. It covers preparation and control of all the materials used: including, for example. What must be in a lesson plan, how it 1S organized, who approves it, and so on, [t covers the primary academic standards and policies.</p>
<p>Based on the naval reactors prototype training manual. Approved local prototype [raining manuals have been developed for each prototype site. This allows some flexibility to take account of site differences. However, any significant deviation requires the approval of naval reactors.</p>
<p>As in the case of the nuclear power school, complete and detailed records are kept on each student for all of his work at the prototypes. Sample examinations used for qualification. His qualification standard, results of oral examinations. And</p>
<p>H1s counselling records, are ali maintained for five years while a summary of his record is maintained for 20 years. As an example. Of the records maintained, each student must obtain some one thousand instructor signatures attesting to being watchstation qualification throughout his six months training at the prototype, these records are retained for five years as part of the student's record,</p>
<p>] have descussed qualification standards, which are local documents issued by each prototype plant. [These standards are based upon qualification guides which are also approved by naval reactors for use at all prototypes, jhe local standard is exactly the same as the naval reactors guides except for deviations to allow for a given plant's design differences. Any deviations from the naval reactors issued guide requires .</p>
<p>Naval reactors approval.</p>
<p>p vPE IN</p>
<p>The prototype sites are operated by a contractor site manager, and the individual prototype plants are supervised by a contractor plant manacer. He has training, maintenance, and administrative groups under him that operate and maintain the plants, and train the students, these groups are a mixture of</p>
<p>Civilian and navy personnel. The windsor, connecticut site 1S slightly different in that there is no civiltan plant manager, [jhe prototype is operated by the navy with a naval gfeficer in charge who has had command of a nuclear ship.</p>
<p>As | have mentioned, the prototype plants are operated on a four crew basis around the clock. Both navy and contractor personnel are assigned to crew and staff watches. The contractor surry supervisor on each crew is the on~shift senior contractor watch, and supervises overall operation of the plant, again, the windsor organization has a naval officer in a similar capacity,</p>
<p>| have mentioned the nuclear power training unit (nptu), this ts the navy military organization at each prototype site that militarily controls the naval personnel, the commanding officer of the siptu has previously served as the commanding officer of a nuclear powered ship. He is responsible for the melttary performance of the navy personnel at the site. He 1S also responsible to me to see that training 1S being properly |</p>
<p>In the case of the windsor prototype, the commanding orricer, npiu 1s also commanding officer of the prototype for operating the plant, a contractor organization is there with aa site manager, but the civilian organization does not operate — the plant, both tke commanding officer of each nptu and his</p>
<p>Extcuurive off ick monitor the plant. Act as members of various qualification boards, and conduct watchstanding evaluations of officers,</p>
<p>[He selection of naval officers for assignment to the prototype staff 1S made by the chief of naval personnel with the assistance of my staff at navaal reactors. Because of the operational nature of their assignment at the rrototype,</p>
<p>Heavy weight in selection is given to the officer's performance in the fleet. Jhe officer should have stood in the upper fifty percent of his nuclear power school and prototype classes. An exception to this is sometimes made based on above average performance in attaining engineer officer qualification as well 5 outstanding fleet performance, similar criteria are applied to selection of enlisted staff instructors. We also place heavy weight on their demonstrated performance on a nuclear</p>
<p>The best staff instructors are eventually assigned as classroom instructors, they qualify by giving “dry run” lectures to senior personnel. Ihf first time they give the classroom lecture, they are monitored 1u0% of the time and are cretiqued by senior instructors gr management personnel. Iht. Civilian contractor personnel who are involved in the opfration of the plant qualify tf) the same standards as officers. They also must go through a training program in</p>
<p>The contractor want [1 70 be run,</p>
<p>Lhis '\volves routine and special audits by contractor management. By the navi reactors field office, and by the navy nuctear power training unit. In some cases the auditors stand watches for expended period of time in-hull or in training areas to learn what is going on in depth,</p>
<p>Finally there are periodic audits by the contractor laboratories and by naval reactors headquarters personnel,</p>
<p>[ require my navat reactors fiecp office personnel, certain civilian contractor managers, plant performance evaluation activity personnel, and the senior naval officer assigned to the prototypes jo write me weekly and advise me of problems they have observed in any area. And what corrective action 15 being taken, many of these letters address. Training issues and provide me a good insight as to how training is being conducted. Members of my staff at naval reactors in washington periodically visit the nuclear power school and the prototypes and report to me..in writing, their observations</p>
<p>Here is assigned, at each naval reactors field office, a sea-experienced nuclear trained officer whose primary function is to review all aspects of the training program at that site. He conducts frequent and detailed audits, he also reports in writing to me each week,</p>
<p>As 1S evidenced from what | have said, during the periods of formal academic instruction at nuclear power school and prototype training, a process of weeding out those personnel not suitable to become nuclear plant operators takes place, only those officers and enlisted men who have demonstrated that they have the academic and practical abilities required of a safe and competent operator are graduated from the training program, [| consider this process essential to insure that only thgse who have proved themselves to be safe and competent operators are assigned to nuclear~powered ships, in this way | attempt to maintain uniform high standards throughout the program. You should note that. Even with the careful selection of personnel | have described. And a training program that involves a significant amgunt of counseling. The academic failure rate over the one year coufse :5 arbgut twelve per cent for officers and about twenty per cent for enlisted: personnel.</p>
<p>Once the officer or enlisted man has satisfactorily completed nuclear powwer school and prototype training he 1S considered</p>
<p>To be “nuclear qualified&quot;. In the case of an officer, he is</p>
<p>These nuclear designators. Both for officer and enlisted personnel, are assigned by the chief of naval personnel based on naval reactors recommendation, removal of an officers nuclear designator can only be done with my approval, removal of enlisted nuclear designation requires naval reactors</p>
<p>All personnel who operate any equipment directly associated with the nuclear propulsion plant aboard ship must have recelved the onf year course, including the formal academic training and the operational training at one of the prototypes, this requirement [S explicitly stated in the navy’s instruction on operation of nuclear-powered ships, this states</p>
<p>Following completion of training at a prototype, the newly qualified officer or enlisted personnel is assigned to billets in nuclear-powered ships, [hey then learn the systems and procedures pertaining to their particular ship, the enlisted personnel complete qualification on all watch stations pertinent to their rating, and the officers qualify as engineering officers of the natch on the nuclear propulsion plant of that suip. The qualification program in each ship is actually a continuous training and retraining process, I will now describe how this fleet nuclear propulsion plant training is. Conducted.</p>
<p>Ufficer and enlisted personnel reporting to the fleet arrive with a solid background in the principles of operation of a nuclear propullion plant. They have also learned “how to eualiey,” the shipboard qualification program consists of basic engineering qualification (beq) and individual watchstation qualteication. Basic enginelring qualification provides a cross</p>
<p>Rate backgrsj.2 level of knowledge for all nuclear trained personnel, and allows the operator to build on the principles learned at the nuclear power school and the prototype, tuis qualification consists of various nuclear propulsion plant knowledge requirements including subjects such as reactor theory. Systems design, principles of operating and casualty procedures, engineering department organization, radiological controls and chemrstry, in most cases beq will be pursued concurrently with initial watch qualification and some portions are prerequisites for each watchstation, advanced watch qualifications such as reactor operator require completion of beq in its entirety,</p>
<p>The shipboard program of watch qualification for officer and enlisted personnel varies from that at the prototype in that it is less rigidly structured. The individual is expected fo complete practical factors and training watch requirements concurrent with study and checkout on shipboard propulsion plant systems. Since he has just completed prototype qualificavign this is not an unreasonable expectation,</p>
<p>Each officer, upon reporting 7c his first nuclear ship, must qualify as engineering off ictrr of the watcn (eqow), he completes basic engineering qualteication and selected theoretical and practical portions of enlisted watch stander</p>
<p>Qual tfacation requirements as prerequisites tg the advanced requirements for eqow, jit usually takes three to six months to complete this qualification depending on the ability of the officer. The ship’s operating schedule and the similarity of the shipboard plant with that of the prototype the</p>
<p>The first step in shipboard qualification for an enlisted operator 1S to qualify rapidly on an in-rate watchstation so that he may become a useful member of the crew. The length of time required will vary depending on the watchstation, and the additional factors previously mentioned as affecting officer qualification rate. For example, an engineering laboratory technictan (elt) may be able to qualify as a shipboard elt in only a few days because shipboard radiological controls and chemistry equipment, procedures, and associated systems are very similak to those at all prototypes. Bur 17 will usually take several weeks or months for him to qualify at other</p>
<p>The submarine and surface ship force commanders have promulgated recommended qualificai1/on paths fork each rate and have provided guidelines indicating the approximate length of time the average individual 15 explcted to complete each watch qualification, experience has shown that many operators</p>
<p>Wili. Qualify in less time than the guideline period while a</p>
<p>Few will ey. Id it, ultimately each enlisted man is required to qualify on his most advanced in-rate watchstation and, upon - gaining appropriate seniority and experience, to qualify as engineering watch supervisor (ews), the most senior enlisted watch.</p>
<p>The mechanics of shipboard watch qualification are similar to those already described and in use at the prototypes, the operator must study the system or other subject, physically trace out the system, locate components and, finally, receive a checkout with satisfactory knowledge level indicated by a signature on his qualification card which is similar in purpcse to the pee -otype qualification standard, he must complete practical factors and demonstrate satisfactory ability tou handle his watchstation during training watches, final comprehensive oral and written examinations complete this</p>
<p>To assure safe and rel{abl! Propulsion plant operation. | have, through the chief of naval operations, established high standards and require that these standards be mainta: ned within the shipboard qualification program, [he standards that are to be observed are spelled out in the engineering department manuaat. For naval nuc ear propulsion plants. And in qualification guides for nucicaar propulsion plant watchstanders. These publications are prepared by naval reactors and form the basis for development of shipboard qualification requirements, quality control of the qualification program is maintained by formally stated requirements. Personnel who are authorized to certify completion of the various qualification requirements are designated in writing and must demonstrate that they possess the requisite knowledge level to be a qualification petty officer. The engineering department manual defines who may approve the written examinations to be given for each watchstation and also specifies who has the authority to certify final qualification. For example. The commanding officer is persunally required to certify the final qualification of all reacton operators, as well as certain other watchstanders. The pnd product of the system | have described 1S a tralned nuclear propulsion plant watchstander who understands how the</p>
<p>Continuing [raining program</p>
<p>Shipboard nuclear propulsion plant training is not limited to the watch qualification program, a continuous shipboard training program is a high priority program consisting of maintenance of watchstanding proficiency, watchstander ‘ requalification, and what | will call “recurring training, ”</p>
<p>Maintenance of watchstanding proficiency _</p>
<p>An operator can be considered proficient on a(given watchstation only if he stands watch at a prescribed frequency on that watchstation. In the naval nuclear program we define this requirement and maintain records so that we can be’ sure when we assign an operator to a watch station that he has &quot;maintained his proficiency” on that watchstation, for example, I require an engineering officer of the watch to stand at least two-four hour watches each month to maintain proficiency, if a watchstander does not meet these requirements his name is removed from the list of qualitfieu watchstanders and he is required to complete spectal training sfecified by the ship’ 3 engineer officer before he can be returned to the list of</p>
<p>Yj</p>
<p>Recurring | raleling</p>
<p>A major portion of training time is’ spent on &quot;recurring training”. There is a continuing need to reinforce initial training and provide training which increases the level of knowledge of all nuclear operators. 1 want to make it clear that, in order to maintain high standards in the navy nuclear propulsion program, ships commanding officers must conduct recurring training, this training is also a vehicle for improving the watchstander’s ability to handle casualties, and supports | more advanced watch qualification,</p>
<p>The methods used in conducting nuclear propulsion plant recurring training in ships are the same proven ways of accomplishing training | have described and are in use at nucleak power school and prototypes. Lectures and seminars are conducted on a departmental and divisional basis, in most cases a monitor, senior to the instructor or seminar leader is present to assist in keeping the training session “on track”, and to provide feedback 1’ the command and the instructor on the quality of the lecture or seminar, lectures are given by experienced personne!. Who are specifically selected to fit the topic and audience, selection of instructors, lecturers and monitors is an-</p>
<p>In addition to classroom type training, the recurring training program 15 also composed of practical. Evolutions and casualty drills, these form an important part of the shipboard training plan, allowing the nuclear propulsion plant operator to build on his theoretical knowledge of the propulsion plant and put into practice the principles of operating and casualty procedures he has studied, the engineering department manuat. For naval nuclear peopulston plants lists the required drills and evolutions and indicates whether the drill should be walked through or actually conducted. In some cases, part of the casualty action may be walked-through and part actually carried out, within the constraints of reactor and ship safety, a conscious effort</p>
<p>Poorly conducted casualty driil training, which allows improper actions to uccur without {dentification and correction, stmply reinforces the wrong way to 0 things in the propulsion plant. [In lfeflct, we could train ourselves to operate the plant [in an unsatisfactory fashion, io avgiq this ] insist that</p>
<p>] will describe some of the considerations that are involved in the conduct of casualty drills on a nuclear ship. First, a drill guide 1S prepared which describes the drill, how it will be initiated, what is to be accomplished, specifies safety monitors and observers, etc. Various propulsion plant reference material and the engineering department manual are used. The engineer officer then submits this drill guide to the ship’s commanding officer for his approval, a file of these approved drill guides is maintained for recurring use, jhe commanding mfficer must approve the actual conduct of each drill even though he has previously approved the basic drill guide, sometimes the watch section scheduled for a particular drill will be notified well in advance of the nature of the drill in order that specific training, such as a review of the appropriate casualty procedures, may be accomplished. This may be appropriate where the section will be doing a difficult drill for the first time or where the ship has just completed a lengthly period with the plant</p>
<p>Drell monitors and safety observers must be fully aware of what is expected of them and the limits to their responsibilities, [this 1S accomplished at a briefing attended by ali. Monitors and safety observers and normally led by the engineering officer, | consider it appropriate that the ship's commanpiing officer or executive officer re present at these</p>
<p>Conduct of casualty drills is important, but safety considerations dictate that some casualties should not actually be done for training. | therefore, we use techniques for presenting the symptoms of these casualties in a manner that will, as nearly as practicable, appeal to the same senses that the watchstander would normally use in</p>
<p>The actual casualty drill may be pre~announced or may be a surprise to the watch section. Jhe engineer officer will normally make this determination. Some combination of both methods ts appropriate to ensure that the watchstanders can properly handle unexpected plant casualties. During drills, montipors correct watchstander errors on the spot, where failure 10 dg sq would reinforce improper actions, safety monitors are otattoned to prevent incorrect watchstander action which could hazart) the reactor plant. Odrills are allowed to progress long enough to evaluate the section’s ability to restore the plant to lis normal condition. Obviously there are practical limits to</p>
<p>Carry out the ian itial casualty actions and a second section will recover the plant back to a normal condition, upon completion of the drill, a critique involving all drill monitors is immediately held to collect comments, determine where errors were made and evaluate the overall conduct of the drill. Appropriate reference material such as the operating manuals for the ships propulsion plant are essential at this session to accurately assess all</p>
<p>Or the casualty actions taken,</p>
<p>After the engineer officer has assembled the significant comments from the monitor critique he conducts a critique of the drill for the watch section after they come off watch, if training lessons are to be learned that would benefit other engineering department personnel, the engineer. Officer will cause this information to be disseminated, finally, where drill deficiencies show weaknesses in the ship’s fundamental training program, corrective measures are taken to upgrade these areas, similiar requirements for maintaining watchstanding proficiency and conducting continuing training are also established at the</p>
<p>Department personnel are present for the entire propulsion 9b</p>
<p>Plant test program. Two-thirds of the nuclear-trained personnel for the new crew are required to have served on an operating nuclear-powered ship and be qualified on the propulsion plant of that ship, engineering personnel receive classroom lectures conducted by the experienced ship’s engineering personnel. Shipyard personnel, and manufacturers’ representatives, all personnel must complete initial shipboard watchstander qualification or requalify under procedures similar to those</p>
<p>For initial qualification. In the case of operators who have previously qualified in another ship. The crew gains practical operating experience aboard ship py participating directly im the testing of the propulsion plant, beginning with extensive tests before the reactor core is installed. In the case of certain new design ships, special short courses for the new construction nucleus crews are taught at the prototype plant or the appro- priate naval reactors laeoratofy. This better prepares the nuclear trained personnel for operation of the propulsion plant during the initial test program. The ship’s crew operates the fquipment during the test program. Under the surveillance of qualified engineers and scientists including representatives</p>
<p>Training of nuclear propulsion plant operators on ships undergoing overhaul is accomplished using the same methods as for operating ships, there are some minor differences in that there is less opportunity for practical training, and some special training sessions may be conducted by contractor or shipyard personnel. As | have mentioned, all watchstanders must. Requalify under procedures similar to those for initial qualification,</p>
<p>TR du</p>
<p>In addition to the one year course of instruction and subsequent shipboard qualification already described, those officers who are assigned as engineer officer of nuclear-powered ships are formally examined and qualified, each nuclear trained junior officer is expected to complete this qualificatpon prior to the end of his first or, in the case of surface ship officers, second sh'pboard tour of duty. This program involves preparation by the candi: \te, on board his ship, and final approval by me after ne successfully completes a comprehensive written and oral pxamination administered over a two day period at naval reactors in washington, ;</p>
<p>Have the recommendation of his commanding officer. When so recommended, the candidate will be ordered by the chief of naval personnel to report to naval reactors for two days to be examined for qualification as engineer officer, the first day the officer will take a seven and one“half hour written examination consisting of five sections covering reactor theory, radiological controls and chemistry, fluid systems, electrical systems and overall</p>
<p>| xamination, one reexamination is usually allowed. The officer I$ required to complete both an oral and written reexamiantion in</p>
<p>Clearly, the one person having the greatest overall responsibility for the safe operation of the nuclear propulsion plant is the ship’s commanding officer, therefore, it should not be surprising that each prospective commanding officer is required to attend a course of instruction at naval reactors and satisfactorily complete this course prior to reporting to a ship as commanding officer,</p>
<p>In the early years of the program, senior sea-experienced officers were selected as commanding officers of the first nuclear-powered ships. These prospective commanding officers received the same type of training that other officers in nuclear ships received. However, the academic instruction was given by members on the navat reactors staff at headquarters in washington, in addition to formal classroom training, the prospective commanding officers received added material on those subjects apelcting the testing and operation of nuclear-powered ships which they nee’ =d to know by reason of their responsibilities as commanding officers. Operational training of prospective commanding officers consisted of approximately eight weeks of concentrated instruction and qualification on all engineering watch stations at one of the naval reactors prototypes,</p>
<p>Conce l3g. Prospective commanding officers of all nuclear- powered. Submarines have had previous duty on board a nuclear-poweked ship. And have therefore undergone training at one of the naval nuclear power schools and at a prototype upon initial entry into the nuclear power program. Upon selection as a commanding officer. The prospective commanding officer reports to navat reactors for a thirteen week course, this course 1S a concentrated training period covering the nuclear propulsion plant of the ship to which the officer 1S scheduled for assignment as commanding officer. Subjects covered include mechanical, fluid and electrical (including control and instrumentation) systems, plant materials, reactor engineering, reactor theory, reactor safety and chemistry and radiological controls. The prospective commanding officer is examined in all areas and must pass each one, two oral examinations are also given covering course material. A final comprehensive wretten examination of similar length and composition to the peasprerive engineer officer examination ts administered, and the prospecrivi. Commanding officer must pass all sections of this examlnation, in addition, a final oral examination on reactor safety 18 given by a four member naval reactors board. Special. Briefings by senior naval officers and training in subjects {hat will aid the prospective commanding officer in running his ship</p>
<p>I have directed that certain other training be conducted when it is required to meet an identified specific need. For example, two years ago it came to my attention that electronics technicians were severely lacking in the knowledge and skills to properly conduct maintenance on the electronic equipment associated with the nuclear propulsion plant, I directed the establishment of a five week course at the prototype sites in idaho and new york to teach the necessary electronics repair techniques,</p>
<p>As I have metioned, special design courses are taught for the nucleus crews of some new design ships, for example, we teach a seven week design course at west micton, new york for ihe nuclear trained crew members of TRIDENT submarines,</p>
<p>Aircrart carrier prospective executive officers and reactor officers are required to attend the prospective commanding officers corvse at naval reactors, and certain force commander staff personnel attend the chemistry and radiological controls section of that course. In addition, members of my staff at the various field offices who monitor prototype, shipyard and ship performance are required to demonstrate by examination that they</p>
<p>Throughout my comments, | have indicated various points where a measure of quality control is exercised in the training program, I will now review and further discuss the key means by which we control the standards of our shipboard training, monitors are used both in the lecture and seminar area and in casualty drills, officer and enlisted personnel are used as monitors, with the principal criteria for selection being the individuals's knowledge of the area he is to monitor, frequent examinations are used, not just to confirm an adequate level of knowledge but to increase knowledge as well. The nuclear trained personnel on the staffs of the ship’s immediate superiors in the chain of command (for example, squadron or force commander) routinely review shiphoard training for its effectiveness. Often this requires that staff personnel go to sea and actually observe the training being conducted, the pre-criticality reactor safeguards examination conducted by my staff on ships with new reactor cores provide a direct evaluation of the state of the crews training,</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the examination the team leader reports to me directly with a pass or fail recommendation. I personall“? Approve all results of these examinations. This inspection, called a reactor safeguards examination, occurs about four to six weeks prior to initial criticality of the reactor, immediately prior to initial criticality, the shipyard commander</p>
<p>Or the supervisor of shipbuilding, as appropriate, requests permission by naval message to conduct operations with the reactor at power, ] personally authorize initial criticality and subsequent testing with the reactor at power.</p>
<p>The procedure | have just described is also used in the case of a land-based prototype with a new reactor core.</p>
<p>Following this initial safeguards examination, each crew is examined annually, in the past these annual examinations have been conducted by senior members of my staff. On march 13, | 1967, the chief of naval operations established navaal nuclear propulsion examining boards on the staffs of the commander-in- chrer atlantic and pacific fleets.</p>
<p>The fueet nuclear propulsion examining boards provide an outside. Independent evaluation of shipboard training. Along with other facets of propulsion plant operations. Administration, and maintenance. These boards are headet by a senior captain who has served as commanding officer of a naval nuclear-powered ship. The atlantic fleet nuclear propulsion examining board is composed of sufficient officers to conduct operational reactor safeguards examinations on three ships simultaneously. The pactfic fleet board is</p>
<p>A year of nuclear-powered ships operating at sea as well as radiological support facilities on support ships and shore bases. These examinations last from two to five days and look into every aspect of nuclear propulsion plant or radiological support facility operations, administration, and training. Casualty drills and evolutions are conducted for the boarp to: evaluate. Operators are interviewed by board members to determine their level of knowledge, additionally, the board conducts a detailed inspection of engineering or radiological support facility spaces to determine adequacy of material conditions and cleanliness, upon completion of the examinatioi a grade is assigned and a trend is determined relative to th&quot; ship's previous performance,</p>
<p>The ships operational commander. The chrer of naval operations and to me. Ships that have significant weak areas are required to submit a written report of corrective action within a specified period following the examinations, examination reports are used to upgrade the performance and training of the crews of all nuclear-powered ships and radiological support facilities: and» when necessary. To initiate changes in the overall training program including nuclear power school and prototype training.</p>
<p>] discuss the results of the examination with each commanding officer by phone - because for most part they are ‘in various parts of the world. Ic | consider it necessary, I ask him to write me and tell me what he will do to improve</p>
<p>Personnel from my staff conduct annual examinations at the land-based prototypes« a written report of corrective action is required in all cases within a specified period following the examination. Again. These safeguards examinations reports provide feedback useful in improving the training</p>
<p>To ensure that | AM kept fully aware of problems associated with naval nuclear powered plants (both ship and prototype), I require the commanding officer or prototype managers to report to me directly any equipment malfunction, operational difficulty, or deviation from prescribed procedures, . These written “incident reports” are in addition to other formal navy requirements and are uniquely designed to satisfy the technical requirements of nuclear power, they describe in detail what has happened, why it happened, and what has already been done locally to correct the problem and rrevent a recurrence. 1 read every report and ensure that adequate — corrective action is taken in each case. My staff reviews each report in depth in their particular area of interes™. They also monitor for trends indicative of a problem common to several plants or common only to one type of plant.</p>
<p>This rapid feedback of design. Material, personnel, or procedural problems has proven invaluable in improving the reliabili™’. Safety and performance, both of the equipfent and | of the operators, many times apparently inconsequential failures. When investigated fully, have lead to actions which. - prevented more serious incidents from occurring, |</p>
<p>Er ribl cases wherit, hal thik individual een better traened. He might have avoided an error in the performance of his job. Lessons learned from these reports are periodically promulgated to the fleet in naval reactorrs technical bulletin articles.</p>
<p>| previously indicated the importance of inspections in regard to maintaining high standards. These inspections come in many ways and forms but one of the most effective is the monitor watch. The monitor watch is a surveillance conducted by someone. Knowledgeable in a given area, to. Observe and detect deficiencies in performance that occur during the period of observation, experience has shown that these monitor watches should be at least two hours in length so that the inspector becomes part of the background and the crew performs</p>
<p>S they would without a monitor present, | require my</p>
<p>Representatives in the field (shipyards and prototypes) to conduct monitor watches periodically particularly during the night, and report the results directly to me. The force commanders have a similar monitor watch system in which nuclear trained staff members conduct monitor watches on the ships assigned to their command, | receive copies of the monitor watch reports that are submitted under the force</p>
<p>I require every commanding officer of a nuclear powered ship to write a periodic personal letter to me discussing propulsion plant problems, included in this letter is a listing of all recurring nuclear propulsion plant training the commanding officer has conducted on his ship since his last letter.
