      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1958 speech, Admiral H.G. Rickover discusses the profound significance of the USS *Nautilus&#x27;* transpolar voyage, describing it as an epic achievement that fulfilled a long-standing U.S. Navy goal for Arctic exploration, dating back to Lt. George W. DeLong&#x27;s 1879 *Jeanette* expedition. While celebrating the *Nautilus&#x27;* technological marvel—operating at over 20 knots under the icecap—Rickover delivers a stark warning: nuclear propulsion has removed the Arctic&#x27;s protective barrier, transforming it into a new, accessible military theater. He highlights the alarming threat posed by the Soviet Union&#x27;s massive submarine fleet, which numbered approximately 450 against the U.S.&#x27;s 110, having built 350 new subs since WWII compared to the U.S.&#x27;s 21, and possessing a force ten times larger than Germany&#x27;s at the start of WWII. Despite the U.S.&#x27;s current lead in nuclear submarine technology (with 5 operating and 28 authorized, including the faster *Skipjack*, larger *Triton*, and the *Skate* which replicated the *Nautilus&#x27;* feat), and the development of POLARIS missile capabilities and future nuclear surface fleets by 1961, Rickover stresses that the *Nautilus* represents a &quot;beginning,&quot; not an end. He issues an urgent call for intensified efforts to rapidly build nuclear naval assets, asserting that &quot;Our survival as a nation may depend upon it&quot; to maintain freedom of the seas against this formidable and rapidly advancing adversary.</p>

<p>THE MEANING OF THE NAUTILUS? POLAR VOYAGE</p>
<p>The reaction of the world to the epic journey of the NAUTILUS across the<br>Arctic Sea and under the North Pole far Surpassed the imaginations of all of<br>us who have been closely associated with the development of this fine ship.<br>The name of the NAUTILUS and its intrepid skipper, Commander Anderson, will<br>have a secure place on the roster of naval ships and heroes who have explored<br>the Arctic. To reach the North Pole by sea has long been a goal of the U. So<br>Navy. As long ago as 1879 Lt. George W. Defong, in command of the JEANETTE,<br>left the Navy yard at Mare Island, California, on an expedition to the North<br>Pole. The voyage was ill-fated and but few survivors returned after three<br>long years of incredible hardship. Many expeditions followed; few succeeded,<br>The statement that &quot;The Arctic Ocean has been for years the nursery of heroic<br>deeds&quot; could well have been the motto of our Navy&#x27;s long efforts to conquer</p>
<p>the Arctic.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in adventure and exploration, the journey of</p>
<p>the NAUTILUS and of her heroic crew will always remain one of the great naval<br>achievements of our time. To the scientific-minded, the complex nuclear pro-<br>pulsion plant of the NAUTILUS and the many novel and ingenious navigational<br>devices which guided her safely through unknown waters will prove endlessly<br>exciting. All thoughtful persons will contemplate this Arctic journey with<br>mixed feelings. Proud as we have a right to be that an American ship was the<br>first to cross the Pole, we cannot escape a sense of sober concern if not of<br>anxiety. With this voyage, another protective shield has disappeared to leave<br>an already insecure and apprehensive world still more exposed to sudden attack.<br>Steaming at speeds in excess of 20 knots through the dark seas below the<br>polar icecap, the NAUTILUS has in one bold step opened a new frontier. Science<br>and engineering, by creating nuclear propulsion, have demolished the tradi-<br>tional fortress-—like protection of the polar icecap which had heretofore<br>shielded the lands bordering on the Arctic, No longer is the Arctic Ocean<br>with its thick roof of ice, inscrutable to man&#x27;s curiosity. It will now be<br>exploited both for commercial interests and for military and naval purposes.<br>Everyone who lives in lands bordering the Arctic seas knows that these areas<br>have now become accessible not only from the air but from the sea as well.<br>Obviously, the Arctic waters will be accessible only to those nations who<br>possess muclear powered submarines. Any one of these nations may decide some<br>day to turn these frozen seas into the next military theater. Modern technol-<br>ogy has thus brought another once-distant part of the globe into the center of</p>
<p>world politics.</p>
<p>The transpolar voyage of the NAUTILUS was not only a realization of<br>dreams long held by many men, but it also marked completion of the final test<br>of the NAUTILUS, three and a half years after she first went to sea in January<br>1955. The NAUTILUS has operated more intensively than any other new naval<br>ship in history. Time after time, in operation after operation, she has dem-<br>onstrated that she is not just another submarine but an entirely new weapon<br>system whose features we are only beginning to understand and exploit. Freedom<br>from the earth&#x27;s atmosphere with practically unlimited endurance at high<br>speeds which is characteristic of mclear propulsion permits her, as now<br>surely demonstrated, to go anywhere, at any time. This voyage has shown that<br>the mclear submarine has matured as a naval weapon.</p>
<p>Many new naval weapon systems are presently being developed. These sys—<br>tems combined with nuclear propulsion and its unprecedented mobility will make<br>our submarines capable of taking on heretofore undreamed of missions. The<br>primary mission, however, of the U. S. Navy is to maintain freedom of the<br>seas. The major threat to our ability to maintain this freedom lies with the<br>Soviet Navy which is the second largest in the world. The Soviets have con-<br>centrated on submarines. They have about 450 against our 110. Since World<br>War II the Russians have built 350 submarines to our 21. At the outbreak of<br>World War II Germany had but 57 submarines and of these only 22 were ocean-<br>going. Before the German submarine fleet could be demolished 40 thousand men<br>lost their lives and 14 million tons of Allied shipping sank to the bottom of<br>the seas. It should be a sobering thought to all of us that the Russian sub-<br>marine fleet is now ten times as large as was the German submarine force at<br>the beginning of World War II. The Soviets have more submarines today than<br>the Germans had at any single time during that war.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Fortunately we are,at the moment, ahead of the Soviets in the development<br>of the mclear powered submarine. And, it is by far the best antisubmarine<br>weapon we have today. We mist make certain that we remain ahead with this<br>antisubmarine weapon system and that we build a sufficient number of these<br>attack submarines to combat the Soviet submarine menace.</p>
<p>Too often we think of the submarine merely in terms of a ship lying in<br>wait in the depths of the ocean to sink merchant shipping crossing its path.<br>Postwar developments have changed this and have given the submarine new capa~<br>bilities and new missions. It is common knowledge that the Soviets can now<br>launch from their submarines missiles with ranges of at least 200 miles. It<br>would take but a single such missile accurately placed to cripple any one of<br>our seaboard cities. Before too long wineiles from submarines will reach any<br>target in the U. S. The best protection of our shores against missile-firing<br>enemy submarines is in setting up submerged barriers of our own nuclear powered<br>attack submarines which can destroy enemy submarines menacing our coasts. :</p>
<p>We too are developing missile-firing submarines capable not only of fir-<br>ing air-breathing missiles but ballistic missiles with 1500-mile capability as<br>well - the POLARIS. When these missiles and their launchers are installed in<br>nuclear powered submarines we shall have weapons in our arsenal which may<br>prove to be a real deterrent to war.</p>
<p>The NAUTILUS did not mark the end of a technological road. It marked the<br>beginning. It should be compared with the first airplane that flew at Kitty<br>Hawk</p>
<p>For every problem we have already solved in the short history of nuclear</p>
<p>power, a hundred problems remain to be solved.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>The NAUTILUS, though only 34 years old, has already inaugurated many new</p>
<p>ideas and weapons. We are now building muclear powered attack submarines whose<br>performance will surpass even that of the NAUTILUS. The SKIPJACK, soon to go<br>to sea, is expected to be the world&#x27;s fastest submarine. We have already<br>launched the TRITON, the world&#x27;s largest submarine, whose powerful twin reac-<br>tor propulsion plant will permit her to move in the vanguard of the fast<br>carrier task forces, thus providing them with up-to-the-mimte information<br>needed for protection and successful attack. The land prototype of a small<br>hunter killer submarine is nearing completion and the ship itself will be<br>delivered in the not too distant future. Nuclear power plants are now being<br>installed in REGULUS and POLARIS-firing missile submarines, We now have five<br>nuclear powered submarines in operation, and 28 more authorized or under con-<br>struction. And, it is significant that the SKATE, one of our second generation<br>nuclear submarines, under the command of Commander Calvert, not only<br>repeated the NAUTILUS transpolar voyage immediately but crossed the North Pole |<br>first east to west, then west to east, completing this double length trip |<br>without an incident.</p>
<p>Further, we are now developing nuclear propulsion plants for our surface<br>fleet. In 1961 we will have at sea the first miclear powered aircraft car-<br>rier, cruiser, and destroyer. These ships will be the prototypes for mclear<br>powered surface fleets which will provide our country with mobile bases capa-—<br>ble of moving anywhere across the oceans of the world to protect our interests.</p>
<p>Looking at these achievements from the point of view of the short time<br>that our first mclear ship has been at sea, we might be tempted to be</p>
<p>complacent. But when we consider the large numbers of Soviet submarines now</p>
<p>roaming the oceans and the great Soviet missile success, the 33 miclear sub-<br>marines pailt, puilding, or authorized are an alarmingly small protective<br>force, particularly since our 110 conventional submarines are rapidly becoming<br>obsolete, their physical plants decaying, and their usefulness in modern war-<br>fare decreasing far more rapidly than we are able to offset this disadvantage<br>by sending new muclear submarines to sea Only 13 of our operating conven-<br>tional submarines are less than 12 years old.</p>
<p>The voyage of the NAUTILUS under the North Pole is andicative of the lead<br>we now have in the field of mclear powered submarines. We enjoy today the<br>same position in this field with respect to the Soviets that we once had with<br>the development of the atomic bomb. We must remember that, in a mech shorter<br>time than predicted, the Soviets were able to match our atomic bomb capabili-<br>ties and thus to throw the black shadow of total war over the world. We mst<br>not lose sight of the fact that our competitor has matured as a scientific<br>nation and is today operating nuclear power plants in his own country. I do<br>not know how long we will be able to maintain our leadership in nuclear pow-<br>ered submarines. I do know, however, that we will soon lose this leadership<br>unless we intensify our efforts, and build rapidly upon the scientific founda-<br>tion that produced the NAUTILUS and made her epic voyage possible. To rest<br>now, with our adversary at our heels, would be fatal. Our nuclear powered<br>ships and their manifold weapon systems are the one guarantee we now have to<br>maintain freedom of the seas. We must not lose this race as we have lost</p>
<p>others. Our survival as a nation may depend upon it.</p>
