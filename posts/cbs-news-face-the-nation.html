      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1978 &quot;Face the Nation&quot; interview, Admiral Hyman Rickover forcefully steers the conversation towards the crisis in American education, asserting its paramount importance over defense spending. He highlights alarming deficiencies, stating that Navy recruits often lack basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills, necessitating the simplification of training manuals from an 11th to an 8th or 9th-grade level. Rickover cites the substantial annual education budget of $155 billion and provides a notable example of the National Education Association opposing competency testing, contrasting it with a Dallas test where over half of first-year teachers and administrators failed a 13-year-old level exam. Beyond education, he critiques broader societal and governmental dysfunction, including excessive bureaucracy, a lack of work incentives due to handouts, and a reliance on consultants, even referencing Plato&#x27;s ideal societal size of 5,040 citizens. Despite his insistence on education, reporters manage to briefly touch on his concerns regarding future claims by Electric Boat on Trident and SSN-688 class submarines, revealing Rickover&#x27;s direct and often confrontational style.</p>

<p>THIS IS RECYCLED PAPE</p>
<p>HERMAN: Admiral Rickover, this week brings two newsworthy events<br>in the United States--the ovening of the nation&#x27;s schools, and the de-<br>bate over overriding President Carter&#x27;s veto of the nuclear carrier,<br>We&#x27;ll get to education in a moment, but first, probably because it&#x27;s<br>briefer, let me ask you about the nuclear carrier. A lot of congress-<br>men want to know whether you, Admiral Rickover, think we really need it.<br>Some of them watch this program, so I&#x27;ll ask you--do we really need it?<br>Should we have it?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: The carrier issue is now un before Congress, and<br>is therefore not a subject in which I should become involved in. When-<br>ever I testify to Congress--and this does not have that--this meeting<br>here does not have that legality or formality--I will tell Congress<br>exactly what I think, as I always have. But I am not involved in extra-<br>curricular comment on what is going on between the President and the<br>Congress.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: From CBS News, Washington, a spontaneous and unrehearsed<br>news interview on FACE THE NATION, with Admiral Hyman Rickover, Deputy<br>Commander of the Naval Sea System Command for Nuclear Propulsion. Ad-<br>miral Rickover will be questioned by CBS News Correspondent Ike Pappas;<br>by Haynes Johnson, Columnist for The Washington Post; and by CBS News<br>Correspondent George Herman.</p>
<p>HERMAN: Admiral Rickover, let me try one more question which may<br>possibly be in the forbidden area that you&#x27;ve outlined, the area in<br>dispute between the President and the Congress in which you do not feel<br>you should comment. But you have advocated publicly a government take-</p>
<p>over of Navy shipbuilding yards because you say the inflated claims are</p>
<p>a form of harrassment to which the government should not continue to be</p>
<p>Subjected. Have you had any reaction from the Pentagon, from the White<br>&#x27; House, from Congress--anything in the public area-~in this line that we<br>should know about?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I regret, this is also a subject under considera-<br>tion right now by the Navy Department, and will be considered by Con-<br>gress when it returns. I regret, therefore, I cannot, nor will I com-<br>ment on that.</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Admiral, I realize what you said about extracurricular<br>comments on this program about the carrier, but there is one question,<br>that it does go beyond just a bill over money for one ship. Around<br>this swirls a controversy over the role of the Navy, what kind of a<br>Navy we have; the President has said that this would dangerously weaken<br>the Navy by adding the money for a carrier. No one in our history has<br>had more of a role in shaping the Navy, probably, than you--certainly<br>the modern Navy, the nuclear Navy. I wonder if you agree with the<br>President. Is this --is this an issue that has profound implications<br>of what kind of a force we have in the future?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Are you suggesting that I now get into opposition<br>with my Commander-in-Chief?</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Wo, no, I&#x27;m not suggesting that at all--</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I will not. I&#x27;ve already indicated that I will not<br>get into areas which are being considered by the President and by the<br>Congress. That is not my job, nor is it my duty. When I am asked by<br>Congress, in formal testimony, I will, as I always have, give my simple<br>views. And as you well know, I have never hesitated to say things<br>whether they oleased my bosses or did not please them--including the</p>
<p>President.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Admiral, I wonder if we can talk just a little bit about,<br>then, theory. The Navy&#x27;s ship inventory is down to its lowest point<br>since Pearl Harbor, and some of your critics charge that your insistence<br>on big ships, such as the nuclear carrier and the Trident submarine, is<br>the cause for this--that they&#x27;re expensive and that there&#x27;s very little<br>money left for other kinds of ships. ‘ow how do you answer those<br>charges?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: You know, you&#x27;re trying to ease into this issue.<br>When I came on this program, I did not ask to; I thought it was to talk<br>about an important subject, education, which is far more important than<br>the questions you have raised, and I suggest that you confine yourself<br>to those questions, and I will do the best I can to answer them.</p>
<p>HERMAN: Well, we have a little--</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Thirty percent of the people of the United States<br>are involved in education, either 4s students or in some form or other<br>connected with the teaching or administration of education. School<br>starts a couple of days from now, and there are some real important<br>issues. For example, I will give you one very important issue. On<br>July 3 of this year, the National Education Association, which is the<br>teachers union, held a convention in Dallas, Texas, and they came out<br>against competency testing. They said it was unfair to the teacher,<br>it was unfair to the pupil, and so on. On the 23rd of July of the same<br>year, a test was given to the first-year teachers in Dallas, and to the<br>administrators, on a 13-year old basis, and more than half of them<br>failed that test. That is the issue. If we are to spend about $155<br>billion a year, and 30 percent of our people involved, and the children</p>
<p>are involved, and they represent the future of this country and of the</p>
<p>orld, and as you well know, as the Talmud says, the world is upheld by</p>
<p>F children who study--</p>
<p>HERMAN: I&#x27;m not sure who knows what the Talmud says--</p>
<p>ADM, RICKOVER: That is far more important than any of these, what<br>I might call stupid questions that you want to ask me.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Sir, may I submit that we all understand education is a<br>very important subject.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Then let&#x27;s discuss it.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: But we all are involved in defense, students, teachers<br>and otherwise, and we&#x27;re spending $126 billion on defense this year,<br>and I&#x27;m sure that in your rare appearances, this country would like to<br>hear you out on this. We&#x27;d like to understand, first of all, some--and<br>get your views on some of the vital questions involved in our defense.<br>You&#x27;re an admiral; you&#x27;re a very well respected person in the Navy, one<br>of the leading figures in the military in the history of this country,<br>and you are before our cameras, and we feel we have to get to some of<br>these questions, and if you could answer the question-~-</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Mr. Pappas--</p>
<p>PAPPAS: --that I simply submitted to you a moment ago, I would<br>appreciate it.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: --you and every other journalist is an expert on<br>defense. I have never seen as many experts. However, I believe, with<br>no undue modesty, that I know as much about education as most people.<br>You can go to many other people to find out about aircraft carriers<br>and defense; you also have large numbers of members in Congress. But<br>you have a rare opportunity to learn something about education, and I</p>
<p>think even you, Mr. Pappas, even though you represent CBS, doesn&#x27;t know</p>
<p>erything about education.</p>
<p>HERMAN: You know, I remember some of the passages in Admiral Zum-<br>walt&#x27;s book about his interviews with you, in which you constantly re-<br>mind the people that you are interviewing that they are trying to take<br>over your interview; and now I find you doing it to us. I&#x27;m willing to<br>go along with you a little bit, but I&#x27;m amused to find you doing to us<br>what you accused so many people of doing to you--taking over the inter-<br>view.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: That is correct, and I will stop doing it when we<br>talk about education.</p>
<p>HERMAN: That&#x27;s sort of a demand, I take it.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: It&#x27;s not a demand. I&#x27;m here. I&#x27;m not here--I&#x27;m<br>here voluntarily; now, if you wish to terminate this discussion, that&#x27;s<br>perfectly all--</p>
<p>HERMAN: Do I understand you to be saying that you will not enter~<br>tain--or will not attempt to answer any guestions except on education?</p>
<p>ADM, RICKOVER: Haven&#x27;t I already made that clear?</p>
<p>HERMAN: I think probably you have, yes, sir.</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Admiral, let me try something on education that does<br>bring together--it&#x27;s a theme you have stated for at least 20 years, and<br>that&#x27;s--and I have here an old clipping from the Wall Street Journal of<br>just 20 years ago, which says that you say that education should get<br>top priority over defense spending. And I wonder how you feel about<br>how we allocate our resources today--education vis-a-vis defense--in the<br>resources of the country.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Well, we are doing that, because the amount of</p>
<p>money we&#x27;re spending on education this year, and for many other years,</p>
<p>THIS 1S RECYCLED, p Mi</p>
<p>as been much greater than defense. We&#x27;re spending $155 billion a year</p>
<p>on education; we&#x27;re soending much less than that on defense; so I think<br>that the priorities are all right. Now, whether the $155 billion is<br>being spent properly is another matter, and that should be a subject<br>of discussion.</p>
<p>HERMAN: I notice that Congressman Aspen said recently that in his<br>opinion the Army was recruiting too many bright kids and not enough of<br>what he, verhapvs unfortunately, called dummies; and I notice that the<br>United States Navy, in its personnel office, finds that it&#x27;s--there&#x27;s<br>too much illiteracy among its volunteers. Now are these two views in<br>opposition, or what&#x27;s going on?</p>
<p>ADM, RICKOVER: Well, I don&#x27;t know where Congressman Aspen gets<br>his facts. He presumably has access to good figures, but I personally<br>don&#x27;t quite see it that way.</p>
<p>HERMAN: ‘Well, what do you see in the people who are being re-<br>cruited for the Navy, in the state of their literacy, their ability to<br>take on the technical jobs of today&#x27;s Navy?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: The Navy is not getting as many qualified people<br>as we should. In fact, in the nuclear program, we have to do--go<br>through quite an expensive course of instruction prior to--</p>
<p>HERMAN: Higher instruction or-~-?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Sir?</p>
<p>HERMAN: Higher instruction or basic instruction?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Basic instruction</p>
<p>HERMAN: Why is that?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Because our schools aren&#x27;t doing the job, and I</p>
<p>thought, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to get at; you may do some good for this</p>
<p>funtry, for the people of this country, in getting off these pseudo-<br>political questions and getting onto a real subject.</p>
<p>HERMAN: I thought that&#x27;s what I was doing when I asked you about<br>why the Navy is planning these--</p>
<p>ADM, RICKOVER: No, you know, a suspicion enters in my mind. You<br>know, my opinion of CBS and the other public networks is, they&#x27;re ad-<br>vertising agencies, and all that counts with them is what will sell<br>advertising. That&#x27;s the whole function of this program. It has a<br>sponsor. And that&#x27;s why, instead of showing this program in Washington,<br>there&#x27;s a new football--professional football coach in Washington. My<br>God, that&#x27;s the biggest event in many years around here; naturally, the<br>parents who look at advertisements, possibly, for beer or deodorants<br>would much rather see--much rather see and hear the football coach talk<br>than to be concerned about the education of their children. And yet,<br>right here in the District of Columbia, we have one of the poorest<br>educational systems in the United States, despite the fact that we&#x27;re<br>spending about as much money aS any-~as anywhere, and there are more<br>functionally illiterate children proportionately, probably, than most<br>other places, and yet the parents are not--the parents would rather<br>hear the football coach.</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Admiral, may I ask you--</p>
<p>HERMAN: --answer to the question that started this all off--</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I&#x27;m trying to get it back to something rational,<br>but you--</p>
<p>HERMAN: Well, my question originally, sir--perhaps you&#x27;ve forgot-</p>
<p>ten my question--was, what is the Navy finding is the basic lack that</p>
<p>you&#x27;re having to teach these volunteers?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: The basic lack is education.</p>
<p>HERMAN: Is it technical education, mathematics, writing?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: No, no, no, it&#x27;s in reading and writing and arith-<br>metic. That&#x27;s what it is.</p>
<p>HERMAN: The basics.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: The very basics, that&#x27;s correct.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Admiral, I believe the Navy is--</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: ‘aybe I&#x27;ll get you on education, now that you<br>realize--</p>
<p>HERMAN: Well, I&#x27;m trying my best to get you there, sir.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: --it&#x27;s not only important for everybody, but it&#x27;s<br>certainly important for the military forces also.</p>
<p>HERMAN: But I&#x27;m trying to get you there, sir, and we went off on<br>football coaching. But I want to find out, what is the problem?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I didn&#x27;t get off on football. CBS got off on<br>football. (LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>PAPPAS: I understand that the Navy has had to write down its<br>manuals from, I guess, an eleventh grade level to a ninth or an eighth<br>grade level to make it more understandable for the volunteers that are<br>coming in.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: That is correct, Mr. Pappas.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Now the question is, sir, do you feel that if we had a<br>draft we&#x27;d have a better educated Navy, a better educated military? Do<br>you think we ought to give up the all-volunteer force?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Let me answer your first question. The second<br>question is a political one. I think we would do better with a draft,</p>
<p>and my personal opinion is that defense is important for the United</p>
<p>THIS 1S -RIECYGLED PAPERS<br>4c9</p>
<p>States. It should be a responsibility of every citi</p>
<p>zen, because defense</p>
<p>is for all citizens. Whether we should have a draft or not is a</p>
<p>political issue which must be decided by the President and by Congress</p>
<p>and not by me.</p>
<p>(MORE)</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Admiral, let me try something in the form of a question</p>
<p>that may, again, link the two subjects. I don’t think you -- you&#x27;d</p>
<p>agree that politics can&#x27;t be divorced from education, in that we have</p>
<p>to decide what we do in the free society to educate our people and how<br>we put the resources. I&#x27;m interested in -- aside of that, you have<br>been, in the past for many, many years, warning us about the allocation<br>of resources, the dimunition of energy, and so forth, and I wonder</p>
<p>there which is -- whether it&#x27;s the lack of the schools. We can&#x27;t --</p>
<p>the President can&#x27;t get energy legislation through the Congress, a<br>volitical process that affects everything else in the future. I wonder<br>where you put the -- the blame. Why is it that we can&#x27;t seem to operate<br>and function that way politically?</p>
<p>ADI!. RICKOVER: First, the government and the country today is<br>more complex than any society has ever been. I have grave doubts that<br>a democracy consisting of 218 million people can be run as a pure<br>democracy, yet we are trying still to run it that way. I have very<br>grave doubts about it, and the reason is not the number, the reason is<br>this football game. People are not -- people are only -~ now have a<br>pretty good life and everybody is taken care of. HE!! spends 181 billion<br>dollars a year, and in many cases there is no real incentive for people<br>to work anymore, and that&#x27;s a natural human tendency, so why should they<br>work when they can get handouts? And I -~ my opinion, and I&#x27;m not<br>talking about the money part of it, but what impact it has on the<br>character of our people and how they live and what they consider<br>important.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s get back to the Presidency because that&#x27;s part of it.</p>
<p>Now, aS you may know from your history, even the Lord Jesus Christ only</p>
<p>THIS TS RECYCLED PAPER</p>
<p>patted ninety one and a half percent ih choosing followers, but we<br>expect the President of the United States to be pluperfect, even more<br>perfect than the Lord, and we don&#x27;t understand. We put a man in a job<br>with little power, little authority, and we expect him to do everything<br>that every citizen wants, and yet we have problems which appear are</p>
<p>not even being solved either by business, by the press, certainly by<br>the commercial TV stations, or by Congress, and -- but we expect him<br>to do it, and that means we don&#x27;t have a fundamental understanding<br>what government is all about, and the basic thing is the people are not<br>interested in the little dirty things that you should have.</p>
<p>Now, back in ancient Greece Plato said that the ideal number of<br>citizens for a country was five thousand and forty, and that was based<br>on the fact that on the hill of the Pnyx where the ecclesia met,<br>that is, all the voting citizens, could only accommodate five thousand and<br>forty people and you could have a pure democracy. That number was<br>determined by how many people could gather in an audience and be heard<br>by a single speaker.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Admiral, may I ask you another question?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Aren&#x27;t you interested in things like that, Mr.<br>Pappas, or on football?</p>
<p>PAPPAS: I am quite interested, sir: I&#x27;ve been listening to you</p>
<p>very attentively, but I do have another question on another subject.<br>In a memo dated August 14 from you to the Secretary of the Navy, which<br>I have here, you say that Electric Boat is actively laying the ground=<br>work for future claims on Trident and SSN-688 class submarines. Those<br>are the attack submarines. These are two programs that you pushed.</p>
<p>We had just gotten done with a big claim settlement with General</p>
<p>THIS Is RECYCLED PAPER</p>
<p>Dynamics. The question is how much of a claim do you expect on the big</p>
<p>Trident submarine, and why are these claims still going on, and why<br>can‘t the Navy manage its ship building program better?</p>
<p>ADM. PICKOVER: Now, you&#x27;re again getting me into an issue which<br>I have taken up with my boss and you would like me to start in taking<br>on the officials of the Defense Department. Let me tell you this. If<br>I am asked such questions by a Congressional committee, and it would be<br>in open testimony, if you can arrange such testimony I will be very<br>happy to testify.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Admiral, I&#x27;m not in the Conaress. This is taxpayer money<br>we&#x27;re talking about. you&#x27;re talking to taxpayers at this moment.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Yes- I&#x27;m talking about taxpayers money -</p>
<p>PAPPAS: You are facing taxpayers.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: That&#x27;s right.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: And it’s their money that&#x27;s involved.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: But I don&#x27;t know -~</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Millions and millions of dollars.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: But T am not so sure ~~</p>
<p>PAPPAS: And I think they have a right to understand why you feel<br>there&#x27;s going to be more claims put in on the Trident?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: “Shy do you have a special right? What reason?</p>
<p>PAPPAS: Because it’s their money.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Is it your money, too?</p>
<p>PAPPAS: ‘Well, yes, it is. And it&#x27;s yours.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Well, then I&#x27;1l tell you the story that a captain<br>of a battleship ~~</p>
<p>PAPPAS: I&#x27;d like to know myself, not as a renorter but as a</p>
<p>THIS IS REGYCLED PAPER</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>taxpayer.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I&#x27;11 tell you the story. This woman visited the<br>battleship and she insisted on doing certain things. She said she was<br>a part owner of the ship and he reached down and he picked up a wooden<br>sliver off the quarter deck and gave it to her. Now, here, madam is<br>your part of the ship; now, get off the ship.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: I think it&#x27;s less gimolistic than that.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: If you wane these questions asked you can readily<br>arrange for a Congressional committee to ask me, and it will be an onen<br>session and you will get my answer. You already have my answer ina<br>letter anyway.</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Let me try something else. TO follow up what you were<br>saying just a moment ago about -~- maybe democracy isn&#x27;t working well,<br>Admiral; I wonder about the government itself, the operation. You have<br>been very critical, again, over the years of the bureaucracy, the way<br>Washington works; do you have any sort of suggestions? There&#x27;s an<br>area where people within the government are charged with making changes,<br>of functioning better. How can we do it better?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Yes, I -~ I have in a general way. We are living<br>in a highly technical society and it is getting more technical. The<br>curse, in my opinion, of business and of government is this excessive<br>management and system analysis. We believe now that any problem in<br>this world can be solved by consultants, and so on. In fact, it&#x27;s even<br>getting into theology. That is absolutely wrong. Mothing useful will<br>ever be done except by human beings; and whenever we try to impersonalize<br>operations this is what we get, we get huge organizations. It&#x27;s true</p>
<p>in education. You remember. We used to have a one; a one-room</p>
<p>—<br>THIS IS RECYCLED PAPER</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>schoolhouse with one teacher. Today only one third of the people in<br>the educational system are teachers; the rest of them are all adminis-<br>trators, who are battening off the thing. That is wrong in government,<br>it&#x27;s wrong in business, it’s wrong in newspapers, and it&#x27;s wrong in CBS<br>also. It&#x27;s wrong all over.</p>
<p>Now, have I answered that question?</p>
<p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Now, you can ask me any embafrassing question that<br>you wish, except that -- you&#x27;ll lay off this Defense Department business<br>where issues are being considered by them and by -- and in Congress.<br>That is unfair.</p>
<p>HERMAN: Let me try one, then.</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I&#x27;ll tell you another part of that. We have many<br>appointed officials, but what I have seen in my many years here nearly<br>all of them soon act as if they&#x27;re annointed, and it reminds me of when<br>the kings of France were crowned and they stuck up a little -- a pigeon.<br>way up in the eaves with a little bottle of holy oil attached to it.<br>Now, today every official that&#x27;s appointed now, obviously, has his<br>little bottle of holy oil and he becomes annointed, he become sacrosanct<br>and his word counts.</p>
<p>HERMAN: Let me try one along this line. You said a few moments<br>ago that people have -- because of the way government operates in this<br>country, people have no incentive to work hard. Is that correct? That&#x27;s<br>your feeling?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: That doesn&#x27;t apply to everybody, but the incentive<br>is not there for those who normally wouldn&#x27;t want to work anyway, and</p>
<p>who can get almost as much on a handout as they would by using effort.</p>

<p>HERMAN: What -~- what I&#x27;m trying to find out, since you so broadly</p>
<p>indicted the whole society of --</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I&#x27;m not indicting the whole society.</p>
<p>HERMAN: Well, you -- from football through school --</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: You know, if I were to sit here and be exact in<br>every statement I make I&#x27;d have to have several dictionaries and ency-<br>Clopedias. I&#x27;m talking as a human being.</p>
<p>HERMAN: What I&#x27;m trying to find out -- your view as a human<br>being, whether you are deeply pessimistic to the extent that you feel<br>that this process is no longer reversible, that we are too late to be<br>saved?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Oh, I don&#x27;t think anything -- and there&#x27;s always<br>death. That reverses things.</p>
<p>HERMAN; That irreverses, as well, in some ways. But do you think<br>that this picture that you see, and the American people that you see<br>struggling with this, can be and will be turned around?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: Of course, it will be turned around when the energy<br>crunch comes, when we start in running out of our easily obtainable<br>natural resources. It will run out. I look at this whole era as a<br>sort of a little pimple on top of a curve. It&#x27;ll go down.</p>
<p>PAPPAS: I&#x27;d like to -- before -- before the time runs out I&#x27;ve<br>had a question that I&#x27;ve been wanting to ask you for so long when I<br>interviewed you. I have heard, and it&#x27;s been said for so many years,<br>that you&#x27;ve established your own Navy within the Navy, the Rickover<br>Navy, that you operate independently of the rest of the Navy. How do<br>you react to that kind of comment?</p>
<p>ADM. RICKOVER: I don&#x27;t. If I didn&#x27;t turn out a good job, do you</p>

<p>think the Navy, or anyone else, would let me get away with it? I do</p>
<p>it by making the ships work better than any</p>
<p>other ships in the Navy</p>
<p>and they’re the most difficult, and that&#x27;s why I get by with it. If</p>
<p>they want to beat me they ought to put in a better system.</p>
<p>JOHNSON s</p>
<p>Admiral, about your relationship with President Carter</p>
<p>~= this is a personal question, now.</p>
<p>How do you feel that he&#x27;s doing?</p>
<p>He&#x27;s someone =~ I&#x27;m not ta</p>
<p>liking about the spyecific issues, but just in</p>
<p>the terms of leadership.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve said that presidents can&#x27;t be plu-</p>
<p>perfect, shouldn&#x27;t be judged that way.</p>
<p>How do you feel that he&#x27;s doing<br>in terms of --</p>
<p>ADIT. RICKOVER: I think that, under the circumstances, he&#x27;s doing a</p>
<p>darn good job, but people expect him to do everything. He cannot. He</p>
<p>doesn’t have the power. He&#x27;s only one single human being; and I could</p>
<p>talk more on that subject --</p>
<p>HERMAN: But time won&#x27;t allow us. Thank you very much, Admiral</p>
<p>Rickover, for being our guest today on FACE THE WATION.<br>ADM. RICKOVER: It&#x27;s finished?</p>
