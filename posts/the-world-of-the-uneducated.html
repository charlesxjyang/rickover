      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s &quot;The World of the Uneducated,&quot; delivered in Albuquerque, New Mexico on October 22, 1959, is a scathing critique of American &quot;progressive education&quot; and a passionate defense of traditional, knowledge-based learning. Following an opening tribute to Senator Clinton Anderson, Rickover distinguishes sharply between true &quot;education&quot;—which fosters intellectual growth, self-awareness, and the pursuit of truth—and &quot;training,&quot; focused on vocational skills and &quot;life adjustment.&quot; He argues that the progressive school system, by confusing these aims and de-emphasizing core academic subjects, has produced a functionally illiterate populace (citing 10% functional illiteracy and a 1957 Gallup Poll showing only one in six Americans read a book) unable to think critically or contribute effectively to democracy. Rickover contrasts the U.S. approach with the more rigorous educational systems in Europe and Russia, asserting that America&#x27;s &quot;knowledge gap&quot; threatens its technological power and national survival, referencing John Dewey, Kilpatrick, and the U.S. Office of Education&#x27;s &quot;Life Adjustment for Every Youth&quot; booklet as examples of the misguided philosophy he believes undermines the nation.</p>

<p>FOR RELEASE ON DELIVERY<br>THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1959<br>Remarks prepared by VADM H. G. Rickover, USN<br>Assistant Director for Naval Reactors<br>Division of Reactor Development 12<br>U. S.

<p>THE WORLD OF THE UNEDUCATED</p>
<p>I am very happy to be here in New Mexico with you, although<br>I don&#x27;t often venture this far from the ocean.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about one of my favorite subjects, our<br>educational system. But first I would like to take a. brief moment<br>to pay a birthday tribute to a man who shares my deep interest in<br>education, the man who is responsible in more ways than one for<br>my being here today, your own Senator Clinton Anderson.</p>
<p>— There is no need for me ‘to recount his career in detail to<br>you, because you know it better than I. How he came to New Mexico<br>at the age of 22, suffering from biberculestes how he conquered<br>his illness and spent what I happen to know were four of the happiest<br>years of his\life as a reporter on the Albuquerque Journal. How<br>he served with distinction as a state official, a United States<br>Representative, \and Secretary of Agriculture. And how he is now</p>
<p>concluding his ‘second term as one of the \most dedicated and</p>
<p>influential members of the Senate. He has ‘also found time to</p>
<p>EUV</p>
<p>run a successful business and to become an acknowledged expert<br>on Southwestern history.</p>
<p>But Clinton Anderson&#x27;s greatest contributions to his country,<br>I think, have been made in: the last eight years through his position<br>as a member and chairman of. the Joint Committee on Atomic<br>Energy. It is in this capacity that I have come to know him, and<br>to acquire the deepest admiration and respect for him.</p>
<p>The still-young atomic age, which was born in your own state<br>of New Mexico owes Clinton Anderson a debt which can never be<br>repaid. For eight years he has battled to provide the United<br>States with the atomic tools to enable our country to realize the<br>full potential of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Because of Clinton Anderson! 5 help we today have shippingport,<br>the world&#x27;s first civilian power reactor. Under his chairmanship<br>the Joint. ‘Committee has held valuable hearings on such subjects as<br>the effects of radioactive fallout, \aisposal of radioactive<br>wastes, the possible consequences of &amp; nuclear war, and other<br>erucial questions of the atomic age--the printed records of these<br>hearings represent the &quot;Bibles&quot; of the field. Clinton Anderson<br>coauthored the valuable Price-Anderson Bill providing indemnity</p>
<p>insurance mal atomic reactor accidents. His leadership resulted<br>; ‘</p>
<p>in the 1958 amendments to the Atomic Energy Act to permit the</p>
<p>exchange of nuclear information and materials With our allies. He<br>has waged a continuing campaign against unnecessary secrecy in</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>\<br>atomic energy, particularly where the health and walfare of the</p>
<p>citizenry is concerned. @</p>
<p>To me, of course, his greatest achievement has been his devotim<br>to the cause of the nuclear Navy. Because of his unfailing support,<br>the United States as yet possesses the world&#x27;s only fleet of nuclear<br>submarines--the one field in which we can claim Supremacy over Russia.</p>
<p>In my efforts to obtain more and better atomic vessels, I have<br>always known that I could count on the wholehearted backing of<br>Clinton Anderson, and I would like to take this occasion to express<br>my deep gratitude to him.</p>
<p>New Mexico is indeed fortunate to have a citizen like Clinton<br>Anderson. Let us all congratulate him as he celebrates his 64th<br>birthday. |</p>
<p>And now, back to the main topic of my talk here today--education.</p>
<p>For some years a debate over American education has been going<br>on which threatens to deteriorate into fruitless wrangling.</p>
<p>With increasing determination, one side defends a status quo in<br>which it has a vested interest; the other urges vainly that the<br>rights of America&#x27;s children and the survival of the nation in<br>freedom and prosperity must be placed above this narrow self-interest.<br>Let us try to get back to fundamentals. What do we conceive<br>education to be and how does the educated person differ from the<br>uneducated? What do we expect our tax-supported public schools<br>to do for our children? What part in raising youngsters to<br>adulthood is properly their province? Let us try to segregate<br>from the bitter battle over methods, standards, democratic versus<br>class education, and similar generalities, the real issue that<br>divides those who represent what we may term the &quot;traditional&quot;</p>
<p>-3-</p>
<p>viewpoint on education from those who represent what may be termed</p>
<p>the &quot;progressive&quot; viewpoint.<br>The title of this is &quot;The World of the &#x27;Uneducated&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish through this title to emphasize the two sides of un-education<br>which are often confused: first, the effect which lack of education</p>
<p>has.on the individual&#x27;s comprehension of the world around him and 3:</p>
<p>on his ability to make a personal success; second, the effect .<br>upon the world of the attitudes and actions of uneducated people--<br>specifically, the effect upon a democratic society of the manner<br>in which the &quot;uneducated&quot; person carries out his duties as a<br>citizen. By “uneducated&quot; I mean persons who have not obtained<br>what in Western civilization is termed an &quot;education&quot;.</p>
<p>Education is but one of the two processes by which children.<br>are guided into adulthood; the other is training. Unless we clearly :</p>
<p>understand the distinction between education and training, we will</p>
<p>not discover why our expensive educational plant produces so little.</p>
<p>genuine education compared to schools in other Western countries,<br>and in Russia. Right here, the traditionalist parts company with =<br>the progressive. The traditionalist sees the distinction clearly, |<br>the progressive does not. In the opinion of the traditionalist,<br>confusion of education with training is one of the main reasons<br>for the poor performance of our schools. It may be mentioned in -<br>passing that the progressive philosophy of education, in<br>particular its equation of education with training, is a uniquely<br>——_—</p>
<p>aN</p>
<p>American phenomenon and a very recent one, too. For a time<br>Russian educators took over much of this theory but it was dropped |<br>there 25 years ago when they found that progressive education did |<br>not really &quot;educate&quot;; nor has the theory been accepted in the</p>
<p>school system of any other advanced modern nation.</p>
<p>As understood in the west education goes to the whole of a<br>man&#x27;s personality, and seeks to raise, enrich and expand it by |<br>widening his intellectual horizon; training, in contrast, m merely a con<br>seeks to fit the young into the particular society into which a</p>
<p>they have been born. Let me elaborate: os</p>
<p>Education is directed towards enlargement of the individual&#x27;s</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>comprehension of the world poy giving him the knowledge and the</p>
<p>mental capacity to understand what lies beyond the narrow sphere ne</p>
<p>of his personal experience and observation. It familiarizes him yen</p>
<p>with events and people, distant in time or space, 80 that he can<br>form independent judgments on social manifestations. It renders<br>intelligible to him the physical world and the laws of nature, :<br>so that he can judge man&#x27;s potentialities and anitations-aewe |</p>
<p>place in nature.</p>
<p>Training, on the other hand, develops in youth such character</p>
<p>traits as are deemed desirable by the predominant ethical and</p>
<p>religious beliefs of the community ,and teaches socially approved</p>
<p>- peasnaererpgeiy yrea~ st y 5-9 emanate</p>
<p>habits in manners, mores, and personal appearance. Such formation</p>
<p>of attitudes and habits can properly be called “life adjustment&quot;</p>
<p>3-5</p>
<p>or adjustment to the “peer group&quot;, to borrow favorite expressions<br>of progressive education. Training also develops vocational skills<br>which qualify one to earn his living as a skilled worker or<br>technician doing a specific type of routine work.</p>
<p>As in all human activities, the mind comes into play when<br>one is trained, but training does not stretch the mind; the intellect<br>4s not improved by acquiring habits or learning mechanical aki its; ;</p>
<p>nor will routine work of itself enlarge one&#x27;s mental capacities,</p>
<p>as will hard thinking. Anyone who has ever tackled a difficult” °°”<br>subject such as higher mathematics, and used it to solve seis _<br>problems, knows that he has emerged from this experience with a oa<br>mind that functions better. Thereafter, he will find it easter tow<br>tackle other subjects and other problems because his mental capacity&quot;<br>has grown, In contrast, neither learning to typewrite, nor spending —<br>years pounding a typewriter, makes him better able to reasong-pbither<br>has an effect on the quality of his intellect. er ene<br>His intellect is but one facet of the child&#x27;s personality</p>
<p>which must be developed. The traditionalists do not claim that.<br>there are not others which require training. What they Stress is<br>that both education and training are needed to guide young people<br>into adulthood, but that in a five-hour day, and a 180-day school year,<br>it is impossible for our schools to do both. Traditionally, |<br>training has been the responsibility of family and church; much</p>
<p>of it comes about merely through a young person&#x27;s experiences in</p>
<p>Ht</p>
<p>growing up--training is to a large part the progressive educationists?<br>&quot;learning through living&quot;. But education is &quot;learning through<br>instruction&quot; and properly the province of educational institutions.<br>Most parents and various other agencies are able to give training,</p>
<p>but few parents and no other public agencies, except Schools are</p>
<p>able to give instruction. Except in boarding schools, there is</p>
<p>not enough time for teachers to take on the entire job of raising —<br>our children. We cannot abdicate our responsibilities to them,</p>
<p>nor allow the teachers to take them off our shoulders against our<br>will, It is impossible for our schools to educate &quot;the whole chia&quot;;</p>
<p>their attempt to do so has failed, and our children are neither. .</p>
<p>well educated nor--unless parents have taken a hand--even well<br>trained. Parents, church, community, and school--all: are needed<br>for the job of raising our children. ,</p>
<p>_ Though we love them dearly, candor forces us to admit that<br>newborn babies are ignorant, selfish, ruthless little savages. If<br>they were left to grow up without adult guidance--no matter how<br>well-cared for they might be physically--twenty years hence they<br>would still be ignorant, selfish and ruthless. The only change<br>would be, that what at birth was an appealing little savage would<br>by then have become a not so appealing big savage.</p>
<p>In every society above the level of savagery the adult<br>community join forces to raise their young so that they will</p>
<p>outgrow the self-centered world of babyhood. By what one might</p>
<p>“3-11</p>
<p>-eall an over-all house-breaking program, the baby is gradually<br>adjusted to the society which was fashioned by his forbears. He<br>4s taught personal habits which make him pleasant to have around;<br>he is conditioned to fit smoothly into a way of life which the<br>adult community wishes to perpetuate.</p>
<p>Every child needs training for adulthood. But important as<br>training is, it will not dispel the ignorance of the newborn babe<br>and tur him into an &quot;educated&quot; adult. It is true that children<br>are usually given a considerable amount of education in the home,<br>but while this was sufficient in pre-industrial societies it is<br>rarely so in modern nations. Education, for the most part, must<br>come through formal instruction in schools. |</p>
<p>In all countries belonging to the civilization of the West--<br>even those only marginally attached to it--the idea of what</p>
<p>constitutes education has been permanently shaped by the glorious pee</p>
<p>Greek concept that the pursuit of knowledge is man&#x27;s noblest<br>activity. Let us not forget that all of the West&#x27;s fabulous<br>victories over grinding human labor, disabling disease, and<br>burdensome superstition grew out of the Greek belief in the<br>value of knowledge and of reasoning based on knowledge. This</p>
<p>respect for knowledge led the West--and only the West--to Anvent</p>
<p>educational institutions dedicated to preservation and increase coal</p>
<p>of knowledge, and to transmission from generation to generation of<br>knowledge, and of the ability to use knowledge. This is why--</p>
<p>despite interruptions of dark ages, wars, revolutions, famines,</p>
<p>B- 3</p>
<p>plagues,and all kinds of civic disturbances--the civilization of<br>the West has gone on building knowledge upon knowledge, thereby<br>expanding man&#x27;s understanding of himself and of the world he lives<br>in, and promoting his ability to put the forces cf nature to good<br>use for himself. |</p>
<p>The task of educational institutions in the West has always —</p>
<p>been threefold: first, to pass on the accumulated knowledge of</p>
<p>the past; second, to develop youth in mind and body so that they - ah</p>
<p>will be able to absorb what is already known and to apply it to</p>
<p>the myriad problems of life; third, to encourage the creatively ot<br>endowed to pioneer beyond the frontiers of knowledge, and thereby © _<br>to increase the existing store of knowledge. No other civilization</p>
<p>ever invented institutions serving this threefold purpose, though &gt;</p>
<p>many have now copied western education.</p>
<p>As conceived in the West, education resembles nothing so much ae</p>
<p>as a lighting of lamps in the minds of the young. These lamps are<br>lighted by a torch handed down through the generations, all the :<br>way back to the sources of our civilization. As the lamps are<br>lighted, one by one, different sections of the world become distinct<br>and comprehensible. Time, cost, and mental endowment control</p>
<p>the number of lamps that are lighted for each individual. The more<br>the better, but even a single lamp is worth more than any number</p>
<p>of pleasant habits or mechanical skills which may at first glance</p>
<p>appear more “useful&quot;.</p>
<p>#4</p>
<p>oe = : —</p>
<p>: a 3</p>
<p>Acquisition of an elementary education that enables one to</p>
<p>read and write enriches personal life, and makes one a more competent<br>person than do social poise or being handy with tools. It is tragic<br>that not a few American youngsters graduate from high school without<br>being truly literate~-some ten percent of our people are estimated<br>to be functionally illiterate. Without literacy one eannot<br>communicate with others from whom he is separated by time or space,<br>nor enjoy the treasures locked in good books. Literacy is basic .<br>to education, yet our schools have not succeeded in teaching all</p>
<p>our children to read with ease, to spell correctly, to write<br>grammatically, and to express themselves clearly in writing.</p>
<p>For years I have asked foreign educators: &quot;How many of your<br>children do you believe to be similarly deficient?* Their answers<br>range from a categorical &quot;none&quot;, to &quot;very few&quot;--children who live<br>too isolated to get to school regularly or those who have a very |<br>low intellect. In most advanced nations eight to nine-year<br>schooling has been compulsory for a century or more. Besides<br>much else, children there have certainly learned to master the<br>mother tongue; thus they have acquired the key which can open<br>up to them all the self-education obtainable through good books.<br>This mastery and this key not a few of our own average and below<br>average children never obtain, although they go to school twelve</p>
<p>years. Even some whose minds are good .¢ ough for college still</p>
<p>require remedial courses in English! ie</p>
<p>xe</p>
<p>f<br>f</p>
<p>Abroad, schools above the elementary level, whether for the<br>slow learner or the talented youth who may later prepare for a |<br>professional career, all concentrate on providing a liberal |<br>education which balances the humanities and the sciences. Through i<br>such an education young people are given a foundation in the<br>specialized knowledge that deals with Man and with Nature. The<br>lamps that light up mental concepts about ‘man include history</p>
<p>which illuminates the past and thus makes current events</p>
<p>comprehensible; economics which familiarizes us with the material<br>bases of our existence; anthropolgy which contributes to our<br>understanding of the slow march of mankind from primitive tribe<br>to modern society; foreign languages and literatures which give. uel<br>insight into the psyche of other people who have contributed |<br>The lamps that light up mental concepts about Nature and the .</p>
<p>Universe include mathematics which clarifies our comprehension of</p>
<p>quantity and relations of masses and thus gives us a foundation</p>
<p>for understanding science; geography and geology which give us a<br>clear idea of the physical shape of the earth and its Limitations<br>within which we must order our lives; the exact sciences which</p>
<p>give us an insight into ways to make nature our servant. Set apart<br>from knowledge which is an intellectual concept, are art and music;<br>these too belong to liberal education. They enable us to enjoy<br>leisure by leaving our humdrum lives behind, soaring into</p>
<p>imaginative worlds.</p>
<p>pil</p>
<p>None of this enrichment of life is accessible to the .</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>uneducated person. All require long and sustained effort. For</p>
<p>most people study is hard enough under skillful and scholarly |<br>instruction; to make up for educational deprivation suffered in |<br>school, by acquiring an education entirely on one&#x27;s own, requires |<br>rare drive and perserverance. Relatively few will achieve it.</p>
<p>The traditionalist case against those who now run.our schools. |<br>is that by concentrating on training they have short-changed the</p>
<p>education of our children. They have given up too soon trying to</p>
<p>educate slow learners and children with little desire for learning, an<br>and they have steered them into training before they have absorbed</p>
<p>much more than an elementary education. A principal reason for</p>
<p>doing this has been confusion of education with training; this shows. ..<br>up clearly in the official dogma that there is no hierarchy among .<br>sub jects--that homemaking 4s as valuable as history, manners as wtliet4t</p>
<p>mathematics. Homemaking and manners belong to training; history</p>
<p>Pl ra</p>
<p>and mathematics to education. All, however, count anemesh towards</p>
<p>a high school diploma, and the child is in large part free to<br>choose among them.<br>The freedom given children to plan their own course of study<br>is part of the progressive belief that schools must be child-centered--<br>a fantastic concept when you think it through. How can a child, | |<br>born ignorant, know what 4t needs to learn? How can we leave<br>him to his own devices and refuse him the loving guidance that<br>trains and educates him for adulthood? By what tortured thinking</p>
<p>Y-12</p>
<p>have progressives come to believe that democracy in the classroom<br>ought to turn the teacher from an instructor who imparts knowledge<br>to the ignorant, into a “pesources&quot; person who is merely a senior |<br>comrade in a group engaged in studying what the children have</p>
<p>agreed would be fun to study?</p>
<p>Kilpatrick, chief disciple of John Dewey, the father of ah ob. |<br>progressive education, and who has probably influenced children. .</p>
<p>and teachers even more than the latter, was “adamant that the</p>
<p>teacher should not make a practice of substituting his- purposes<br>and wishes forthe echila&#x27;s,.&quot; His biographer reports that<br>Kilpatrick felt, SAE TS the child and the children who should<br>originate tasks “ana purposes. The best and richest learnings</p>
<p>result only when self-propelled interests are being carried out...</p>
<p>For that reason he wanted no curriculum set in advance, nor did<br>he want teachers to &#x27;sell! or foist subject matter on the child.&quot;<br>He feared that if standards of academic achievement were set,</p>
<p>&quot;there is the ever-present and inherent danger that the child</p>
<p>will be coerced, and coercion ‘seldom builds desirable habits! .&quot; 47</p>
<p>In its widely distributed booklet, &quot;Life Adjustment for Every<br>Youth,&quot; the U. S. office of Education sets goals for secondary<br>education which are almost wholly non-intellectual. The Office<br>apparently subscribes to the belief that three fifths of our</p>
<p>children are incapable of absorbing a genuine education or, for</p>
<p>that matter, even of becoming skilled technicians. It therefore</p>
<p>A413</p>
<p>advocates life-ad ustment education for all children. This</p>
<p>4s defined as &quot;that which better equips all Amersqen outh to<br>live democratically with satisfaction to themselves and profit</p>
<p>to society as home members, workers, and citizens<br>Among some fourteen specific goals of life-adjustment education,<br>one searches in vain for recognition that education deals with<br>the intellect. Hostility to the traditional subjects of secondary<br>education. ===, 4s evident throughout the pamphlet, as it is<br>in almost all the writings of progressive educationists. For the<br>past ten years, I have been collecting pertinent statements</p>
<p>| revealing this attitudes from these I choose at random the<br>following--none of them unusual; all of them typical of<br>progressive thinking. ae)</p>
<p>On literacy, John Dewey has this to say: wwhat avail is ites.<br>to win ability to read and write if in the process the individual<br>loses his own soul; loses his appreciation of Ture worth while,</p>
<p>of the values to which these things are relative.&quot; Ne wonder,<br>the principal of 4 junior high school some years ago publicly<br>challenged the prime purpose of school 4 which is to make our<br>children literate, with the statement nat, &quot;we shall some day<br>accept the thought that it is just as 4llogical to assume that<br>every boy must be able to read as it is that each one must be<br>able to play the violin, that it is no more reasonable to require<br>that each girl shall spell well than 4t is that each one shall<br>bake a good cherry pie.&quot; eee, che |</p>
<p>- Kilpatrick&#x27;s blogeapher quotes him-as saying of arithmetic:</p>
<p>LA Pr tt<br>nd a lot of people who don&#x27;t use arithmetic; and I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>think that life would igo richer for then they peed Ito</p>
<p>They just don&#x27;t need 11! of modern Languages y Woon the average<br>atudent it Fig7a great waste of time, In terms of rich, vital<br>interests that might lead to individual growth, languages offer<br>meager possibilities.&quot; EL « |</p>
<p>No wonder that we have co Areve professors who state that<br>Greek or Latin are not as useful as knowing how to drive or take<br>a car apart, or that Kilpatrick&#x27;s biographer reports having<br>seen &quot;a class of six hundred and more graduate students in<br>education, comprising teachers, principals, superintendents,<br>vote their opinion in overwhelming numbers that Greek, Latin, and<br>mathematics offered the least likely possibilities for educational<br>growth; and with almost the same unanimity they placed dancing,<br>dvamatics, and doll playing high on the list in this regard.&quot;</p>
<p>In progressive thought, the school no longer lights the<br>lamps of knowledge; its primary pusiness, in Dewey&#x27;s opinion,<br>4s to train children in cooperative and mutually helpfull living.<br>‘So trained iy would then presumably answer the ideal set by<br>Kilpatrick wid &quot;Wanted each person so to live and so to do that<br>what he wanted and sought that was good for himself and for his</p>
<p>family he should want and seek to make available to every other</p>
<p>person and every other family.&quot; maa —_<br>pis</p>
<p>Progressive dogma has sold out the American dream that in<br>this country the best of education should be free to every child,<br>since what we are giving the majority of our children is rarely<br>education above the elementary level--education which has for a<br>century and more been free and compulsory in all advanced Western</p>
<p>nations. The best of education now costs more money here and</p>
<p>takes three to four years longer to obtain than in other democracies</p>
<p>and in totalitarian Russia; abroad, even professional education is</p>
<p>either free or costs so little that few are barred by poverty.</p>
<p>This would at all times constitute a serious indictment of</p>
<p>our schools. It is doubly so at present, when education determines - |</p>
<p>technological power; when our adversary in the technological race<br>puts about as many of his ehildren through a rigorous ten-year<br>school devoted to educating them in the humanities, mathematics<br>and the sciences as we put of ours through high school, where a<br>majority receive little more than elementary education. It is true<br>that lately we have begun to toughen curricula a bit, but the<br>knowledge gap between Russian and American youngsters remains<br>wider than we can safely tolerate. I contend that we cannot</p>
<p>allow ourselves to forget the Russian educational challenge for</p>
<p>a Single moment. No amount of talk about the ruthless exploitation<br>of talent by Russia&#x27;s rulers and the alleged advantages of<br>&quot;educating the whole child&quot; can change the ominous significance</p>
<p>of these figures.</p>
<p>Today technological advances are rarely brought about<br>through purely mechanical skill, which merely improves known<br>techniques through ingenuity of manipulation; it comes through<br>the ability of talented, well educated persons with highly<br>developed professional skills to apply known principles to<br>unforeseen problems ,and through this to derive new principles,<br>and so on ad infinitum. Existing knowledge is the foundation<br>upon which new knowledge is built; pure speculation without a<br>foundation of knowledge will not get us far. The country that<br>has the greatest number of genuinely educated people must<br>inevitably win out in the end. Those who prevent our schools</p>
<p>from really educating our youth undermine the foundations of our ;<br>| freedom and national power. These are harsh words but they are<br>the absolute truth.</p>
<p>Yet in the debate about the kind of education our tax-supported _<br>schools ought to provide, we must never forget that ina<br>democratic society there is no conflict between the interest of<br>the individual in obtaining the personal advantages that come<br>from being educated jand those of the nation in having educated<br>citizens, To dismiss our educational inferiority vis-a-vis the<br>Russians by saying that our schools are concerned only with the<br>happiness of the individual whereas Russian schools are concerned<br>only with producing useful Soviet citizens is to dwell on</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>4iprelevancies. A clear understanding of education and a thorough</p>
<p>A277</p>
<p>knowledge of history would prevent such confused thinking. The<br>educational debate now going on bogs down in irrelevancies<br>because it is muddied by the posture of the progressive<br>educationists who equate their kind of life-adjustment education<br>with democracy, and the traditionalist&#x27;s kind of education with<br>aristocarcy or totalitarianism. ©</p>
<p>This is historically incorrect. Authoritarian Prussia was<br>one of the first states to establish free compulsory elementary<br>education--antedating by almost a century. such education in<br>parliamentary England and democratic Americas; she also supported<br>inexpensive academic secondary schools earlier than other more<br>democratic countries. Of the nations of Europe where everyone<br>could read and write many decades before this skill became<br>universal in other countries--including our own--some were absolute<br>or constitutional monarchies, others limited or absolute<br>democracies. The world&#x27;s oldest living democracy--Switzerland--<br>provided education for all its children earlier than the world&#x27;s<br>second oldest--the United States. Japan--certainly no democracy<br>before World War II--has fewer illiterates than we. Education<br>like art, music, and science is a cultural activity which is not<br>necessarily dependent on a country&#x27;s particular form of government.<br>When it is conceived of as transmission of knowledge in the<br>humanities and the sciences, and as a process.of developing the<br>power of the intellect, then education has in it an element of<br>universality; then it can be compared, and one country can learn</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>from another.</p>
<p>One might think that everyone would agree that such a</p>
<p>comparison is possible as well as useful. But this is unacceptable<br>to American educationists. They confuse the issue in the current<br>educational debate by arguing about what is and what is not<br>democratic in education, as witness the following statement made<br>by a prominent educationist before a Committee of the United BE teR<br>Senate: &quot;Good teaching of reading beyond the fundamentals...is | on<br>one thing in a society where a person is being prepared to read.<br>‘-and instantaneously believe government propaganda, and it isan<br>entirely different thing in a society where a person may be |<br>expected to enjoy the privilege of reading a free press.&quot;</p>
<p>The real issue of course is that by their expertmentation<br>with newfangled ideas about as simple a task as teaching children<br>to read, progressive educaticnists have brought us to the<br>intolerable situation where many American children--after twelve<br>years of schooling--cannot read well at all. Many high school<br>students have only fourth or fifth grade redding ability. Abroad,<br>the teaching of reading and writing is accomplished without<br>fanfare, why not here? What-adults will read is a rather<br>academic question if many of our children cannot read with ease.<br>That Russian schools--as other European schools--teach children<br>to read has probably much to do with the fact, commented upon by<br>many American observers, that Russians are avid readers of solid<br>books--classics and textbcoks--whereas we are not. A 1957</p>
<p>Gallup Poll found that only one in six Americans was reading a</p>
<p>-w- /9</p>
<p>book. I have no figures on Russia, but in England over half the</p>
<p>population are pébk readers.</p>
<p>It is time we abandon fake alibis and recognize that<br>democracies are not invariably and automatically more deeply<br>concerned with educating their children than authoritarian<br>governments; and that since teaching French or algebra does not<br>lend itself to propaganda, we might well study more successful<br>teaching methods used abroad, even if they have been devised by |<br>nations whose form of government or way of life is distasteful<br>to us. Wild statements by educationists trying to minimize the<br>Russian educational menace by dwelling upon the different<br>role of the individual in totalitarian Russia as compared to<br>democratic America make the debate frustrating to all who wish to<br>sneppsuce the light of reason into educational dogmatism.</p>
<p>What effect does education have on the indivudual, and why<br>is the uneducated person less competent to perform his duties<br>as a citizen? . Before I answer this, let me say that to be<br>uneducated is of course not equivalent to being unintelligent-- |<br>indeed, it is my contention that many people who have mental |<br>ability remain uneducated because of the failure of schools to<br>educate them. An uneducated person may be intelligent or not,</p>
<p>a religious man or not, a good family man and helpful neighbor<br>or not, a person with pleasant manners and sensitivity to others</p>
<p>or not--these attributes have nothing to do with being educated.</p>
<p>Pas RO</p>
<p>Since only through education can we comprehend the world<br>around us, it follows that the uneducated are severly handicapped<br>in judging matters requiring a foundation of solid knowledge. In<br>a democracy the people rule and it is imperative that they be<br>educated enough to rule well. But, apart from lack of knowledge,</p>
<p>the uneducated individual who has passed through one of our</p>
<p>life-adjustment schools is likely to be deficient in subtler</p>
<p>ways: For one thing, his schooling will not have given him re</p>
<p>self-awareness, Since this is acquired through the process of<br>education itself, Through it the individual comes in contact<br>with great minds; he cannot help realizing that his own mind</p>
<p>4s inferior to theirs. He constantly meets objective tests</p>
<p>which show up his own limitations and assets. Out of this<br>experience comes self-awareness, the ability to stand off and<br>assess one&#x27;s capacities as if he were judging a stranger. One<br>is therefore less apt to meddle in things he cannot understand<br>than a person who has not been educated.</p>
<p>The uneducated tend to overvalue their own abilities, Never<br>having experienced the travail of obtaining an education, they<br>rarely understand how much one must know before one can handle ©<br>intricate problems. Bécause they feel as able as anyone else<br>to concern themselves with such problems, the uneducated may<br>delay important activities. Through their interference, they<br>may prevent others from doing vitally necessary work. The</p>
<p>wal.</p>
<p>core markt arpa AAZE</p>
<p>uneducated endanger democracy because their meddling and<br>interference render it inefficient; today our survival depends on<br>our being more efficient than the totalitarians.</p>
<p>Even persons who are competent in their particular field,<br>but otherwise deficient educationally, show the same tendency to<br>overvalue their capacity and to interject themselves into areas<br>where they lack competence. Administrators who are uneducated<br>in the whole field of science and technology are presently<br>delaying the building of our nuclear Navy by interfering in<br>technical matters, Many other important technical undertakings</p>
<p>are similarly delayed. Because of their influence, these persons</p>
<p>endanger democracy even more than does the ordinary uneducated<br>citizen who erroneously believes himself competent to handle —<br>matters that require more knowledge than he possesses; they<br>endanger democracy more because they are in the position to do<br>more to make 1t inefficient. | |<br>The schools must bear much of the blame for the insouciance<br>of our uneducated citizens. Future historians may well give<br>ominous significance to so simple a thing as the substitution<br>by proeredatve educationists of a new, so-called SNUX* oand.<br>for the old report card on which a child&#x27;s scholastic.<br>achievements were clearly marked A to F. The new card used letters<br>*N - More effort should be made</p>
<p>U ~- Unsatisfactory work<br>X - Needs special help</p>
<p>78-22</p>
<p>too but they now measured nothing. For example, the letter &quot;sg&quot;<br>stood for &quot;normal growth is taking place&quot; .and it went to the<br>bright boy who consistently solved all the questions in an exam;<br>it also went to the dullard who consistently failed to solve more<br>than a tiny fraction--both were growing &quot;normally&quot;.</p>
<p>Next in importance to self-awareness, which the educated<br>citizen usually acquires but the uneducated usually does not,<br>must be placed ability to view problems with intellectual<br>detachment. Such detachment is another by-product of genuine<br>education, which teaches young people to view truth as an<br>impersonal absolute good, regardless of the effect 1t may have<br>on them personally. To achieve such detachment is difficult,<br>and no one succeeds completely. Perhaps the liberally educated<br>individual and the truly great scientist come closest. We know<br>that great scientists,in particular, have such complete devotion<br>to truth that they will discard a lifetime&#x27;s work if they find<br>they have gone astray from the truth they seek; they will do<br>this even when they are in no danger of being found out, simply<br>because truth is more important to them than personal consideration.<br>People who regard truth as more important than their personal |<br>welfare are troublesome. They not only annoy everyone who has<br>a vested interest which truth would damage; they irritate the<br>uneducated who rarely feel that strongly about a principle, since.<br>they get it at second hand from persons they like.</p>
<p>798</p>
<p>To the uneducated, abstract ideas are unfamilar; so is the<br>Getachment that is necessary, out of one&#x27;s own knowledge and<br>mentel effort, to discover a truth. The uneducated person must<br>mecessarily view life in an intensely personal way~-he knows<br>only what he sees, hears, or touches and what he is told by<br>persons he likes. Detachment is possible for him only in the<br>form of total disinterest. Everything that interests him, he<br>personalizes. As the unknown sage puts its &quot;Great minds discuss<br>ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people&quot;,</p>
<p>How does the world look to the uneducated? It lacks the<br>clarity that comes when the torch of knowledge has illuminated<br>the world. To the uneducated, the world is hazy, haphazard,<br>and full of mysterious powers which he does not comprehend and, ~<br>therefore, fears; events impinge upon him singly, and he cannot<br>see their interconnections; he lacks the foundation of knowledge<br>without which opinions are worthless; his views tend to be<br>arbitrary surpori tions, emotionally determined guesses, or<br>parroted cliches. But above all, he differs from the educated<br>person in having no other way of observing people, events, and<br>issues than through his own Senses, nor of judging them except<br>by emotional preference. |</p>
<p>Disraeli once remarked that England was two nations--the<br>rich and the poor. Technology with its fantastic machine-made<br>productivity has all but fused the two, but technology with its</p>
<p>dependence on highly trained professional people to manage society<br>and push it forward has created a new division--that between the<br>educated and the uneducated. They are poles apart. The gap is<br>greatest between the uneducated person and the intellectual, in<br>particular the true scientist. | That is one reason why the</p>
<p>uneducated distrust and fear them. That is why there is popular -</p>
<p>dislike for the &quot;egghead&quot; and the &quot;brain&quot;, and general acceptance |</p>
<p>of that ridiculous stereotype of the &quot;cold&quot; scientist who cares ©</p>
<p>nothing for people but only for scientific laws. The uneducated</p>
<p>mistakes the scientist&#x27;s detachment in matters of seience for</p>
<p>lack of warmth In his human relations--a natural error for people</p>
<p>who cannot conceive of the world as anything but a PERSONAL world.<br>His personalizing of all issues makes the uneducated individual</p>
<p>the implacable enemy of critics. He carries his personal dislike</p>
<p>of being criticized--nagged at, he calls it--into the public arena;</p>
<p>instinctively, he will always favor the status quo,for he likes to<br>keep everything snug and running comfortably in accustomed grooves.<br>It is true that he doesn&#x27;t mind innovations in goods and services;<br>he is quickly persuaded by the nursery rhymes of the radic or TV<br>commercial which tell him that a new article is better than an</p>
<p>old one. But when it comes to new ideas, the uneducated shows<br>terrific sales resistance. Thinking comes much harder to him</p>
<p>than going out to buy a new product,</p>
<p>—_</p>

<p>In a democracy which depends upon popular decision in many<br>complicated matters, public debate is essential to the clarification<br>of issues. But debates will deteriorate into rancorous wrangling<br>when there is no meeting ground between those who represent opposite<br>views, This happens all too often when the uneducated confront<br>the educated. The former have no intellectual support for their<br>opinions and So cannot defend them rationally against adversaries<br>who argue on the basis of fact, knowledge, and reason, The<br>uneducated possess but one weapon--the lash of invective; they<br>eannot argue on the level of facts and ideas, so they stoop to<br>personal vilification, When a democracy has too many uneducated<br>citizens their very presence will tend to debase public debates<br>and turn them into personality contests. The uneducated will give<br>their vote to people who by their appearance and oratory most<br>closely approach a national ideal; they will vote for one or<br>another solution to a national problem on the basis of their<br>subjective liking for the person who advocates this solution.<br>Democracies can tolerete the conflict of groups pursuing<br>enlightened self-interest; but when self-interest is not<br>enlightened, it will destroy the nation.</p>
<p>One of the great dangers to society when it has too many<br>uneducated people is that their inability to view error with<br>intellectual detachment prevents early diagnosis of national</p>
<p>nletakes ,and quick remedial action. The truly educated man</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>can admit his mistakes without feeling that his personal worth<br>has been diminished; the uneducated man cherishes his mistakes<br>and grasps them with all the more determination when others<br>point them cut. To him the critic is an enemy who attacks<br>him by &quot;showing him up&quot;, This possessiveness about errers the<br>uneducated carry into public debates where they rise in anger<br>to defend national cliches, slogans, and illusions against<br>anyone who urges that these unsupported beliefs be ahandosed<br>and truth be faced. The uneducated has made these fancies his<br>own ,and they support him. |</p>
<p>To him the critic&#x27;s action, if not outright treason, is at</p>
<p>for which the attacker must be punished. “If you don&#x27;t like it<br>here, why don&#x27;t you go somewhere else?” This is his response to<br>the critic of any aspect of the American way of life. Proof of<br>love, to the uneducated, is that it finds no fault with what he<br>loves. Such is his own love for his children. He wants to make<br>life easy for them and give them all their hearts desire. They<br>are perfect as they are. Transposing this concept cf love to<br>a man&#x27;s feeling for his country, he accepts only unquestioning<br>approval of the status quo as evidence of real love; te question<br>its perfection, he feels, is disloyal.</p>
<p>Yet true devotion does not exclude criticism of the loved one.</p>
<p>As indulgence of children will stop them from growing to spiritual,</p>
<p>PAT</p>
<p>emotional, and intellectual maturity, so unwillin ess to criticize<br>the status quo will stop us from progressing and, convect our dynamic<br>society into a static one. When he vilifies the critic, the<br>uneducated person does not realize that, should he succeed, he<br>would destroy that very dynamism which is the essential<br>characteristic of Western civilization and the secret of its<br>superiority over other civilizations, not only in material<br>prosperity but also in compassion for those in need of help.</p>
<p>We have talked about American education long enough. It is<br>time we take steps to improve it so that prevailing misconceptions<br>of what the school should do will cease to keep our children<br>from becoming educated persons. Too many of our schools are<br>glittering workshops where the scholastic pursuit has become<br>marginal, and training is the essential goal. Let us turn them<br>4nto institutions devoted to education, with training given only<br>such marginal status as it has traditionally had---sewing for<br>the girls, perhaps. some mechanical training for the boys. Let<br>- stop our schools from diverting children from genuine education<br>to learning how to dress, shop, telephone, cook, Grive, or find<br>a mate. These skills may give them an attractive packaging, but<br>should we not be more concerned with giving our children solid<br>odntent? This cannot be done any other way than by lighting the</p>
<p>lamps of knowledge.</p>
<p>HIS</p>
<p>We must be clear in our minds that the educational debate now<br>going on turns on the basic question whether our tax supported<br>school system shall light these lamps or merely improve a child&#x27;s<br>outer shell and teach him some vocational skills. I myself, and<br>with me many other critics of American education, believe that<br>‘every child must be educated as far as 4s humanly pessible. Each<br>child must have at least one lamp lighted for him. Even though<br>4t be but one--or perhaps two or three--part of the world around<br>him will cease to be hazy, haphazard and controlled by mysterious<br>and fearsome powers. And as the world is illuminated for him, he<br>becomes to that extent educated. To bring this about is worth any<br>amount of effort and expenditure, both for the sake of the children</p>
<p>we cherish ,and of the country we love. _<br>a ae al</p>
