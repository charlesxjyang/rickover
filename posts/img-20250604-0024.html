      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document transcribes a March 26, 1969, House Armed Services Committee hearing focused on a critical retention crisis for nuclear-qualified submarine officers, a problem Admiral Hyman G. Rickover had long highlighted. The central issue is the severe shortage of these highly trained personnel, with figures indicating a 50% resignation rate in certain year groups, 370 total resignations, and an active manning requirement of over 1,400 officers against a total community of less than 2,000, compounded by an inadequate training pipeline (only 600 in training versus 950 needed). To address this, the committee considers H.R. 9328, a bill proposing special pay of up to $3,750 annually for officers agreeing to a four-year service extension, totaling up to $15,000, emphasizing the urgent need to retain these vital experts to ensure the continued manning of Polaris and nuclear attack submarines.</p>

<p>Houss or REPRESENTATIVES, ie \ ComMrIrrer on ARMED SERVICES, \Washington, D.C., Wednesday, March 26, 1969.</p>
<p>The committee met at 10:10 a.m., in room 2118, Rayburn Hou: Office Building, the Hon. L. Mendel Rivers, chairman of the con mittee, presiding.</p>
<p>The Crarrman. Let the committee come to order,</p>
<p>Before we begin our deliberations this morning, our distinguishe</p>
<p>\colleague from New Mexico has a very distinguished visitor he want</p>
<p>_/ to present to the committee.</p>
<p>I recognize Mr. Foreman of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman, Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>I have with us here in the hearing room this morning a very out standing young lady from Las Cruces, N. Mex., who was Mrs. Nev Mexico, and now she is Mrs. United States Savings Bond.</p>
<p>Her name is Mrs. Joy Berman. She is from Las Cruces. She ha been traveling around the United States—in fact, around the world— promoting United States Savings Bonds, and she has recently beet to Vietnam and Korea and other places, and I am pleased to have he here.</p>
<p>Will you please stand, Joy ? [ Applause. ]</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. We are so happy to have you, and we are so grate ful for the wonderful work you are doing.</p>
<p>I think the committee would be with one accord in my observa tion. You could be Miss United States, you wouldn’t need any other appellation. We are very happy to have you. We congratulate you or the fine work you are doing. It is such a worthy cause.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Foreman.</p>
<p>Mr. Fornman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Crarrman. Gentlemen, before we get started, our old and esteemed friend, Admiral] Rickover, has something he wants to say to the committee. | hes a</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, we would be very glad to hear from you.</p>
<p>98—066—69—_No. 7. 1 j ; note Sees</p>
<p>of the agreement by the Secretary or his designee, the total amount payable</p>
<p>shall become fixed and shall be paid in four equal yearly installments, com- _peneing at the expiration of the initial obligated. service; except, the Secretary</p>
<p>‘or his designee may accept the active-service agreement not more than one year in advance of the expiration of the initial obligated active service and the amount may then be paid in five yearly installments, not to exceed $3,000 per year, commencing with the date of acceptance of the agreement.</p>
<p>“(b) No more than one agreement for each officer shall be accepted under this section.</p>
<p>“(¢) Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy and subject to such exceptions as may be prescribed in those regulations, refunds, on a pro rata basis, of sums paid pursuant to this section may be required if the officer having received the payment fails to complete the full period of four years of active submarine service which he agreed to serve.</p>
<p>“(d) Nothing in this section shall alter or modify the obligation of a regular officer to perform active service at the pleasure of the President. Completion of the additional period of four years’ active submarine service under this sec- tion shall in no way obligate the President to accept a resignation submitted by a regular officer at the end of the four-year period.</p>
<p>“(e) The provisions of this section shall be effective only in the case of officers who, on or before June 30, 1973, execute the required written agreement to remain in active service.”</p>
<p>(2) by inserting the following new item in the analysis: «312. Special pay ; nuclear-qualified submarine officers extending period of active service.”</p>
<p>Now, this is a long statement/we have here, and I want you to pay close attention to it, and I will ask Mr. Slatinshek to read it, and I will ask you to pay very careful attention to it.</p>
<p>We wrote this, and I will have something to say when Mr. Slatinshek has completed his reading of it.</p>
<p>I think we are guilty—and this goes for the Navy too—of reacting to conditions that we should have anticipated. We should have antie-</p>
<p>_fpated this, and let’s start a new era of not sitting down waiting for</p>
<p>somebody to hit us before we start these things.</p>
<p>T think Admiral Rickover has been a voice crying in the wilderness on lots of these things.</p>
<p>You, too Admiral Duncan. I know what you have done about things like this.</p>
<p>But we have a new manpower team now. I know of no better one to head it than General Hittle. It shows how they are meeting these prob- lems head on, and that is the only way to do this, and for this we want to thank you and congratulate you.</p>
<p>But let’s see if we can’t plan this morning to avoid these crises, which are inevitable, if we don’t see them. And there are others coming just like this; let’s get ready for them.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Mr. Slatinshek.</p>
<p>Mr. SLatinsiex. This isthe chairman’s statement, and I read:</p>
<p>Our principal purpose in meeting today is to consider H.R. 9328, a bill which, if enacted into law, will authorize the Secretary of the Navy to pay a substantial monetary bonus to certain nuclear trained sub- marine officers who voluntarily extend their period of obligated service. - Tand other Members of the Congress have for the past several months been concerned over disquieting rumors that the Navy was experienc- ing genuine difficulty in retaining nuclear-trained submarine officers. Subsequent inquiries made by me revealed that there was indeed a serious problem which could, among other things, preclude us from ade- quately manning our Polaris submarines.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Chairman, I have here a gavel which made from wood from the U.S.S. Constitution. I know of no on whom it would be more appropriate to present this than to you, cause the Constitution was made of oak, and I believe your attit is one which reflects the firm oak tree, which is protecting our cc try. And therefore I would like to present this to you for all the thi you have done for the United States.</p>
<p>T know that as a Congressman you, with all other Members of C gress, must look out for your district. If you didn’t, you woul: come back here. Every Congressman has to do that.</p>
<p>But on top of that, you have preeminently in your mind the wel: of the United States, and you also know the first duty of a legislatc to protect his country and keep it alive. It is in this spirit I would to present this gavel.</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. Thank you very much, Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>Admiral, I certainly accept this in the spirit in which it was gi and surely by the magnificent and gracious remarks which actu: your bringing it here.</p>
<p>I accept it for myself, in great appreciation, but I accept it too the committee, for the things for which this committee stands, and backing they are always giving the program of this committee whe is outlined by our policy committee.</p>
<p>I shan’t take this home, but I will leave it in this committee rc remembering your words. We must be sturdy in these times, like Constitution of the United States, and the ship from which this g was made. We will cherish this and we will preserve this, and it remain with the committee.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we are convened this morning for the purpose of | sidering H.R. 9828.</p>
<p>[H.R. 9328, 91st Cong., first sess.]</p>
<p>A BILL To amend title 37, United States Code, to provide special pay to naval | qualified in submarines, who have the current technical quslifvation for duty fe nection with supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion, p) who agree to remain in active submarine service for one period of four years be any other obligated active service, and for other punposes.</p>
<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United &amp; of America in Congress assembled, That chapter 5 of title 37, United States ( is amended—</p>
<p>, (1) by adding the following new section : $312. Special pay: nuclear-qualified submarine officers extending perio active service</p>
<p>“(a) Under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy officer of the naval service who— : :</p>
<p>“(1) is entitled to basic pay ; (2) is currently designated ‘qualified in submarines’ ; “(3) has the current technical qualification for duty in connection supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion ple (4) has not completed ten years of commissioned service; and “(5) executes a written agreement to remain in active submarine 8 for one period of four years in addition to any other period of oblis active service, may, upon the acceptance by the Secretary or his designee of the written a: ment, in addition to all other compensation to which he is entitled, be pe sum of money not to exceed $3,750 for each year of the active-service agreer The Secretary of the Navy shall determine semiannually the necessity for tinuance of the special pay and the rate of special pay per year for such ac service agreements accepted within each six-month period. Upon. accept</p>
<p>The Navy, as of early February 1969, had in hand a ‘total of 370</p>
<p>_esignations from regular, nuclear trained submarine officers, plus 44</p>
<p>scheduled releases from Active Duty Reserve officers. Resignation rates from these nuclear trained officers in year groups 1961 through 1964 approach, 50 percent, with new resignation requests being received at a rate of approximately 30 per month.</p>
<p>The Navy tells me that 300 nuclear submarine officers are scheduled for release from active duty in calendar year 1960, and if present resignation deferral policy (1-year delay) were relaxed, at least 100 more would be released.</p>
<p>This alarming resignation rate becomes more meaningful when we realize that most of these resignations are coming from relatively junior officers who represent the only possible source for future depart- ment heads and commanding officers for our nuclear attack and Polaris submarines.</p>
<p>These are the circumstances which have resulted in the legislative proposal which we have before us today. It is not the only action being</p>
<p>taken by the Navy to cope with this problem, but it represents, in the -</p>
<p>judgment of the executive branch, the most expeditious and meaningful short-term solution to the retention problem.</p>
<p>In addition to requesting approval of authority to provide a con- tinuation pay bonus to nuclear-trained submarine officers, the Chief of Naval Operations, after meeting with his subordinate commanders and the Chief of Naval Personnel, has initiated a number of other</p>
<p>administrative actions which hopefully will somewhat alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>Among the steps taken are an effort to reduce substantially the ad- ministrative burdens and paperwork heretofore confronting officers in the nuclear program, as well as an intensified recruiting effort to secure new qualified applicants for the program.</p>
<p>Our witnesses today can, of course, elaborate on these efforts made by the Navy.</p>
<p>The bill before us would provide the Secretary of the Navy with authority to pay a continuation pay bonus to nuclear qualified sub- marine officers who have not completed 10 years of commissioned service, and who agree to voluntarily extend their period of active service.</p>
<p>The bonus will ordinarily be payable to these nuclear submarine officers upon completion of their first sea tour—in return for a 4-year active service commitment. The bonus, however, will be payable to every nuclear-qualified submarine officer with less than 10 years of commissioned service providing he had agreed to remain in the active submarine service for one period of 4 years beyond his obligated perod of service. The bonus can in no case exceed $3,750 for each year of the active service agreement, with a maximum therefore of $15,000 for the 4-year period.</p>
<p>The bill provides that this authority “shall be effective only in the case of officers who, on or before June 30, 1973, execute the required written agreement to remain in active service.” In other words, unless</p>
<p>_yve in the Congress act to extend the availability of this authority</p>
<p>The Navy is now acutely conscious of this problem and thered has initiated a number of actions which hopefully will alleviate | problem. Included among these actions is the decision to ask Cong: to authorize the payment of a special monetary bonus to retain nucl trained submarine officers who voluntarily extend their period obligated service.</p>
<p>The current nuclear submarine officer manning problem is a proc</p>
<p>of both inadequate input into the program combined with insuffic retention of trained personnel. These factors result in a decrease trained officer inventory, while ship manning requirements continu increase. _ The nuclear submarine officer community is relatively small, cons ing of fewer than 2,000 officers. Of these, approximately 1,950 offic 1,850 are in the grade of commander and lesser grades, and there: are of appropriate seniority for continued. service in nuclear : marines. Approximately 950 of these officers are in the grade lieutenant.</p>
<p>These officers currently man and operate 82 Polaris crews</p>
<p>SSBN’s), and 47 nuclear attack (SSN) submarine crews. Nine n SSN’s will be manned prior to June 30, 1970, requiring additi: personnel. _ The manning of these nuclear powered submarines requires ar imum of 11 nuclear-trained submarine officers per crew. Thus, n than 1,400 officers are required to actively man the nuclear pow submarines presently in our inventory, leaving very few officers assignment to hard core shore and staff billets'as well as refresher ty ing 1n the program.</p>
<p>Moreover, this very austere inventory of trained officers precl: the Navy from providing this officer community with the norma: to shore rotation opportunity that is afforded their surface con poraries. This circumstance alone contributes heavily to the ‘cur retention problem. For example, there are officers in this program have not been assigned to a shore billet in more than 18 years—a t incredible situation.</p>
<p>The nuclear submarine program because of its sophistication highly technical nature requires officers of the highest possible cal These officers, all volunteers, once accepted into the program, are g intensive specialized training in both nuclear propulsion as we submarine training. The total training period encompasses a peric approximately 2 years.</p>
<p>T am told that despite the best efforts of the Navy, it has heretc been unable to achieve the necessary input into the training pip of approximately 475 officers each year .Thus, the current 2-year t ing pipeline has an inventory of only 600 officers in training, wher requirement of 950 (475 per year) is necessary to insure mainten of adequate qualified officer inventories.</p>
<p>As I had previously indicated, the inability of the Navy to ol enough qualified volunteers for training in the nuclear program - coupled with a drastic decrease in the retention rate, has now res in the problem we are discussing today:</p>
