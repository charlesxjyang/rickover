      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1980 address, Admiral H.G. Rickover issues a sobering warning about the escalating Soviet naval threat, highlighting their massive shipbuilding program of over 1800 new ships and combatant craft since 1958, including building more than nine times the number of major combatants as the U.S. in the preceding decade. Rickover argues that since the U.S. cannot match Soviet numerical superiority (who possess almost three times as many submarines and five construction yards to the U.S.&#x27;s two), it must prioritize qualitative superiority, primarily through nuclear propulsion. He advocates for continued investment in faster, more capable nuclear attack submarines (like the SSN688 class), emphasizing their operational necessity over cheaper, less capable alternatives. He also champions the Trident ballistic missile submarine program for its increased survivability and ability to eliminate reliance on foreign bases, and calls for nuclear-powered AEGIS cruisers to provide crucial air defense with superior mobility and reduced logistical dependence in high-threat areas. Finally, Rickover underscores the critical challenge of retaining experienced, nuclear-trained naval personnel and the indispensable role of strong Congressional support in ensuring national defense and survival.</p>

        <p>Remarks by admiral h- g- rickover before the 95th republican club thursday, 4 september 1980</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>] appreciate the opportunity to meet with you-</p>
<p>I will not dwell on the specifics of the naval nuclear propulsion program | AM responsible for because | have testified on that subject before several congressional committees- [ want to talk on the importance</p>
<p>Of the soviet naval threat as compared to our naval strength+</p>
<p>The soviet naval threat</p>
<p>Soviet agression in afghanistan has brought renewed realization of soviet intentions for world power and concern for the adequacy of our own defense+ what many may not realize is that the soviet threat in naval power, as in other areas, has been growing more ominous- past warnings by many in the military have been greeted with some indifference- however, today we are faced with a naval threat more serious than any</p>
<p>Since world war [I].</p>
<p>Since 1958, the soviets have built over 1800 new ships and combatant craft, a program of naval expansion that surpasses the efforts of any other naval power- from a defensive fleet in world war II, it has evolved into a major bluewater navy that challenges the U-S. For control</p>
<p>Almost everywhere in the world. The soviet momentum for superiority in</p>
<p>Naval warfare continues while U-S- naval plans fluctuate every year- never in peacetime has there been anything comparable to the growth of russian naval power- this certainly raises concern over the soviet</p>
<p>Desire to maintain the peace-</p>
<p>Here are some comparative examples to illustrate these concerns-</p>
<p>0 in the past 10 years the soviets have built over 900 major and minor surface combatants, mine warfare, and amphibious ships, while the U-S- has built 100, or just over 10 percent</p>
<p>As many»</p>
<p>0 the soviets have more major surface combatants than we, and are introducing new ships at a greater rate- these include 4 new classes of cruisers, one of which will likely be nuclear powered: at about 22,000 tons, it would be the world's largest nuclear powered cruiser and will carry a formidable array of</p>
<p>Weapons +</p>
<p>) the soviets have almost 3 times as many submarines and one-</p>
<p>Third more nuclear submarines-</p>
<p>) they have 5 submarine construction yards; we have two- all ues- submarine construction capacity could fit into one soviet</p>
<p>Submarine yard-</p>
<p>) since 1970, they have introduced 10 new submarine designs;</p>
<p>The U-S- two- during this period, the soviets have put to sea</p>
<p>More new design submarines than any other country during a</p>
<p>Comparable period in all of naval history-</p>
<p>0 their program has strong support and virtually unlimited fundings they are striving for qualitative superiority= they already have numerical superiority our program is uncertain and does not get strong support from the defense</p>
<p>Department -</p>
<p>Ed to maintain a viable U-S- flee</p>
<p>Any comparison of the soviet and U-S- navy must be viewed from the context that we are a maritime power dependent upon being able to maintain sea lanes of communication necessary to conduct military operations overseas and to support our allies- jhe mission of our navy is a far more difficult one than that of the soviets of denying US free use of</p>
<p>The seas-</p>
<p>We have given up any chance of matching the soviet navy in number of ships. Therefore, the quality of our ships must be superior- it is axiomatic that a nation dependent on the quality of its weapons must design its forces around an offensive strategy if it is to prevail over a numerically superior foe- it cannot afford to fight a defensive war</p>
<p>Of attrition&gt;</p>
<p>Fed for flexible and capable sh</p>
<p>A few years ago, few people gave much thought to deploying naval</p>
<p>Forces to the indian ocean to protect our interests- today that has</p>
<p>Become a reality- few appreciate how difficult it is to maintain a significant naval force half way around the world- the supply line, particularly for oil fired ships, is tenuous- there may be a new realization that war of attrition at sea is a real possibility&gt; in these circumstances, our naval forces must be able to defend the sea lanes and carry the</p>
<p>Battle to the enemy as well- in a global wartime situation we will not</p>
<p>Have time to build the complex ships we need the way we did in the</p>
<p>Last world war- the ships we build in peacetime are those we will have</p>
<p>To rely upon in the event of hostilities-</p>
<p>If we miscalculate or succumb to the easy economic choice of putting off decisions, and do not build ships adequate to face the threat, our choice will be to either give in to our enemies or resort to nuclear war+ the cost of adequate strength to ensure peace is small</p>
<p>Compared to the cost of war-</p>
<p>Current issues</p>
<p>I will now comment specifically on several current issues related</p>
<p>To the strength and capability of our naval forces-</p>
<p>1. The attack submarine issue whether we will build enough highly capable nuclear powered attack</p>
<p>Submarines to meet the navy’s minimum needs remains unsettled-</p>
<p>After a series of hearings, the seapower subcommittee of the house armed services committee issued a report in december 1979 recommending</p>
<p>An increased attack submarine building rate to keep the force level up,</p>
<p>And recommending that the navy proceed with building improved SSN688 los angeles class submarines-</p>
<p>Yet a mixed attack submarine force of some slower and some faster units continues to be studied by the systems analysts- even though all the studies show that the faster, more capable submarines are more cost effective over their lifetime in postulated &quot;operations scenarios,” the defense department continues to press for building cheaper, less</p>
<p>Capable submarines to save on initial costs-</p>
<p>The arguments for reducing cost by building new, less capable attack submarines are specious- with our limited submarine force level, the normal process of aging will give US a mixed force, with some submarines becoming less capable as they get older- all of the submarine designers and operators support the more capable attack submarine- recent operations have provided actual evidence of the superior capability of the faster los angeles class submarines. Even commanders in the fleet who are not</p>
<p>Submariners recognize this advantage-</p>
<p>Let me give you a few examples of what it would mean to reduce the speed of a new attack submarine by 5 knots below the attainable</p>
<p>Speed of a los angeles class submarine as is being suggested:</p>
<p>0 the slower U-S- submarines would be unable to keep up with</p>
<p>And attack most soviet nuclear attack submarines»</p>
<p>Ie) the slower U-S- submarines would be unable 10 stay with and</p>
<p>Attack high speed surface ships-</p>
<p>The slower U-S- submarines would be unable to escort U.S.</p>
<p>Surface ships in high speed operations-</p>
<p>0 the slower U-S. Submarines would require an extra day and a half to transit the atlantic- in a day and a half, a nuclear</p>
<p>Attack submarine could search an area the size of new england-</p>
<p>In addition, numerous exercises have demonstrated that nuclear attack submarines are superior to all other ASW weapon systems- the rapid buildup of the soviet submarine fleet shows that the need for ASW capability is increasing- I know of no breakthroughs in ASW technology</p>
<p>That have effectively countered the soviet submarine threat:</p>
<p>Some systems analysts advocate building less capable submarines to perform less demanding missions- jhe fallacy here is that we cannot know in advance exactly what mission a given submarine will be called upon to perform in a real war- unlike other weapons, the attack submarine fights its battles alone and with little external support- under such</p>
<p>Circumstances, limited mission submarines are not suited to our needs-</p>
<p>The defense department posture to press for some cheaper, less capable submarines to save initial construction costs is being pushed by those in positions of authority who do not really understand submarine operations: for example, even though the current minimum force level of sq attack submarine is lower than desired, the submarine operators have said that they would prefer fewer, more capable attack submarines if</p>
<p>That is what it would take to get the best ones- \</p>
<p>This matter will ultimately have to be settled by congress- the congress has already taken positive action in the FY8] defense authorization bill by authorizing two SSN688 class attack submarines and long lead</p>
<p>Funds for three SSN688 class submarines in FY82 and two more in FY85-</p>
<p>It also deleted all long lead funds for a slower, less capable attack submarine, and included advance funds for an improved SSN688 class submarine design- continued strong support by congress will be needed</p>
<p>To assure that this action is sustained-</p>
<p>2+ ijrident</p>
<p>Turning now to the ballistic missile submarines, the FY8]1 shipbuilding program includes a ninth TRIDENT submarine- these submarines will have increased survivability compared to our existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines because they are being built with all the latest technology- they will be more difficult to detect than existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines because they will be quieter, and their longer range missiles will give them 10 to 20 times more ocean area in which to hide- our existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines are noisy compared to present standards- they were all built with the technology of the 1950's. Quieter submarines are necessary to decrease the probability of detection</p>
<p>And to ensure survivability of our seaborne strategic deterrent-</p>
<p>The longer range of the TRIDENT missiles will permit basing our ballistic missile submarines in the U-S- -~ no foreign basing will be required- this will eliminate the vulnerability of our ballistic missile submarine force to international political action that could deny US use</p>
<p>Of foreign bases- this is essential because we are always in danger of</p>
<p>Losing our foreign bases-</p>
<p>I consider the TRIDENT program vital to our national survival-</p>
<p>Continued congressional support will be needed.</p>
<p>3. Need for nuclear powered AEGIS cruisers</p>
<p>For the past several years, navy witnesses have testified that the AEGIS system is needed to protect our surface ships against the projected soviet air threat in the 1980's. These ships would be key elements in providing sophisticated air defense for our aircraft carrier strike forces against enemy missiles- present navy plans are to build a</p>
<p>Number of oil fired, gas turbine powered AEGIS fleet defense ships, the cg 47 class.</p>
<p>I consider that AEGIS ships should be nuclear powered for the same reasons that aircraft carriers need to be nuclear powered -- reasons that have been dramatically demonstrated recently in the indian ocean- the AEGIS is planned as our most capable anti-air warfare weapons system- because they will be expensive, regardless of their means of propulsion, there will never be a large number- in a naval war against an enemy employing sophisticated weapon systems, AEGIS ships will be needed in the areas of highest threat- under such circumstances, the advantages of nuclear propulsion are needed for maximum mobility and minimum logistic support+ the nuclear powered carriers will be employed in high threat</p>
<p>Areas and they will need nuclear powered AEGIS ships to accompany them.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that tankers can survive in areas where the threat is great enough to require first line naval strike forces- when a non-</p>
<p>Nuclear AEGIS ship runs low on fuel, it will have to retreat to an area</p>
<p>Of lower threat to meet a tanker, losing the AEGIS system’s protection just when it is most needed- unless nuclear powered AEGIS cruisers are built, our nuclear carriers will have to be accompanied by conventionally powered AEGIS ships when they enter the highest threat areas- this would constrain the task group to the logistics limitations of the oil fired, gas turbine powered cruisers, thus sacrificing the significant military advantages of the all-nuclear carrier task force in the very areas where</p>
<p>These advantages are most needed-</p>
<p>Life cycle cost comparisons of nuclear and conventional warships compare peacetime costs, and assume that carrier task forces can be safely replenished wherever they may be- if the cost of providing the carrier task forces with the ability to conduct replenishment operations in areas subject to the soviet naval threat of the 1980'S were used, the overall cost of nuclear powered surface warships would be shown to be</p>
<p>Less than that of non-nuclear ships-</p>
<p>In the 1980's and beyond, in any areas where the soviets challenge US, we will need all-nuclear carrier task forces to be able to keep our sea lanes of communication open- aircraft carriers and AEGIS fleet air defense ships will be the principal elements of these naval strike forces which must be capable of fighting in areas of highest threat- considering the difficulties of providing logistic support in such areas, our aircraft carriers and AEGIS warships should be given the</p>
<p>Mobility and flexibility that only nuclear propulsion can provide-</p>
<p>4. Ntlon of experienced personnel</p>
<p>I want to mention one other important current problem with respect to our defense readiness- you have heard about the lack of qualified personnel in our armed forces. We cannot solve the problem by just bringing in more new people- we must retain more men after their first and second tours- retention of experienced, nuclear-trained officers and men is the most critical problem facing the nuclear navy as well as the rest of the navy- the problem is so acute we may have to tie up some of our nuclear powered ships for lack of trained, experienced</p>
<p>People- civilian industry is luring these people away at a high rate-</p>
<p>The key to improved retention with our all-volunteer military is adequate pay and benefits. Jhe navy can never compete equally with civilian industry, but the pay gap can be closed so we can retain highly</p>
<p>Qualified men in whom the navy has so large a training investment-</p>
<p>A number of relief measures are currently being considered by the</p>
<p>Congress: strong support by the congress is needed for these measures-</p>
<p>Closing comments</p>
<p>I have provided my thoughts from a vantage point of being involved in our nation's defense for a long time and in charge of the nuclear propulsion program since its inception over years ago- from that perspective, I AM particularly sensitive to the role that the congress has played- without repeated congressional actions and help throughout the years, we simply would not, today, have the strong nuclear fleet we</p>
<p>Have, now representing over 40% of the navy’s major combatants- you</p>
<p>Have the constitutional responsiblity to maintain this nation's ability to defend itself- indeed no other national issue is more critical than national defense- if we are not able to prevail against our enemies,</p>
<p>All other issues, however significant, become irrelevant- it is to the</p>
<p>Congress that we all must look for a defense posture strong enough to</p>
<p>Assure our survival as a nation-</p>
