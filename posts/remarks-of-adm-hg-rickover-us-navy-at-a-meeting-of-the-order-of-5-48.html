      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a 1979 address to the &quot;Order of 5-48&quot; at the Rayburn House Office Building, Admiral H.G. Rickover delivered a sharp critique of federal government management, attributing a pervasive lack of public trust to the rise of abstract &quot;modern management&quot; techniques and a disproportionate number of &quot;managers and checkers&quot; over &quot;doers.&quot; Drawing on over 50 years of government service, Rickover advocates for a return to fundamental principles: fostering genuine &quot;ownership&quot; and long-term commitment to one&#x27;s job, ensuring singular &quot;responsibility&quot; instead of diffused accountability, demanding meticulous &quot;attention to detail,&quot; disciplined &quot;prioritization,&quot; and a direct understanding of operations rather than relying on &quot;management information systems.&quot; He emphasizes the necessity of &quot;hard work,&quot; independent &quot;checking up&quot; for quality control, &quot;formality&quot; in communications for historical record, and the courage to &quot;face the facts&quot; and implement difficult changes, warning that a failure to adopt these tangible actions could lead to an escalating &quot;taxpayers revolt.&quot;</p>

<p>REMARKS OF DE Livéay Aow H.G. Ricxover, U.S. Navy _ Copy Ar A MEETING OF THE “ORDER OF 5-48” ON 15 Noverper 1979</p>
<p>Today the american people have little trust in those who work for the federal government. To an extent this lack of confidence is justified, particularly when it involves senior managers, since the end of world war it the number of high grade civilians in relation to the total government workforce has steadily increased to the point where we have more managers and checkers than we have doers. This increase has been brought about by the purveyors of the “techniques</p>
<p>This “new” philosophy which holds that as long as a person is well~ versed in a few simple rules of how to handle people and situations, he need not know anything about the details of the programs he is managing or the increasingly sophisticated technologies on which many of these programs are based, this has allowed the non-profes- sional to achieve high status and high pay within the government, these “managers” can move easily from one position to another without the slightest pause. As long as their area does not become a public disaster they are safe. If trouble erupts, they are lost; they can then blame those beneath them or those who preceded them. Until</p>
<p>I do not hold much hope for this being done before a major disaster befalls the united states. But I can provide some basic principles for doing a job that I have followed for over 50 years of government service and which | have instilled in my senior managers, if these principles were emphasized instead of the present ones, it would go a long way toward reversing the current trend, unfortunately, many of those who have been brought up in the “new management” system will probably never understand the significance of the principles I offer,</p>
<p>A person doing a job—any job—must feel that he owns it and that he will remain on that job indefinitely. If he feels he is a temporary custodian, or is using the job as a stepping stone to a higher position, his actions will probably not take into account the long-term interests of the country. Lack of commitment to the present job will be perceived by those who work for himjand they also will tend not to care. If he feels he owns his job and acts accord- ingly, he need not worry about his next job. He should exercise a devotion to his work as if his children were the direct beneficiaries of what he is doing, as indeed they are. 00 many spend their entire lives looking for the next job. We need to make it challenging and rewarding for managers to remain in one organization for more than a few years, thereby the organization will benefit from their knowledge, experience, and “corporate” memory. |</p>
<p>Responsible, attention to detai|</p>
<p>A tendency among managers, particularly as they move to higher positions, is to think they no longer need to be concerned with details, if the boss is not concerned about details, his subordinates also will not consider them important. Yet &quot;the devil is in the details.” it is</p>
<p>Would rather focus on lofty ml icy matters. But when the details are ignored, the project fails; no influsion of policy or lofty ideals can then correct the situation, this principle is particularly important in those programs where the application of special skills or technology</p>
<p>Priorities the need to pay attention to details does not mean that you should</p>
<p>On any given day, small, unimportant but seemingly “interesting” trivia pass through an office; you must avoid letting these monopolize your time, a tendency of human beings is to while away time with unimportant matters because these do not require mental effort,or energy, this is why television is popular, you must apply self-discipline to ensure your energy is focused on where it is most needed,</p>
<p>Ow | S going on</p>
<p>You must establish simple and direct means to find out what is going onin detail) in the area of your responsibility, there are ways of doing this, but all involve constant drudgery. For this reason most managers avoid keeping up with details; instead they create &quot;management information systems.” gimmicks such as these merely demonstrate you are incapable or unwilling to use the necessary effort on your job,</p>
<p>I require regular, periodic reports directly to me from key personnel throughout my program, I insist that they report the problems they have found in plain english, and that they report the specific action they are taking, and what assistance they need from me, the concept that the use of complex systems can simplify matters is specious, it may sound attractive but it flies in the face of nature's laws, as | have observed them,</p>
<p>Hard work for this there is no substitute, a manager who does not work hard or devote extra effort can not expect his people to do so. You</p>
<p>Must set the example, harp work compensates for many shortcomings, you may not be the smartest or most knowledgeable person, but if you dedicate yourself to the job and put in the required effort, your people will follow your lead,</p>
<p>An essential element of carrying out my work is the need to have it checked by an independent source, even the most dedicated individual makes mistakes, further, many are less than fully dedicated to their work. In industry an independent check is usually referred to as “quality control” and is widely used in engineering applications, but the concept is valid for more than just engineering, much poor work and sheer nonsense is generated in government because it is not subjected to impartial review and oversight,</p>
<p>A corollary of the concept of checking work is in the need for formalizing communications and actions, if this is not done, then one is dependent on individual memory, which is quickly lost as people leave or move to other jobs. In my work an invaluable feature has been the ability to go back a number of years to determine the basis for an action. In this way an emerging problem can be put into proper perspective, and can facilitate taking the action needed for correction, if actions are not formalized, one can never be sure they are under- stood or executed,</p>
<p>If conditions require it, one must face the facts and brutally make needed changes despite considerable costs and schedule delays, the man in charge must personally set the example in this area and require subordinates to do likewise, figuratively, he must, if neces~ sary, kill his own child, regardless of the consequences to himself. After all, he is the trustee for the government; he is not the owner,</p>
<p>The principles I have stated have many ancillary facets that can be further developed. I have merely provided the key elements, I suspect most of those here today will give passing acknowledgment and may even agree with the principles. But unless tangible action is taken to put them into practice, they have been of no merit, there is a desperate need in government for responsible management; for managers who pay attention to substance and not to glib &quot;management techniques.” if there continues to be little movement toward more responsible and effective management along the lines I have outlined, it should come as no surprise if the &quot;taxpayers revolt” takes on an increasingly tangible</p>
