      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his June 1, 1976, remarks accepting the Distinguished American Award from the Baltimore City Bar Association, Admiral Hyman Rickover delivers an unflinching assessment of the declining moral standards across professions, particularly the legal field. Citing a 1973 Harris Poll showing only 18% public confidence in law firms, Rickover asserts that lawyers have contributed to the nation&#x27;s moral decay—highlighted by revelations since Watergate—prioritizing profit over societal duty and failing to ensure justice. He challenges the audience to reclaim their ethical responsibilities, invoking historical wisdom from Solon and Justice Brandeis, quoting Vermont C. Royster on &quot;moral myopia,&quot; and urging individual lawyers to act as &quot;patriots&quot; to restore integrity to the law and serve the nation, rather than remaining silent in the face of widespread systemic failures and the unequal application of justice.</p>

        <p>_— FOR RELEASE 7:30 P, M, (EDT)<br>i TUESDAY, JUNE 1, 1976</p>
<p>Remarks on Acceptance of the<br>Distinguished American Award<br>Presented by<br>The Bar Association of Baltimore City<br>Baltimore, Maryland<br>June 1, 1976<br>Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Baltimore Bar, and Guests:</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be here tonight, and an honor to receive the<br>Distinguished American Award. During my nearly 60 years of service<br>in the Navy, I have never sought to be popular but to do my best. I have<br>tried to develop effective and reliable ships. In addition to my official<br>duties, I have tried to improve our educational system ;and to challenge</p>
<p>our citizens to think and live above their personal lives. I will count</p>
<p>tonight a success if but one person present is influenced by what I say</p>
<p>and takes action to improve the state of the legal profession.</p>
<p>Today we are a troubled nation; a nation as much in need of patriots<br>as 200 years ago. Our professions, including the legal profession, are<br>being questioned. It was not always so. When I was a young man, three<br>professional groups were held in high esteem—ministers, doctors, and<br>lawyers.</p>
<p>Clergymen represented the Lord to man. Theology was considered</p>
<p>the highest of all professions as it had been since the Middle Ages when it</p>
<p>was known as &#x27;&#x27;The Queen of the Sciences. &quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>Doctors were considered to be men who cared about their patients</p>
<p>as people. For them, the Hippocratic Oath was a guide to live by, not<br>just a plaque on the office wall.</p>
<p>Lawyers were seen as learned men, officers of the court, whose<br>function it was to see that justice was done so that society could function<br>smoothly. They provided a civilized way to resolve disputes.</p>
<p>Today these three professions are not respected as they were in<br>the days of my youth.</p>
<p>Theology no longer attracts the caliber of men it once did. Espousing<br>social causes and situation ethics, too many ministers seem to be justifying<br>that which it is not possible to justify, rather than calling men to live by<br>godly standards and obey eternal laws.</p>
<p>Nearly all doctors once served selflessly; strikes in that profession<br>were unthinkable. Today many doctors appear to be interested primarily<br>in making money.</p>
<p>And what of lawyers? You must be aware of the public&#x27;s opinion of<br>your profession. A 1973 Harris Poll found only 18 percent to have<br>confidence in law firms. This rated you lower than businessmen, police,<br>or garbage collectors.</p>
<p>No one questions the need for law and lawyers. The true function<br>of a lawyer is not to exploit legal and adversary advantages but to promote</p>
<p>compromise and reconciliation. Without law, there can be no civilization.</p>
<p>The law is an instrument to serve society. Real protection in this world</p>
<p>comes not from people&#x27;s good intentions but from law.</p>
<p>But the law is not self-executing. It is embodied in the lives and<br>actions of lawyers and judges. When its execution rests in the hands of<br>those who are not faithful to it, we lose respect for lawyers and the law.<br>This loss tears at the fabric of society and tempts the public to seek<br>justice outside the law.</p>
<p>During and since World War II, I have been closely associated with<br>businessmen and their lawyers. I have been responsible for contracts<br>running into many hundreds of millions of dollars. Having observed<br>Government lawyers and those in private practice, I speak from personal<br>experience when I say that lawyers have been involved in the moral decay</p>
<p>of America—-both within business and Government. |</p>
<p>Look at some of the revelations since Watergate. Does anyone</p>
<p>believe that corporation lawyers know nothing of their companys&#x27; wrongful</p>
<p>acts? And in Government, lawyers have more positions of power than any<br>other profession. Whatever our Government is or is not, can partly be<br>laid at the feet of your profession. Fifty years ago Justice Brandeis<br>warned against misconduct in government. He said: &quot;Our government is<br>the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the<br>whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the government</p>
<p>becomes a law-breaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man</p>
<p>to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.&quot;</p>
<p>In Athens, 600 years before the Christian era, Solon was asked:</p>
<p>&quot;How can we have Justice in Athens ?&quot;&quot; His answer was: &quot;Justice can be<br>had in Athens whenever those who have not suffered injustice are as</p>
<p>outraged as those who have.&quot;</p>
<p>Vermont C. Royster, in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, had</p>
<p>some pungent thoughts; I will quote a few:</p>
<p>&quot;Among recent scandals is the revelation of the lack of a sense<br>of ethics displayed by so many lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet the shock was not so much that some lawyers deliberately<br>violate the law. Their behavior was not that of the intentionally<br>dishonest man. Rather it arose from a moral myopia that led them<br>to do things without seeing any ethical questions at all.</p>
<p>&quot;The danger is that every society, from the most primitive to<br>the most advanced, depends for its survival on an accepted moral<br>base. Destroying the gods of Rome destroyed Rome. In primitive<br>tribes the invasion by modern civilization first corrupts and then<br>destroys the tribe.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason is that the social fabric is all of one piece. As in<br>the civil law when one part is flouted the binding power of all law<br>is diminished; so it is with moral injunctions. Without a sense that<br>some things are wrong simply because they are wrong—without a<br>sense of sin—every man is cast adrift. Not just the young; also the<br>lawyer, doctor or public servant has no inner standard to measure<br>whether what he does is ethical or unethical. Why should we be</p>
<p>surprised, then, at what some men do?&quot;<br>4</p>
<p>No law, however strong, will suffice if there is not the inner will</p>
<p>to overcome illegal acts. Each of us, every day, is his own lawmaker ;<br>each of us is constantly making decisions as to right and wrong. If we<br>break our own personal laws of morality and integrity, then legal laws<br>mean nothing to us.</p>
<p>Unless lawyers demand a moral responsibility of each other, and<br>discipline their own brethren, they are but tools of their clients, especially<br>the large corporations. These, by definition, are profit motivated. Recent<br>revelation of corporate violations of law---illegal political contributions,<br>bribery, price fixing —show that, for many, profit as an end justifies<br>illegal means. Corporation lawyers have done much to nullify national<br>legislation and regulation in many areas including defense contracting,<br>and have been instrumental in refining the often questionable methods by<br>which industry advances its interests. Too often corporation lawyers<br>have placed the interests of their corporate masters ahead of their duty<br>to serve society.</p>
<p>It is widely recognized that the rich and the powerful have greater<br>access to your profession and are not subjected to the law to the same<br>extent as those less fortunate. You will remember the old English rhyme:</p>
<p>The law locks up the man or woman</p>
<p>Who steals the goose from off the common;</p>
<p>But leaves the greater villain loose</p>
<p>Who steals the common from the goose,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>I think that every lawyer in this room should be distressed by the</p>
<p>failures of our judicial system. Our courts and jails are overcrowded<br>and criminals go unpunished. Ninety percent of the criminals brought<br>to trial are acquitted. How many of you feel a personal responsibility<br>to put these things right ?</p>
<p>Every lawyer who sees these wrongs and takes no action—either<br>with his brother lawyer, with his bar association, or with his legislature—<br>contributes by his acquiescence to the decline of America, Remember<br>that &quot;silence gives consent.&quot;</p>
<p>You may wonder why I appear to be so ungracious as to accept an<br>award from your group, yet take the occasion to criticize your profession.<br>As a student in history, I have been concerned with the moral climate of<br>our country. I am concerned that some of the values held by our people<br>are in the process of disintegration. Ancient wisdom has taught us that<br>it is necessary for most of us to be periodically reinstructed in moral<br>values. This is why religions require a weekly moral lesson. I have<br>therefore taken this occasion to restate my convictions.</p>
<p>I believe it is the duty of each of us to act as if the fate of the world<br>depended on him. Admittedly, one person cannot do the entire job by<br>himself; but one person can make a difference. One lawyer here tonight<br>might decide to put service to his fellow-men and to this nation ahead of</p>
<p>his career, as did Jefferson and Adams and other great lawyers of the</p>
<p>American Revolution, and thus be instrumental in changing the direction<br>and history of America. Those who are fainthearted should remember<br>the words of a great pioneer of legal change, the late Chief Justice<br>Arthur T. Vanderbilt of New Jersey, who said: &quot;Judicial reform is no<br>sport for the shortwinded or for lawyers who are afraid of temporary<br>defeat.&quot;</p>
<p>Reform is not for the amiable. Those who value an easy acceptance<br>from their peers more than achievement, and friendliness more than<br>accomplishment, will fall short. No one who wants to conquer a tough job<br>is amiable. The most renowned lawgiver-—Moses—was not; he wanted<br>to conquer sin.</p>
<p>Many years ago I read a story about a German regular officer and a<br>German SS officer in Poland in World War II. The SS officer was abusing<br>a Pole. The German regular came to the Pole&#x27;s defense. For this he was<br>sentenced to be shot. He was asked by a friend: &#x27;&#x27;Knowing the consequences<br>to you, why did you intercede?&quot; He replied, &quot;My conscience required it, &quot;&#x27;<br>His friend said, &#x27;&#x27;You knew you couldn&#x27;t have any effect; why did you risk<br>your life?&quot; He replied, &#x27;&#x27;As long as there is even one witness, no word<br>or action is finally lost.&quot;</p>
<p>I seek those who have the spirit and the desire to build respect for<br>the legal profession, so it may take the lead in placing our nation under</p>
<p>the rule of law and not of men. That is your professional and personal</p>
<p>obligation.</p>
