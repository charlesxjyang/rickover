      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s June 1980 address, titled &quot;DELIVERY COPY,&quot; provides a stark assessment of the growing Soviet naval threat and advocates for a robust, high-quality U.S. defense posture. Rickover details the unparalleled Soviet naval expansion under Admiral Gorshkov since 1958, noting their construction of over 1800 new ships and combatant craft, and specifically highlighting their numerical superiority in submarines (nearly three times as many as the U.S., with 5 construction yards to America&#x27;s 2). He argues that since the U.S. cannot match Soviet numbers, it must prioritize the quality and capability of its ships, emphasizing an offensive strategy and the critical need for flexible, nuclear-powered vessels. Rickover points to the cost-effectiveness and operational advantages of Los Angeles-class attack submarines (SSN688) over slower alternatives, underscores the importance of Trident ballistic missile submarines for strategic deterrence and independent basing, and advocates for nuclear-powered AEGIS cruisers to ensure mobility and minimize logistical vulnerability for carrier task forces in high-threat areas. He concludes by stressing the vital importance of retaining experienced, nuclear-trained naval personnel through adequate pay and benefits, and appeals to Congress to uphold its responsibility in maintaining national defense for the nation&#x27;s survival.</p>

        <p>Deliveky cory</p>
<p>O the soviets have more major surface combatants than we, and are introducing new ships at a greater rate, these include 4 new classes of cruisers, one of which will likely be nuclear powered, at about 22,090 tons, it nould be the world's largest nuclear powered cruiser and will carry a formidable array of weapons,</p>
<p>O since 1970, they have introduced 10 new submarine designs; the U.S, tho, during this period, the soviets have put to sea more new design submarines than any other country during a comparable period in all of naval history,</p>
<p>O their program has strong support and virtually unlimited funding, they are striving for qualitative superiority. They already have numerical superiority, our program is uncertain and does not cet strong support from the defense department,</p>
<p>After a series of hearings, the seapower subcommittee of the house armed services committee issued a strong report in december 1979 recommending an increased attack submarine building rate to keep the force level up, and recommending that the navy proceed with building improved SSN6&amp;8 los angeles class submarines,</p>
<p>Yet a mixed attack submarine force of some slower and some faster units continues to be studied by the systems analysts and will likely be studied for years to come. Even though all the studies show that the faster, more capable submarines are more cost effective over their lifetime in postulated &quot;operational scenarios,” the defense department continues to press for building cheaper, less capable submarines to save on initial costs,</p>
<p>O the slower U.S, submarines would be unable to escort U.S, surface ships in high speed operations,</p>
<p>O the slower U.S, submarines would require an extra day and a half to transit the atlantic, in a day</p>
<p>In which to hide. Our existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines are noisy compared to present standards. They were all built with the technology of the 1950's, quieter submarines are necessary to decrease the probability of detection and t9 ensure survivability of our seaborne strategic deterrent,</p>
<p>For the past several years, navy witnesses have testified that the AEGIS system is needed to protect our surface ships against the projected soviet air threat in the 1980's, these ships would be key elements in providing sophisticated air defense for our aircraft carrier strike forces against enemy missiles, present navy plans are to build a number of oil fired, gas turbine powered AEGIS fleet air defense ships, the cg 47 class,</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that tankers can survive in areas where the threat is great enough to require first line naval strike forces. When a non-nuclear AEGIS ship runs low on fuel, it will have to retreat to an area of lower threat to meet a tanker, losing the AEGIS system's protection just &quot;hen it is most needed. Unless nuclear powered AEGIS cruisers are built, our nuclear carriers will have to be accompanied by ccnventionally powered AEGIS ships when they enter the highest threat areas, this would constrain the task group to the logistics limitations of the oil fired, gas turbine powered cruisers, thus sacrificing the significant military advantages of the all-nuclear carrier task force in the very areas where these advantages are most needed,</p>
<p>Life cycle cost comparisons of nuclear and conventional warships compare peacetime costs, and assume that carrier task forces can be safely replenished wherever they may be. If the cost of providing the carrier task forces with the ability to conduct replenishment operations in areas subject to the soviet naval threat of the 1989’s were used, the overall cost of nuclear powered surface warships would be shown to be less than that</p>
<p>I have shared with you my thoughts from my vantage point of being involved in our nation’s defense for a long time and in charge of the nuclear propulsion program since its inception over 25 years ago, from that perspective, I AM particularly sensitive to the role that the congress has played, without repeated congressional actions and help throughout the years, we simply would not, today, have the strong nuclear fleet we have, now representing over 49% of the navy's major combatants, you have the constitutional responsibility to maintain this nation's ability to defend itself, indeed no other national issue is more critical than national defense, if we are not able to prevail against our enemies, all other issues, however significant, become irrelevant, it is to the congress that we all must look for a defense posture strong enough to assure our survival as a nation,</p>
