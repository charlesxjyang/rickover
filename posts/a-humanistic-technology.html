      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document presents Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s remarks and a speech titled &quot;A Humanistic Technology,&quot; delivered on May 7, 1975. Rickover begins with a heartfelt tribute to Congressman George H. Mahon, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, highlighting Mahon&#x27;s dedication to a strong national defense and modern nuclear Navy. The main speech argues for a &quot;humanistic technology,&quot; asserting that technology must serve human interests rather than dictate them, and emphasizes a critical distinction between science (immutable knowledge) and technology (actions based on knowledge, which are debatable and can be harmful). Rickover critiques the historical misuse of technology, citing the near-extinction of whales (referencing R.A. Piddlington&#x27;s *The Limits of Mankind*), widespread pollution, and the tragic consequences of dangerous drugs like thalidomide, while also mentioning Rachel Carson&#x27;s *Silent Spring* in relation to pesticides. He advocates for stronger protective laws based on the principle of &quot;mutuality of liberty&quot; and stresses the need to professionalize engineering, similar to medicine, to ensure that human welfare guides technological development.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Remarks</p>
<p>by Admiral H, G, Rickover, U.S. Navy at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association Midland Country Club Midland, Texas Wednesday, May 7, 1975</p>
<p>Before starting my Speech I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the contributions of a distinguished Texan and one of the great men of our Congress, The Honorable George H, Mahon,</p>
<p>I have known Congressman Mahon for more than a quarter of a century, In all that time he has never wavered from his ceaseless devotion toa strong defense for the United States, He has been and continues to be at the forefront of those in Congress who fight for a modern nuclear powered Navy. He knows that in today's troubled world, if one might err in judgment it is better to err on the side of strength than on the side of weakness,</p>
<p>To know him is to be attracted to him. Not that he has ever made any attempt to curry favor or radiate charm. On occasion he can be sharp, even curt, He is not a man to suffer fools gladly. But no one can be</p>
<p>associated with him for long and not sense an underlying warmth and</p>
<p>kindliness,</p>
<p>The casual observer, considering this man who began his working life so modestly and became what we have known him to be, might say that fortune smiled on him and that he was lucky. But has anything—</p>
<p>any advancement, any distinction, any responsibility—ever come to him that he has not earned by application and industry, by sheer force of mind, character and integrity ?</p>
<p>There is no affectation in him, no false humility. He knows his capacities, and takes pride in them, He looks on them as a trust of which he must be the diligent and faithful steward, The people to whom he responds are those who have ability and put it to full use, who daunted neither by toil nor difficulty, give themselves without reserve to the work they have in hand,</p>
<p>He is a prodigious worker himself. Nothing less than full mastery of any subject he tackles will satisfy him, When circumstances make it impossible to realize that goal, he regards it as a matter for self-reproach. Although a man of intense convictions, he is always open-minded, and he is not beyond persuasion until the last word has been spoken,</p>
<p>He knows what his goals are at all times, and he has the ability, the experience, the determination, the strength of character combined with high resolve and patriotism, to perform his duties in the best interest, as he honestly conceives it, of this nation,</p>
<p>He is patient, laborious, and intelligent at his task. He is shrewd in</p>
<p>judgment and sound in decision, He has the gift of instantly seeing the</p>
<p>main point at issue, no matter how much it is covered up with a mass</p>
<p>of details, and the courage to speak out his mind at once. He has vividness, he has sensitivity, sharpness; he has wit, he has a tremendous sense of the essence of human character,</p>
<p>Ever a gentleman, he is thoughtful of individuals regardless of viewpoint, He is helpful and understanding in all official matters,</p>
<p>affectionate and sympathetic in any private concern,</p>
<p>His standards of high integrity and honor, professional conduct and competence, are of immense importance to the well-being of our country in an age when the values on which the continuance of civilization and organized human society depend are being questioned. He is an idealist and pragmatist, a complex of courage and expediency, intolerant of i pettiness and sham,</p>
<p>Some may find themselves in disagreement with the way he applies his philosophy, but no one ever doubts the sincerity with which it is held, or the integrity with which it is offered, And those who work with him and see his day-to-day conduct, in Congress and outside it, know that he is sensitive, honest, intelligent, aware of and often sympathetic to opposing arguments, generous even to those who oppose him, and capable of admitting a mistake,</p>
<p>Sometimes he is tough. One has to be and ought to be when dealing with such important matters as the defense and welfare of this great nation. But he is always fair.</p>
<p>As the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee he is one</p>
<p>&quot; of the few officials in our Government upon whom the responsibility rests</p>
<p>to recommend to Congress the specific allocation of funds for each and</p>
<p>every phase of work to be supported by the Federal Government, His experience on the Appropriations Committee for over three decades and as Chairman of the full committee for the last eleven years has provided him a unique vantage point from which to view our defense,</p>
<p>The record he has made is memorable and outstanding in its import and impact upon the national welfare. His decisions affect the life of every American,</p>
<p>Now to my speech—A HUMANISTIC TECHNOLOGY.</p>
<p>Fis speech reflects the views for release 17:00 PM (cdt)</p>
<p>A HUMANISTIC TECHNOLOGY by Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy at the Thirteenth Annual Meeting of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association Midland Country Club Midland, Texas Wednesday, May 7, 1975</p>
<p>Change is now part of life in all industrially advanced countries— continuous, rapid, all-pervading change. The ultimate cause of this unsettling situation is the explosion of science: factual knowledge doubles every decade or so, Its direct cause is the technological revolution: new knowledge is put to practical use about as rapidly as knowledge itself expands,</p>
<p>The impact of technology on individuals and on society at large is profoundly affected by the attitude of the public and of its leaders toward technology; that is, by prevailing concepts of what technology is and what purpose it should serve.</p>
<p>When technology is believed to be a force with a momentum of its own that puts it beyond human direction or restraint, it may become a Franken- stein manster destroying its creator. But when it is viewed humanistically, in other words, as a means to human ends, it can be made to produce</p>
<p>maximum benefit and do minimum harm to human beings, and to the values</p>
<p>that make for civilized living.</p>
<p>I propose to show there is a tendency in contemporary thinking to regard technology as an irresistible force rather than a tool. The tendency is more pronounced in some countries than in others but is observable wherever there is rapid technological progress. Since it encourages the use of technology in ways that on balance are harmful, this viewpoint should be replaced by a humanistic attitude—an attitude that looks upon technology as an instrument created for no other purpose than to serve man.</p>
<p>Technology is tools, techniques, procedures, things; the artifacts fashioned by modern industrial man to increase his powers of mind and body. Marvelous they are, but let us not be overawed by these artifacts. Certainly they, themselves, do not dictate how we should use them nor, by their mere existence, do they authorize actions that were not anteriorly lawful. We alone bear responsibility for our technology. In this, as in all our actions, we are bound by the principles governing human behavior in our society. Ethics, I hardly need say, are not only personal but social as well.</p>
<p>This cannot be overemphasized for the notion is widespread that, having wrought vast changes in the material conditions of life, technology perforce renders obsolete traditional concepts of ethics and morals, as</p>
<p>well as accustomed ways of arranging political and social relationships.</p>
<p>Earnest debates are currently taking place as to whether it is possible to act morally in the new technological society, and proposals have been made—-quite seriously——that science must now replace traditional ethics! We have here a confusion of means with ends that should be cleared up.</p>
<p>The laws disclosed by science must, of course, be heeded by those who wish to exploit scientific discoveries; in his technological activities man is bound by the laws of science. But it does not follow that he is bound by the laws of science in his purely human relations as well. &quot;Science, '' wrote Vannevar Bush, &quot;has come a long way, in delineating the probable nature of the universe that surrounds us, of the physical world in which we live, of our own structure, our physical and chemical nature, It even enters into the mechanism by which the brain itself operates. Then it comes to the question of consciousness and free will—and there it stops. No longer can science prove, or even bear evidence. Those who base their personal philosophies or their religion upon science are left, beyond that point, without support. &quot;'</p>
<p>Through technology, man has been relieved of much brutal, exhausting, physical labor as well as boring routine work. Why should the ease and affluence made possible by technology affect precepts that have guided Western man for centuries? This may brand me as old-fashioned but I have not yet found occasion to discard a single principle that was accepted in the America of my youth. Why should anyone feel in need of a new ethical code because he is healthier or because he has acquired better tools for</p>
<p>doing his work ?</p>
<p>ti b ih F :</p>
<p>Tools are for utilizing the external resources at our disposal,</p>
<p>principles are for marshaling our inner, our human resources. With</p>
<p>tools we alter our physical environment; principles serve to order our</p>
<p>personal life and our relations with others. The two have nothing to do with</p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p>It disturbs me to be told that technology &quot;demands&quot; an action the speaker favors, or that &quot;you can't stop progress. '&quot; It troubles me that we are so easily pressured by purveyors of technology into permitting so-called &quot;progress&quot; to alter our lives, without attempting to control it-— as if technology were an irrepressible force of nature to which we must meekly submit. If we reflected, we might discover that not everything hailed as progress contributes to happiness; that the new is not always better nor the old always outdated.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are receptive to these arguments because we tend to confuse technology with science. Not only in popular thinking but even among the well-informed the two are not always clearly distinguished. In consequence, characteristics pertaining to science are attributed to technology.</p>
<p>Science has to do with discovering the true facts and relationships of observable phenomena in nature, and with establishing theories that serve to organize masses of verified data concerning these facts and relationships. Because of the care scientists take to verify the facts</p>
<p>supporting their theories, and their readiness to alter theories when</p>
<p>new facts prove an established theory to be imperfect, science has great authority. What the scientific community accepts as proven is not questioned by the public. No one disputes that the earth attracts the moon, or that atomic fission produces energy.</p>
<p>But technology cannot claim the authority of science. It is properly</p>
<p>a subject of debate, not alone by experts but by the public as well. It</p>
<p>has proved anything but infallibly beneficial. Much harm has been done to man and nature because technologies have been used with no thought</p>
<p>for the possible consequences of their interaction with nature. A certain ruthlessness has been encouraged by the mistaken belief that to disregard human considerations is as necessary in technology as it is in science. The analogy is false.</p>
<p>The methods of science require rigorous exclusion of the human factor. They were developed to serve the needs of scientists, whose sole interest is to comprehend the universe; to know the truth; to know it accurately and with certainty. The searcher for truth cannot pay attention to his own or other people's likes and dislikes, or to popular ideas of the fitness of things. This is why science is the antithesis of &quot;humanism, &quot;' despite the fact that historically modern science developed out of and parallel to the humanism of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Science, being pure thought, harms no one; therefore it need not be humanistic, But technology is action, and often potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>Unless it is made to adapt itself to human interests, needs, values, and principles, more harm will be done than good. Never before, in all his long life on earth, has man possessed such enormous power to injure his human fellows and his society as has been put into his hands by modern technology.</p>
<p>This is why it is important to maintain a humanistic attitude toward technology; to recognize clearly that, since it is a product of human effort, technology can have no legitimate purpose but to serve man—man in general, not merely some men; future generations, not merely those who currently wish to gain advantage for themselves; man in the totality of his humanity, encompassing all his manifold interests and needs, not merely some one particular concern of his. Humanistically viewed, technology is not an end in itself but a means to an end; the end being determined by man himself in accordance with the laws prevailing in his society.</p>
<p>The word law has come to have two disparate meanings: Law, as commonly understood, refers to those rules of human conduct prescribed and enforced by society. Scientists who have appropriated the term use it to describe regularities exhibited by physical phenomena. In the transition, the word has taken on a new meaning.</p>
<p>Law that governs human society is not the result of scientific method, but of wisdom and experience. This law is always debatable and can be changed. What the scientist calls law is really immutable fact. Or, if</p>
<p>you prefer, it is law operating in a sphere where man exercises no influence. He cannot alter the laws of the cosmos; he can only discover them. Scientific law has relevance for man only because it makes the universe more comprehensible to him and, by disclosing how nature works, allows him to utilize the forces of nature for his own purposes, When we make use of these forces, we must, of course, heed the laws of science which describe their behavior; they are laws we cannot bend to our will. But we must likewise heed the man-made laws of our society, for technology is action which affects fellow human beings. Technology, therefore, is Subject to both the law of the cosmos and the</p>
<p>law of man. Much confusion in popular thinking arises from this fact,</p>
<p>The two laws are confounded, Or, to put it differently, they are thought</p>
<p>to be part of a Single system of law so that one or the other must perforce</p>
<p>take precedence.</p>
<p>Ever since science discovered that the earth is not the center of the</p>
<p>watt 5 Saati el ie</p>
<p>eS</p>
<p>cosmos, as had been maintained by the highest human authorities, we have</p>
<p>Sars Ect</p>
<p>been learning painfully that the laws of science cannot be overturned by</p>
<p>human fiat. Today, acceptance of duly authenticated Scientific theories</p>
<p>eae Tan ji —</p>
<p>= = 7 = aH ofa Ti cin ofes</p>
<p>or laws is common practice in enlightened countries.</p>
<p>It has taken a long time to attain this rational attitude toward science, and we are conscious of the consequences of intolerance in the past, Perhaps this is why we have been excessively tolerant toward those who</p>
<p>Claim the right to use technology as they see fit, and who are wont to treat</p>
<p>every attempt by society to regulate such use in the public interest as</p>
<p>if it were a modern repetition of the persecution of Galileo!</p>
<p>Assuredly, we have the right to use the instrumentality of law and of government to protect ourselves against technological injury. Yet this simple truth is obscured by the effective way in which opponents of protective measures play upon the layman's respect for science—in a conscious or unconscious attempt to brainwash the public so it will accept their argument without debate. When attacking legislation that would restrain the user of technology, it is common practice to argue as if at issue were acceptance of a law of science. Yet what is being discussed is not science but the advisability or legality of the technological exploitation of science. The public would not be deceived by such arguments if it clearly understood the fundamental difference between science—which is pure knowledge-—and technology—which is action based on knowledge.</p>
<p>To guard against being misled, one should cultivate an attitude of skepticism whenever the word science is used. Is it science that is being discussed or is it technology? If technology, the question at once arises whether the proposed action is legally permissible and socially desirable. Technology must conform to that most basic of all legal maxims, the &quot;mutuality of liberty&quot;; the principle that one man's liberty of action ends where it would injure another. Without this maxim, freedom would be a</p>
<p>barren privilege.</p>
<p>Humanistically viewed, technology can have no legitimacy unless</p>
<p>it inflicts no harm, Granted this premise, the prerequisite for users</p>
<p>of technology is—or ought to be—that they comprehend and respect the laws of science applicable to their particular technology; that they exercise a prudent man's care in assessing the probable consequences</p>
<p>of this technology; and, should it be potentially harmful, that they abstain from using the technology until they have found ways to render it harmless.</p>
<p>Whether or not a particular technology has harmful potentialities ought not to be decided unilaterally by those who wish to use it. Destructive technologies are often highly profitable for those promoting them. They are an interested party to the conflict between private and public interest that every potentially harmful technology poses. Moreover, they are nearly always practical men more knowledgeable about efficiency in using a technology than about the legal and scientific implications of such use.</p>
<p>A broader range of intellectual power should be brought to bear on the whole question of technological exploitation of scientific knowledge. Purely practical considerations should be supplemented with scholarly knowledge of long-range consequences; private interest in efficiency with public interest in safety. The practical approach to a new scientific discovery and its utilization through technology is usually short-range and private, concerned only with ways to put the discovery to use in the most economical and efficient manner, little thought being given to its</p>
<p>ultimate consequences. The scholarly approach—-if I may use this term—is long-range and public; it looks to the effects which a new technology may have on people in general, on the nation, on the world; on present and future generations. Both approaches are necessary to illuminate the problem and help solve it. To exclude the one or the other prevents finding the way to a humanistic technology.</p>
<p>I can best illustrate what I want to bring out by a simple example. Commercial deep-sea fishing can be done so efficiently with modern techniques that a few enterprises could rapidly sweep the oceans free of commercial fish. And this is what the fishermen of all nationalities wish to do. As practical men, they are interested only in using technology to increase their catch, preserve it, and get it to market as speedily as possible. In pursuing this short-range private objective, they have been quite ingenious. Figuratively speaking, the world's marine scholars have stood by wringing their hands at the fishermen's &quot;practical&quot; folly. To the scholars it has been incomprehensible that rational human beings should fail to see that in the end more can be taken from the sea if fishing conforms to sensible conservation measures which permit the species to reproduce itself.</p>
<p>We witness at the moment the end of one of the saddest cases of misuse of technology by greedy fishing interests. Unless these interests are curbed by truly effective international action, the great whales—the blue, the finback, the sperm-—will soon disappear, victims of man's</p>
<p>&quot;practical&quot; folly. 10</p>
<p>These and other whales once populated the high seas in immense numbers. For hundreds of years whaling remained a reasonably fair contest between man and the intelligent, swift-moving mammals he hunted. Modern technology has turned it into brutal genocide. Blindly pursuing what they doubtless consider an eminently practical objective maximum profit today—the whalers are wiping out the very resources that could insure them a profit tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hunting of the blue whale has now been prohibited, but not so for the finback whale. Ten of the whaling nations are now willing to ban the catching and killing of all whales—Japan and Russia will not agree, Thus, despite long efforts to regulate whaling, the problem still exists.</p>
<p>Practical considerations aside, is anyone justified in using technology to exterminate a species that has existed on this earth for eons-—the largest animal the world has ever seen? Are we certain our descendants may not at some future time have need of these mammals? R. A. Piddlington, in his book The Limits of Mankind, remarks that nobody knows what the biological consequences are likely to be of the whales' extermination. &quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;if nearly a million of these huge animals, with their enormous appetites, can be removed in a Single generation from the balance of marine life without Causing violent repercussions, all our previous experience of this subject has given us</p>
<p>the wrong answers,&quot;</p>
<p>Irretrievable damage has been done by those who use technology</p>
<p>without giving thought to its effect on our environment. Waste products, carelessly emitted, create a massive problem of soil, water, and air pollution—we may be damaging the atmosphere permanently by changing its chemical composition. Wholesale slaughter of wild animals upsets the ecology with consequences we cannot even fathom as yet.</p>
<p>Insofar as damage is still remediable—and much of it can never be undone—it must be remedied by public action, at taxpayer's expense. The total cost to the public of private carelessness and willfulness in the use of technology will be enormous.</p>
<p>Experience shows that by itself, the legal maxim of &quot;the mutuality of liberty&quot; will not prevent premature commitment to technologies that may later prove harmful. The maxim must be implemented by preventive public action—action of the kind that has long been operative in the field of public health. There is need for laws requiring that before a particular technology may be used, reliable tests must have been made to prove it will be useful and safe. A few such laws are already on the statute books; more are needed. But we rarely get positive action until a human tragedy dramatizes the need for protection.</p>
<p>In the United States we now have preventive laws protecting the public against dangerous drugs. The first law, strongly opposed by the</p>
<p>pharmaceutical interests, did not pass until a major tragedy had occurred—</p>
<p>the death of a considerable number of patients who had taken a drug</p>
<p>which was effective in the treatment of their particular disease, but had unfenessen aide effects proving fatal to some. After much procrastination, a second, more stringent law was passed, but not until the uproar over the thalidomide babies caused the legislators to respond with alacrity.</p>
<p>Though a technology may clearly harm paramount human values, restraining laws are generally not enacted unless public demand is sufficiently vocal and persistent to wear down the opposition of those with a vested interest in the harmful technology. Opposition tactics follow a pattern that is monotonously repeated whenever the attempt is made to regulate a technology in the public interest. It is well to familiarize oneself with the pattern.</p>
<p>I have mentioned efforts to confuse the issue by arguing as if a law of science were at issue when, in fact, the proposed legislation deals with technology, not science. If this argument fails, the need for the proposed law is then categorically denied. Warnings of scientists are rejected as &quot;unproven&quot; and &quot;exaggerated.&quot;' Later, when these prove to have been entirely correct, the argument shifts from the substantive question of whether a technology is harmful to an attack on the legitimacy of any kind of protective legislation. Such legislation would violate basic liberties, it is claimed; it would</p>
<p>establish government tyranny and subvert free democratic institutions. If all this proves futile and legislation is imminent, there will be urgent demands it be postponed until ''more research&quot; can be undertaken to establish the appositeness of the proposed law.</p>
<p>These delaying tactics are highly effective. It takes firm commitment to a humanistic technology to push through needed legislation as well as thorough understanding of the filibustering tactics of opponents, and great skill in combating these tactics. No wonder public opinion and the law have nowhere fully caught up with those who misuse technology. Often as not they escape with impunity, no matter how gravely they injure man or society.</p>
<p>Let me give you one more example of the harm done by technological interference. Today we have new technologies for the destruction of insect pests and weeds. Their use is profitable for the manufacturers of pesticides and weed killers; it is helpful to farmers who are able to get better crops, reduce human labor, and produce at greater profit; it benefits consumers who are offered a wider variety of food at less cost. Here is a classic case to what technology can do for us. Unfortunately, we have left out of consideration the balance of nature. If used improperly, these pesticides and weed killers poison soil, crops, birds, animals, fish, and eventually man. In her book Silent Spring, Rachel Carson spoke out eloquently | against committing this ecological sin.</p>
<p>Ecologists constantly warn us that when the balance of nature is</p>
<p>upset, everything in nature is threatened, including man himself. It seems certain that, unless he sets limits to his destructive instinct, man will ultimately exterminate all wild life. He will then be left alone on</p>
<p>earth with his domesticated animals and with swarms of insects and</p>
<p>germs; alone in a world he has fashioned in the image of his technology. The examples I have given show that to make technology safe, we must have protective laws; that enactment of such laws depends upon a humanistic attitude toward technology on the part of significant segments of the public and its leaders. But more is needed. Law and public opinion nearly always lag behind the swift development of new technologies. Therefore, what is additionally needed is more informed and responsible thinking among those who manage technologies. This can best be brought about by professionalizing the decision-making process in technology. Experience has shown that, in the hands of professional persons, technology is managed with greater concern for human welfare than when it is controlled, as at present, by nonprofessionals. The classic example is medicine. Of all technologies, that of the physician has benefited man most and harmed him least. The stringent standards set by the profession and by society for the education and professional conduct of physicians accounts for this happy circumstance. Not only is no one permitted to practice who has not given proof of his competence, but physicians must also be broadly, liberally, humanistically educated men and women.</p>
<p>This gives them perspective in evaluating their professional actions, an</p>
<p>ability to see these actions against a humanistic background. Moreover, they operate under a code of ethics which requires them to place the needs of patients above all other considerations.</p>
<p>We owe to Greece the noble idea that special knowledge and skill ought to be used humanistically, instead of merely for personal aggrandizement or power, or as a means of extracting maximum gain from those in need of the services of men possessing special expertise. Yet this precept is rarely followed outside medicine and a few other &quot;learned&quot; or liberal professions. Most human affairs are conducted on the old Roman maxim of caveat emptor.</p>
<p>I have long believed that we should come appreciably closer to a humanistic technology if engineering were practiced as a humanistic profession and if, in consequence, engineers were accorded the professional independence granted members of liberal professions. I feel certain engineers would then find it possible to act with the same sense of professional responsibility and service to humanity that is characteristic of good physicians,</p>
<p>The role of the professional man is to lend his special knowledge, his well-trained intellect, his dispassionate habit of visualizing problems in terms of fundamental principles to whatever specific task is entrusted to him. Professional independence is not a special privilege but rather</p>
<p>an inner necessity for the true professional man; it is a Safeguard</p>
<p>for his employer and for the public as well, It is what Chiefly sets him apart from the skilled technician.</p>
<p>This independence of professional judgment has not yet been accorded the engineer, He still has to win it for himself, Even within the same organization, it may happen that the most experienced engineer's professional judgment will be Overruled by a lay superior, while no one would think of dictating to a physician, no matter how young and inexperienced he might be. Yet the university-trained engineer is as competent a professional in his field as is the physician. The difference lies in the determination of the medical profession to resist lay interference and its success in winning this point, while the engineering profession has Shown little determination and therefore has had little success,</p>
<p>I speak of this with feeling, As you know, my work is in one of the new technologies; one that is dangerous unless properly handled. Iam frequently faced with the difficulty of convincing administrative superiors that it is not safe for them to overrule their technical experts. Here is a case in point:</p>
<p>A superior once asked me to reduce radiation Shielding in our nuclear submarines. He said the advantage of getting a lighter-weight reactor plant was worth risking the health of personnel, It was not</p>
<p>possible to make him see that such a concept could not be accepted;</p>
<p>that, moreover, where radiation is involved, we are dealing not just with the lives of present day individuals but with the genetic future of all mankind. His attitude was that we did not know much about evolution and, if we raised radiation exposures, we might find the resulting mutations to be beneficial—-that mankind might &quot;learn to live with radiation. '' As you may surmise, I did not reduce the thickness of the shielding.</p>
<p>How we use technology affects profoundly the shape of our society. In the brief span of time—a century or so—that we have had a science- based technology, what use have we made of it? We have multiplied inordinately, wasted irreplaceable fuels and minerals and perpetrated incalculable and irreversible ecological harm. I have thought much about this, and I can find no evidence that man contributes anything to the balance of nature-—anything at all. On the strength of his knowledge of nature, he sets himself above nature; he presumes to change the natural environment for all the living creatures on this earth. Do we, who are transients and not overly wise, really believe we have the right to upset the order of nature, an order established by a power higher than man ?</p>
<p>These are complicated matters for ordinary citizens to evaluate and decide. How, in future, to make wiser use of technology is perhaps</p>
<p>the paramount public issue facing electorates in all industrial democracies;</p>
<p>a problem difficult enough in itself but rendered still more so by the strategies of those who wish to continue using harmful technologies.</p>
<p>It cannot be said too often that government has as much a duty to protect the land, the air, the water, the natural environment of man against such damage, as it has to protect the country against foreign enemies and the individual against criminals; conversely, that every citizen is duty bound to make an effort to understand how technology operates and what are its possibilities and limitations. All this is necessary if technology is to be assigned its proper place in human affairs, if it is to be made humanistic.</p>
<p>A free society centers on man. It gives paramount consideration to human rights, interests, and needs. But once ordinary citizens come to feel that public issues are beyond their comprehension, a pattern of life may develop where technology, not man, would become central to the purpose of society. If we permit this to happen, the human liberties for which mankind has fought, at so great a cost of</p>
<p>effort and sacrifice, will be extinguished.</p>
