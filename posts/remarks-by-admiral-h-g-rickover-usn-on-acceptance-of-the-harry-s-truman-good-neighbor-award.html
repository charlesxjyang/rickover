      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his acceptance speech for the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award on May 8, 1979, Admiral H. G. Rickover expresses profound admiration for President Truman, highlighting his pivotal role in the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion, particularly the USS Nautilus. Rickover recounts Truman&#x27;s farsightedness in supporting the project, noting that Truman himself laid the keel for the Nautilus on June 14, 1952, viewing it as a step towards peaceful atomic energy uses. He also reveals a conversation where Truman justified the use of atomic bombs on Japan by estimating 250,000 American casualties in the planned invasion of Okinawa (Operation Olympic), a fact that resonated deeply with Rickover, who was stationed there. Beyond these historical decisions, Rickover praises Truman&#x27;s personal qualities—courage, integrity, modesty, and an &quot;austere sense of duty,&quot; aligning him with the philosopher Ortega y Gasset&#x27;s description of individuals who make great demands upon themselves, setting and achieving goals for the nation.</p>

        <p>Remarks By ApmrrAL H. G. Rickover, USN On AccepTANCE OF THE HARRY S. TRUMAN GoopD NEIGHBOR AWARD May 8, 1979</p>
<p>I AM greatly honored to be here this afternoon to receive the harry S. Truman goop neighbor award. I had the privilege of meeting and talking with president truman on several occasions. I admired him greatly for his achieve- ments and because he was a singularly warmhearted human being. 10 be the recipient of this award established in his name moves me deeply.</p>
<p>During the early years of study and work toward applying atomic energy to naval ship propulsion, it was this man’s farsightedness and strong encouragement that helped to carry the technology through to reality with the construction of the first nuclear-powered submarine, the nautitus. On june 14, 1952, president truman laid the keel of the NAUTILUS during a ceremony at electric boat in groton, connecticut. In his remarks, he recalled the role atomic energy had played in his administration: the first nuclear detonation at alamogordo and the bombs used</p>
<p>Knowledge of the power of the atom. The NAUTILUS was a military project, but the president saw the ship as a step toward peaceful uses of atomic energy. For her use, new metals had been made and new machinery designed; some day these could be used to produce electric power,</p>
<p>As he concluded his remarks about the NAUTILUS, the president raised his hand. At this signal a crane picked up a large bright yellow keel plate and laid it before the stands, he chalked his initials on the surface, and then a welder burned the letters into the plate. This marked the beginning of construction of the NAUTILUS; the first | step in the building of a new navy--the nuclearr navy we | have today,</p>
<p>But the vision of such a navy actually began at the close of worrld war II with the development of the atomic bomb, once in a conversation with president truman, | asked why he made the decision to use the atomic bomb against japan. He replied that this was based on the fact that there would have been about 250,000 american casualties in the planned invasion of japan from okinawa. Also, an additional year would have been required to defeat japan. This hit close to home because, near the close of world | war II, I had been stationed on okinawa in charge of</p>
<p>President truman was a man of courage, integrity, sim~ plicity, and responsibility» few men in our history have been as free of pretension or self- importance: his innate modesty religious upbringing, and austere sense of duty set him apart from most men who rise to the top in politics. The spanish philosopher ortega y gasset once wrote a book around the thesis that &quot;the most radical division it 1S possible to make of humanity is that which splits it into two classes of creatures: those who make great demands on themselves, piling up diffi- culties and duties; and those who demand nothing special of themselves, but for whom to live is to be every moment what</p>
<p>This impressed me deeply when ] read it as a young man. Since then I have judged people and institutions by whether or not they set themselves a standards whether they measure them~ selves against a criterion that requires effort because they deem it worthy of effort» president truman was such a man; he did not stand still: he set goals for our country and saw to it that they were achieved:</p>
