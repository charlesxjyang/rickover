        <p>Introduction of<br>The Honorable Chet Holifield<br>U.S. House of Representatives<br>Vice Admiral 4 Rickover, USN<br>on the occasion of<br>the Commissioning of USS NARWHAL (SSN671)<br>U.S. eritamptnn Base<br>New London, Connecticut<br>July 12, 1969</p>
<p>Captain Matson, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Tt is a pleasure to introduce a great American, the Honorable Chet<br>Holifield, Congressman from the 19th District of California and Chairman of<br>the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. I recall a cold and windy<br>day three and one half years ago, January 17, 1966, when I introduced Chairman<br>Holifield as he prepared to lay the keel of the NARWHAL. We are fortunate to<br>have him with us again today for her commissioning.</p>
<p>During the intervening years the struggle to maintain a strong nuclear<br>Navy has continued. As in the past, Mr. Holifield has been in the vanguard of<br>those farsighted members of Congress dedicated to preserving our hard-won<br>preeminence in this vital field. Without him, and others of his courage and<br>wisdom, our Nation would be far less secure than it is today.</p>
<p>As we move into the future it should give all of us confidence to know<br>that we can continue to rely on Chairman Holifield&#x27;s leadership and dedication.<br>This is true not only in the field of naval nuclear propulsion. It is also<br>true in all of his far-reaching responsibilities as Chairman of the Joint</p>
<p>Committee on Atomic Energy.</p>
<p>Before giving the rostrum to Chairman Holifield, I am honored to recognize<br>another distinguished American who has contributed immeasurably to our nuclear<br>Navy~-the Honorable Craig Hosmer, Congressman from California&#x27;s 32nd District.<br>He is the senior Republican Congressman on the Joint Committee on Atomic<br>Energy. Had the Republicans won control of the House last November Mr. Hosmer<br>would now be Chairman of the Committee and I know that he and Mr. Holifield<br>would continue to work together 48 they have in the past. And I am pleased<br>that his gracious and lovely lady could be here today.</p>
<p>I can assure you that members of the Joint Committee do not permit politics<br>to influence their decisions in matters affecting national security.</p>
<p>It has been an inspiration and a privilege for me to serve in a common<br>effort with these jllustrious citizens and statesmen who do 80 much honor to</p>
<p>their country and to their state.</p>
