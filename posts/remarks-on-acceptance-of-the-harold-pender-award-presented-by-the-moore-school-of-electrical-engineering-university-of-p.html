      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this October 22, 1976 speech accepting the Harold Pender Award from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover expresses gratitude and pays tribute to Harold Pender&#x27;s significant contributions to engineering, referencing his personal use of Pender&#x27;s *Handbook for Electrical Engineers* during his master&#x27;s studies at Columbia in 1928 and his work in the Bureau of Ships during WWII. Rickover then delves into the evolving role of engineering, from a skilled craft to a profession with social responsibility, emphasizing the need for &quot;tough-minded and competent&quot; engineers due to dwindling natural resources. A central theme is a sharp critique of the American educational system, contrasting its perceived shortcomings with European standards and historical examples from ancient Greece, concluding with a reference to the Book of Job: &quot;Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.&quot;</p>

        <p>Remarks on Acceptance of the Harold Pender Award Presented by The Moore School of Electrical Engineering University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 22 October 1976 I want to thank you for your kind remarks and to say that it is a privilege to be here tonight. The University of Pennsylvania is well known for its excellent educational standards and achievements, Iam sure you are extremely proud, as is the nation, to have a Nobel Prize ‘ winner, Professor Baruch S. Blumberg of the School of Medicine, who ! adds further renown to this distinguished university, ~~ Iam honored to be the recipient of this award named after Harold Pender. His teaching and research contributed significantly to the engineering profession and to advances in industry. Many here tonight are among the hundreds of thousands of engineers who have benefited from the study of his books; in particular, his Handbook for Electrical Engineers. In 1928 I used it in my studies toward a master's degree in electrical engineering at Columbia University. During World War IL, my staff and I used later editions of this Handbook when I was Head of the Electrical Section of the Bureau of Ships, and responsible for the design and procurement of the electrical equipment needed by our Navy and those | of our Allies. Whatever credit I may deserve for receiving this award, I owe to</p>
<p>teachers like Harold Pender who taught and inspired me, and opened to me</p>
<p>the world of books and of knowledge.</p>
<p>I would like to say a few words on the significance of the engineering profession and our educational system.</p>
<p>Engineering has been a skilled craft since remote antiquity. I necessarily remained a craft as long as no other sources of power except human and animal muscle, wind, and water were known. It developed from a craft into a profession when a body of systematic knowledge was acquired— when scientific advances opened up vast new and complex sources of energy in nature for the use and convenience of man, The industrial revolution that began in England about 1760 was based on the substitution of nature's energies for man's; it was essentially a revolution in engineering.</p>
<p>As late as the 19th century, engineers were also organizers, operators, and owners of enterprises. Many of their discoveries and inventions were by-products of their efforts to solve operating problems. And frequently the standards of conduct of these businessmen were colored by those of the market place. Their inventions were made to meet demands; their concern was with the technical efficiency of mechanisms rather than with their social consequences. It was the age of the entrepreneur and laissez-faire.</p>
<p>Today engineering has a greater meaning. The engineer has a social responsibility, for only through engineering can society solve many of its problems—pollution, depletion of natural resources and the energy crisis, to name a few. We now have little time to solve these problems. When our nation began, it was wealthy in resources. Our Bicentennial marks a -2-</p>
<p>profound transformation that has taken place within the lifetimes of most of us. We have ceased being one of the world's richest countries in mineral and fuel resources and a major exporter of raw materials. We are now importing many vitally needed materials. Because the engineer deals with metals and fuels, of which the earth has but a limited supply, it will make a great difference to future generations how well he does his job. Every ounce of metal used, every bit of fuel burned means a diminution of nature's capital stock we bequeath to our descendants.</p>
<p>More than ever before, engineering is for the tough-minded and competent; for those individuals—-and they are few in number —who will accept hard work, self-discipline, and responsibility. ‘ Advancing technology requires trained intelligence, steady commitment, and the sharp edge of self-criticism. The only warranty a good engineer can give is the promise of conscientious work, Excellence is the engineer's stock in trade.</p>
<p>Excellence is rare in any field. It is education which offers—or should offer—the chance for the exceptional individual to flourish and bring to fruition his talents that may enrich society. :</p>
<p>For many years I have been concerned about our educational system, Despite the enormous amounts of money spent on education, the United States has more people who do not possess minimum knowledge of the elements of language, mathematics, history, and geography than most other advanced</p>
<p>nations. The slow pace and the &quot;stretch-out&quot; of American secondary</p>
<p>iF qa</p>
<p>education harms all children. It takes an average child 12 years to reach achievement levels their counterparts in Europe reach in little over eight years. While our children are graduating with a diploma signifying that they have achieved a general education, students in other countries are completing apprenticeships in specialized trades or attending institutions of higher learning.</p>
<p>We are the only advanced nation without a national scholastic standard— the only such nation with a school system that does not challenge its children to meet a national achievement level in order to receive academic rewards.</p>
<p>At present, some of our primary and secondary school teachers are recruited from students who have just barely made it in college—who are just above those who fail. We must insist upon qualified teachers who will not compromise technical or professional judgment in order to placate administrative superiors or gain popularity with their students. Teachers cannot fight against their growing burden of educational administration without the help of parents—-who themselves are aware that they leave no greater legacy than their children.</p>
<p>It is not worthy of a democracy to cheat its children. The youth of ancient Greece once gathered in the agora to learn from wise men about morality and the duties of citizenship. When these men were replaced by</p>
<p>facile teachers eager to demonstrate the easiness of arguing on any side</p>
<p>of a question, the strength of ancient Greece declined, and the age of</p>
<p>Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle was replaced by that of Alexander. The legacy is marked in our language by the meaning of the words “gophist&quot; and &quot;sophistry.&quot;</p>
<p>From a different civilization, also rich in individuals, we draw another lesson far truer than the philosophy of modern education. From</p>
<p>the Book of Job, we learn that: &quot;Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks</p>
<p>fly upward.&quot;</p>
