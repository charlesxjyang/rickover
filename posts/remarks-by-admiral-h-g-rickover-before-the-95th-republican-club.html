      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1980 address, Admiral H.G. Rickover issues a sobering warning about the escalating Soviet naval threat, highlighting their massive shipbuilding program of over 1800 new ships and combatant craft since 1958, including building more than nine times the number of major combatants as the U.S. in the preceding decade. Rickover argues that since the U.S. cannot match Soviet numerical superiority (who possess almost three times as many submarines and five construction yards to the U.S.&#x27;s two), it must prioritize qualitative superiority, primarily through nuclear propulsion. He advocates for continued investment in faster, more capable nuclear attack submarines (like the SSN688 class), emphasizing their operational necessity over cheaper, less capable alternatives. He also champions the Trident ballistic missile submarine program for its increased survivability and ability to eliminate reliance on foreign bases, and calls for nuclear-powered AEGIS cruisers to provide crucial air defense with superior mobility and reduced logistical dependence in high-threat areas. Finally, Rickover underscores the critical challenge of retaining experienced, nuclear-trained naval personnel and the indispensable role of strong Congressional support in ensuring national defense and survival.</p>

        <p>] appreciate the opportunity to meet with you-</p>
<p>I will not dwell on the specifics of the naval nuclear propulsion program | AM responsible for because | have testified on that subject before several congressional committees- [ want to talk on the importance</p>
<p>Of the soviet naval threat as compared to our naval strength+</p>
<p>Soviet agression in afghanistan has brought renewed realization of soviet intentions for world power and concern for the adequacy of our own defense+ what many may not realize is that the soviet threat in naval power, as in other areas, has been growing more ominous- past warnings by many in the military have been greeted with some indifference- however, today we are faced with a naval threat more serious than any</p>
<p>Since world war [I].</p>
<p>Since 1958, the soviets have built over 1800 new ships and combatant craft, a program of naval expansion that surpasses the efforts of any other naval power- from a defensive fleet in world war II, it has evolved into a major bluewater navy that challenges the U-S. For control</p>
<p>As many»</p>
<p>0 the soviets have more major surface combatants than we, and are introducing new ships at a greater rate- these include 4 new classes of cruisers, one of which will likely be nuclear powered: at about 22,000 tons, it would be the world's largest nuclear powered cruiser and will carry a formidable array of</p>
<p>Weapons +</p>
<p>The U-S- two- during this period, the soviets have put to sea</p>
<p>0 their program has strong support and virtually unlimited fundings they are striving for qualitative superiority= they already have numerical superiority our program is uncertain and does not get strong support from the defense</p>
<p>If we miscalculate or succumb to the easy economic choice of putting off decisions, and do not build ships adequate to face the threat, our choice will be to either give in to our enemies or resort to nuclear war+ the cost of adequate strength to ensure peace is small</p>
<p>Yet a mixed attack submarine force of some slower and some faster units continues to be studied by the systems analysts- even though all the studies show that the faster, more capable submarines are more cost effective over their lifetime in postulated &quot;operations scenarios,” the defense department continues to press for building cheaper, less</p>
<p>The arguments for reducing cost by building new, less capable attack submarines are specious- with our limited submarine force level, the normal process of aging will give US a mixed force, with some submarines becoming less capable as they get older- all of the submarine designers and operators support the more capable attack submarine- recent operations have provided actual evidence of the superior capability of the faster los angeles class submarines. Even commanders in the fleet who are not</p>
<p>Ie) the slower U-S- submarines would be unable 10 stay with and</p>
<p>That is what it would take to get the best ones- \</p>
<p>This matter will ultimately have to be settled by congress- the congress has already taken positive action in the FY8] defense authorization bill by authorizing two SSN688 class attack submarines and long lead</p>
<p>It also deleted all long lead funds for a slower, less capable attack submarine, and included advance funds for an improved SSN688 class submarine design- continued strong support by congress will be needed</p>
<p>2+ ijrident</p>
<p>Turning now to the ballistic missile submarines, the FY8]1 shipbuilding program includes a ninth TRIDENT submarine- these submarines will have increased survivability compared to our existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines because they are being built with all the latest technology- they will be more difficult to detect than existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines because they will be quieter, and their longer range missiles will give them 10 to 20 times more ocean area in which to hide- our existing POLARIS and POSEIDON submarines are noisy compared to present standards- they were all built with the technology of the 1950's. Quieter submarines are necessary to decrease the probability of detection</p>
<p>The longer range of the TRIDENT missiles will permit basing our ballistic missile submarines in the U-S- -~ no foreign basing will be required- this will eliminate the vulnerability of our ballistic missile submarine force to international political action that could deny US use</p>
<p>3. Need for nuclear powered AEGIS cruisers</p>
<p>For the past several years, navy witnesses have testified that the AEGIS system is needed to protect our surface ships against the projected soviet air threat in the 1980's. These ships would be key elements in providing sophisticated air defense for our aircraft carrier strike forces against enemy missiles- present navy plans are to build a</p>
<p>I consider that AEGIS ships should be nuclear powered for the same reasons that aircraft carriers need to be nuclear powered -- reasons that have been dramatically demonstrated recently in the indian ocean- the AEGIS is planned as our most capable anti-air warfare weapons system- because they will be expensive, regardless of their means of propulsion, there will never be a large number- in a naval war against an enemy employing sophisticated weapon systems, AEGIS ships will be needed in the areas of highest threat- under such circumstances, the advantages of nuclear propulsion are needed for maximum mobility and minimum logistic support+ the nuclear powered carriers will be employed in high threat</p>
<p>Of lower threat to meet a tanker, losing the AEGIS system’s protection just when it is most needed- unless nuclear powered AEGIS cruisers are built, our nuclear carriers will have to be accompanied by conventionally powered AEGIS ships when they enter the highest threat areas- this would constrain the task group to the logistics limitations of the oil fired, gas turbine powered cruisers, thus sacrificing the significant military advantages of the all-nuclear carrier task force in the very areas where</p>
<p>Life cycle cost comparisons of nuclear and conventional warships compare peacetime costs, and assume that carrier task forces can be safely replenished wherever they may be- if the cost of providing the carrier task forces with the ability to conduct replenishment operations in areas subject to the soviet naval threat of the 1980'S were used, the overall cost of nuclear powered surface warships would be shown to be</p>
<p>In the 1980's and beyond, in any areas where the soviets challenge US, we will need all-nuclear carrier task forces to be able to keep our sea lanes of communication open- aircraft carriers and AEGIS fleet air defense ships will be the principal elements of these naval strike forces which must be capable of fighting in areas of highest threat- considering the difficulties of providing logistic support in such areas, our aircraft carriers and AEGIS warships should be given the</p>
<p>I have provided my thoughts from a vantage point of being involved in our nation's defense for a long time and in charge of the nuclear propulsion program since its inception over years ago- from that perspective, I AM particularly sensitive to the role that the congress has played- without repeated congressional actions and help throughout the years, we simply would not, today, have the strong nuclear fleet we</p>
<p>Have, now representing over 40% of the navy’s major combatants- you</p>
<p>Have the constitutional responsiblity to maintain this nation's ability to defend itself- indeed no other national issue is more critical than national defense- if we are not able to prevail against our enemies,</p>
