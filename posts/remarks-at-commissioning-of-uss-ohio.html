      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address at the commissioning of the USS Ohio, Admiral H. G. Rickover highlights the vessel as the 137th U.S. nuclear-powered ship over 26 years, emphasizing its role in national defense. He candidly states the purpose of such a warship is &quot;to strike fear and terror in the hearts of the enemy,&quot; viewing the Ohio and its sister ships as tangible evidence of America&#x27;s readiness to defend its freedom, thereby lessening the chance of war. Rickover intertwines this military purpose with broader themes of American democracy, acknowledging the nation&#x27;s ongoing &quot;experiment&quot; into its third century and reflecting on the sacrifices made for independence, especially pertinent on Veteran&#x27;s Day. He concludes by stressing the heavy burdens of a strong defense, asserting that &quot;those who wish the blessings of liberty must accept the fatigue of supporting it.&quot;</p>
