      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his remarks from June 20, 1981, Admiral Rickover reflects on the successful first sea trials of the 19,000-ton USS Ohio, contrasting its advanced capabilities with the arduous conditions of early submarines, such as 500-ton and 800-ton &quot;O-boats&quot; and &quot;S-boats.&quot; He highlights the primitive nature of early sub life, detailing challenges like precise ballast trimming (e.g., 300 lbs of water for two men, or 7 tons for salinity changes across the Panama Canal), lack of air-conditioning leading to rashes and bed-bugs on 9-day patrols, and the absence of fresh water. Rickover emphasizes the luxury enjoyed by modern submariners with fresh food, ample water, and showers, passing the torch to the Ohio&#x27;s &quot;plank-owners.&quot; He concludes by likening the occasion to St. Crispian&#x27;s Day, referencing Shakespeare&#x27;s *Henry IV*, and commending the crew for a job well done on a vessel destined to be a powerful deterrent.</p>

<p>DATE - tfai/el</p>
<p>REMARKS BY ADMIRAL RICKOVER ON COMPLETION OF USS OHIO FIRST SEA TRIALS</p>
<p>THE FIRST SEA TRIALS (RO THE OHIO HAVE NOW BEEN COMPLETED.<br>THE OFFICERS AND MEN OPERATED THIS NEW TYPE SUBMARINE IN AN<br>EXEMPLARY MANNER - LIKE VETERANS. I SAY THIS FROM EXPERIENCE<br>IN SUBMARINES GOING BACK MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY - FROM O-BOATS,<br>S-BOATS TO THIS ONE OF 19,000 Tons. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN, IN A 500<br>TON SUBMERGED BOAT (WE CALLED THEM “BOATS” AT THE TIME) - IF TWO<br>MEN WENT FROM THE BOW TO THE STERN THIS WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. As<br>DIVING OFFICER I WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT 300 LBS. OF WATER FROM THE<br>AFTER TO THE FORWARD TANK - WE THEN FIGURED 150 POUNDS PER MAN.</p>
<p>ALSo, WE THEN HAD WHAT WAS CALLED THE &quot;PERISCOPE TRIM”. THE<br>BALANCE WAS SO FINE THAT WHEN WE RAISED OR LOWERED THE PERISCOPE,<br>WE HAD TO TAKE IN OR PUMP OUT A FEW POUNDS OF WATER. I ALSO<br>REMEMBER THE TIME 1 WAS ASSIGNED TO AN 800 TON S-BOAT - AT Coco SoLo.<br>We OFTEN SHIFTED OUR OPERATIONS FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC.<br>AFTER TRANSITING THE PANAMA CANAL, WE HAD TO TAKE IN SEVEN TONS</p>
<p>OF WATER ON REACHING THE PACIFIC SIDE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE</p>
<p>“IN SALINITY OF THE SEA WATER IN THE TWO OCEANS.</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>THERE WAS NO AIR-CONDITIONING THEN. WHEN WE WENT ON A 9-DAY PATROL , \<br>iy WE WERE CONSTANTLY HOT - WE DEVELOPED RASHES. WHEN WE TURNED IN<br>AND TRIED TO SLEEP, WE WERE SC TIRED THAT WE DIDN’T BOTHER FIGHTING<br>(OFF THE BED-BUGSp AND IN THE UPPER BUNK, THE DRIPPING OF WATER THAT HAD<br>CONDENSED ON THE OVER-HEAD INTERFERED WITH SLEEP-AND DREAMS. WHEN WE<br>OCCASIONALLY SURFACED AFTER SUNSET, WE BROUGHT A BUCKET OF FRESH WATER<br>TOP-SIDE AND TOOK A FRESH WATER BATH, SOMETIMES WE JUMPED INTO THE SEA</p>
<p>TO COOL OFF, BUT THE SALT WATER CAUSED THE SKIN TO BE STICKY.</p>
<p>ARE: FRESH, NOT CANNED FOOD, ALL THE FRESH WATER YOU WANT, A SHOWER</p>
<p>THAT CAN BE RUN FPOR=THE-ESEERESEEME, NOT JUST ENOUGH TO WET YOUR ‘BODY;<br>THEN TURNED OFF UNTIL YOU RINSE THE SOAP OFF YOUR BODY. |</p>
<p>I COULD TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS OF SUBMARINES, BUT<br>I WILL NoT. WHEN YOU GET TO MY TIME OF LIFE I CAN ENVISION ALL OF<br>YOU SITTING AT YOUR FIRESIDE TELLING YOUR GRAND-CHILDREN ABOUT THAT<br>ANCIENT SHIP, THE OHIO, OF WHICH YOU WERE A &quot;PLANK-OWNER”. SO I WILL<br>STOP AND LET YOU YOUNGSTERS CARRY THE TORCH.</p>
<p>I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK. I HOPE YOU WILL MAKE FULL USE OF<br>THE OPPORTUNITY THE NAVY HAS GIVEN YOU TO LEAD A WORTH-WHILE,<br>THEREFORE A HAPPY LIFE. AND JUST IMAGINE - THE NAVY IS EVEN PAYING<br>YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF ENGAGING IN THIS INTERESTING WORK! I AM</p>
<p>“SO, YOU YOUNG NOBLEMEN IN THE UHIOyDO NOT KNOW HOW FORTUNATE YOU ~~</p>
<p>THAT HAS JUST BEEN. YOUR PRIVILEGE,</p>
<p>You WILL WELL REMEMBER</p>
<p>THIS DAY - THE pay THE FIRST<br>TRIDENT SUBMARINE - ONE OF</p>
<p>OUR MOST P</p>
<p>OWERFUL DETERRENTS To WAR ~<br>RETURNED FROM SUCCESSFUL SEA TRIALS,</p>
<p>IT sHoutp REMIND YOU oF Sr, CRISPIAN’S DAY,</p>
<p>ALSO AN EVENTFUL DAY,<br>As SHAKESPEARE SAID THEN IN Henry IV:</p>
<p>“THIS DAY IS CALLED THE FEAST oF CRISPIAN:</p>
<p>HE THAT OUTLIVES THIS DAY, AND COMES SAFE HOME,<br>WILL STAND A-TIPTOE WHEN THIS DAY IS NAMED,</p>
<p>AND ROUSE HIM AT THE NAME oF CRISPIAN,”</p>
<p>MY THANKS AND THE Navy&#x27;s THANKS FOR A JOB WELL DONE,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>—;<br>or<br>ae.</p>
