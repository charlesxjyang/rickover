      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In remarks delivered at a dinner in New London, Connecticut, on January 16, 1961, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover celebrated the keel laying of the new submarine USS LaFayette. The speech paid tribute to outgoing Secretary of the Navy William B. Franke for his support of nuclear propulsion and US strength. Rickover then addressed the French Ambassador, Hervé Alphand, emphasizing the LaFayette&#x27;s symbolism of the deep historical and ongoing alliance between France and the United States, tracing it from the American Revolution to shared principles of the &quot;Atlantic Civilization.&quot; He underscored France&#x27;s foundational contributions to modern science and engineering, including the work of the Curies, and highlighted the strategic importance of missile-launching submarines in deterring aggression and preserving peace, viewing them as a product of this shared Western intellectual tradition.</p>

        <p>Remarks by vice admiral h. G. Rickover, USN at dinner in honor of his excellency herve alphand, the ambassador of the french republic and the honorable william b, franke, the secretary of the navy new london, connecticut monday - 16 january 1961</p>
<p>‘ T should like to use this occasion to pay tribute to an outstanding American who has served his country well. The keel laying of the LaFayette is symbolic of the revolution in naval warfare ushered in during his administration. He has invariably lent his support to nuclear propulsion as well as to all other measures designed to enhance the strength and prestige of the United States. It is with deep regret</p>
<p>and a sense of personal loss that I witness the relinquishing of his</p>
<p>office by our Secretary, Mr. Franke. May God bless him and his gracious lady. 7</p>
<p>And now Mr. intondaader may I address a few words to you.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate the keel laying of a new submarine; one we have named LaFayette in memory of a man who means a great deal to us, for he symbolizes the help given the thirteen beleaguered colonies by your great country.</p>
<p>Perhaps this ship will some day be of similar help to all of us who belong to the Atlantic Civilization - a civilization that is at pay against chore who would destory our way of life, even at the risk of war, could they but be sure of winning at the first stroke. Our missile launching submarines may render agression sufficiently risky</p>
<p>to preserve peace and permit us to continue living in freedom.</p>
<p>Ss</p>
<p>The alliance of France with the American colonies was more than a military or political compact. We had built here in an empty wilderness a government that incorporated much of what French thinkers of bine Age of Reason had postulated for an ideal State; there were thus bonds between us superior to mere political expedience. So, too, today:</p>
<p>The nations of the West represent an alliance, not merely of military contingents; they are also a union of states subscribing to the same basic principles of domestic and international conduct. The new LaFayette is a complex weapon; she is also something more. Her name</p>
<p>is a symbol of the bonds that join our country to France - spiritually, intellectually, historically. All of us of the West need to nurture these bonds, to aspire to a sense of unity not unlike that which animated medieval Europe and sustained her for a thousand years against the onslought of aggression from the East.</p>
<p>The: ship represents high levels of engineering; here too is a bond that unites us to France and to other Western nations where the bases were laid for modern science and engineering. France as we all know, founded the first great modern engineering school, predecessor of our own institutes of technology that came much later.</p>
<p>Nuclear power itself rests upon work done by the Curies. In many other ways the LaFayette symbolizes that we of the West are all eitizens | in one world of knowledge; that we must continue to stimulate one another spiritually and intellectually. Pursuit of truth through scientific search is the invention of Western civilization; to join our strengths together will create a unity powerful enough to meet any challenge</p>
<p>from whatever source it may. emerge.</p>
