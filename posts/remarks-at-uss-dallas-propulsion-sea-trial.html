      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In remarks delivered on April 20, 1981, Admiral Rickover details the successful completion of the USS Dallas&#x27;s first sea trials, noting the satisfactory performance of its propulsion plant. He extends profound gratitude to the skilled men and women of Electric Boat, who, for over twenty-five years since the USS Nautilus, have been instrumental in building nuclear-powered submarines. Rickover emphasizes that the construction of these vital ships hinges on the diligent work of individual tradesmen, such as welders, pipefitters, and electricians, pointedly dismissing &quot;management&quot; systems as ineffective &quot;public relations gimmicks&quot; that cannot replace proper individual effort. He concludes by commending Commander Ferrier, his officers, and men for their outstanding performance during the trials, asserting that they handled the ship &quot;like veterans,&quot; and encapsulates his message with a quote from the Gospel of John: &quot;You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free,&quot; expressing the nation&#x27;s pride in such a &quot;fine a crew.&quot;</p>

<p>Admiral rickover’s remarks on the dallas sea trials</p>
<p>I want once again to thank and congratulate all of the skilled working men and women of electric boat who built this ship. The dallas 1S an excellently built ship.</p>
<p>For more than twenty-five years electric boat skilled workers have been building nuclear powered submarines, starting with the first one, the USS NAUTILUS. My many years of experience with electric boat and numerous other companies has been that to | successfully build these vital ships, each worker must do his or her job properly, the construction of the dallas and her sister ships depends on welders, pipefitters, electricians, and other © tradesmen - all seeing to it that their own work was correct,</p>
<p>No amount of so called “management” with its sophisticated financial and other systems can or ever have been able to substitute for each worker doing his job correctly. Most of such systems are nothing but personal advertising - public relations gimmicks, ultimately they are always discredited. The gospel of john states:</p>
<p>&quot;You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”</p>
