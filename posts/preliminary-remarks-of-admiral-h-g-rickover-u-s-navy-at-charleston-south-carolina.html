        <p>Preliminary Remarks of Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy at Charleston, South Carolina 13 October 1978</p>
<p>I am glad to be here with the Charleston Council of the Navy League on the 203rd anniversary of the United States Navy. I would like first to Say a few words about your Senators—two of our most highly regarded and respected members of the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Strom Thurmond has served as well in defense of our country as in Congress, On the day war was declared against Germany in 1941, he volunteered for the Army. He was a paratrooper in the Normandy invasion. Before Germany surrendered, he had earned five battle stars and eighteen decorations, medals, and awards, including the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with combat &quot;&quot;v&quot;, the Purple Heart, the | Belgian Order of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre,</p>
<p>His accomplishments speak for themselves, He is a self-made man</p>
<p>who started from scratch. By hard work, strength of character, and inde-</p>
<p>pendence of mind, he attained the highest office in your State, serving as</p>
<p>Governor from 1947 to 1951, Later, in the Senate, he worked his way up to become one of its leading members.</p>
<p>He is a true gentleman, the best of the tradition, with a lifestyle of grace and modesty that requires service, humor, and gentility. His }</p>
<p>values and standards are traditional and imbued with quality. He is forth-</p>
<p>topo - [ae A</p>
<p>right, outspoken in his convictions, strong in his faith and love of country, and consistently speaks out and fights for what he believes to be true and right. I admire him as one of our Nation's leaders; he isamanIam ~“ ~</p>
<p>grateful to know as a friend.</p>
<p>Not many States can claim the honor of having two former Governors representing them in continued political service as Senators.</p>
<p>Senator Hollings also saw combat in the Army during World War IL After serving in the General Assembly and then the State's House of Repre- sentatives, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1954 and Governor in 1958. He was elected to the Senate in 1966,</p>
<p>In the many years that I have known Senator Hollings, he has earned my admiration and respect, His experience on the Appropriations Com- mittee has provided him with a unique vantage point to view our national defense, He is a man dedicated to our country and to our people,</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to make some comments on our Commander in Chief. The American people are more critical of those in high office today than they have been in the past, and it is more important than ever that high officials and the institutions in their charge set the moral tone for our people, Yet, it is easier to point out the flaws and fallacies of a great man than to be one. This attitude often reminds me of Theodore Roosevelt's &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; statement:</p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out</p>
<p>how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might | have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause;</p>
<p>who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid</p>
<p>souls who know neither victory nor defeat,</p>
<p>It takes a great man to stand alone in the &quot;Arena&quot; that is the Office of the Presidency, and President Carter is such a man, He has the patience, the courage, and the quiet authority that enables him to strive and solve the many issues and problems which confront him daily. He brings a spiritual and practical philosophy to the awesome burden that is his alone. And he has the experience, determination, and strength of character, combined with high resolve and patriotism, to perform his duties in the best interest of the United States,</p>
<p>President Carter is a leader who believes we must all accept responsibility; we must all work to restore unity and purpose to the country, so that, together, we can resolve the issues facing us, not only for ourselves</p>
<p>but for those who come after us.</p>
