      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H. G. Rickover&#x27;s &quot;The World of the Uneducated,&quot; delivered in Albuquerque, New Mexico on October 22, 1959, is a scathing critique of American &quot;progressive education&quot; and a passionate defense of traditional, knowledge-based learning. Following an opening tribute to Senator Clinton Anderson, Rickover distinguishes sharply between true &quot;education&quot;—which fosters intellectual growth, self-awareness, and the pursuit of truth—and &quot;training,&quot; focused on vocational skills and &quot;life adjustment.&quot; He argues that the progressive school system, by confusing these aims and de-emphasizing core academic subjects, has produced a functionally illiterate populace (citing 10% functional illiteracy and a 1957 Gallup Poll showing only one in six Americans read a book) unable to think critically or contribute effectively to democracy. Rickover contrasts the U.S. approach with the more rigorous educational systems in Europe and Russia, asserting that America&#x27;s &quot;knowledge gap&quot; threatens its technological power and national survival, referencing John Dewey, Kilpatrick, and the U.S. Office of Education&#x27;s &quot;Life Adjustment for Every Youth&quot; booklet as examples of the misguided philosophy he believes undermines the nation.</p>

        <p>FOR RELEASE ON DELIVERY THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1959 Remarks prepared by VADM H. G. Rickover, USN Assistant Director for Naval Reactors Division of Reactor Development 12 U. S. Atomic Energy Commission and if Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships IA for Nuclear Propulsion Navy Department for delivery at Albuquerque, New Mexico Thursday, October 22; 1959</p>
<p>I am very happy to be here in New Mexico with you, although I don't often venture this far from the ocean.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you about one of my favorite subjects, our educational system. But first I would like to take a. brief moment to pay a birthday tribute to a man who shares my deep interest in education, the man who is responsible in more ways than one for my being here today, your own Senator Clinton Anderson.</p>
<p>— There is no need for me ‘to recount his career in detail to you, because you know it better than I. How he came to New Mexico at the age of 22, suffering from biberculestes how he conquered his illness and spent what I happen to know were four of the happiest years of his\life as a reporter on the Albuquerque Journal. How he served with distinction as a state official, a United States Representative, \and Secretary of Agriculture. And how he is now</p>
<p>concluding his ‘second term as one of the \most dedicated and</p>
<p>influential members of the Senate. He has ‘also found time to</p>
<p>run a successful business and to become an acknowledged expert on Southwestern history.</p>
<p>But Clinton Anderson's greatest contributions to his country, I think, have been made in: the last eight years through his position as a member and chairman of. the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. It is in this capacity that I have come to know him, and to acquire the deepest admiration and respect for him.</p>
<p>The still-young atomic age, which was born in your own state of New Mexico owes Clinton Anderson a debt which can never be repaid. For eight years he has battled to provide the United States with the atomic tools to enable our country to realize the full potential of nuclear energy.</p>
<p>Because of Clinton Anderson! 5 help we today have shippingport, the world's first civilian power reactor. Under his chairmanship the Joint. ‘Committee has held valuable hearings on such subjects as the effects of radioactive fallout, \aisposal of radioactive wastes, the possible consequences of &amp; nuclear war, and other erucial questions of the atomic age--the printed records of these hearings represent the &quot;Bibles&quot; of the field. Clinton Anderson coauthored the valuable Price-Anderson Bill providing indemnity</p>
<p>insurance mal atomic reactor accidents. His leadership resulted ; ‘</p>
<p>in the 1958 amendments to the Atomic Energy Act to permit the</p>
<p>exchange of nuclear information and materials With our allies. He has waged a continuing campaign against unnecessary secrecy in</p>
<p>\ atomic energy, particularly where the health and walfare of the</p>
<p>citizenry is concerned. @</p>
<p>To me, of course, his greatest achievement has been his devotim to the cause of the nuclear Navy. Because of his unfailing support, the United States as yet possesses the world's only fleet of nuclear submarines--the one field in which we can claim Supremacy over Russia.</p>
<p>In my efforts to obtain more and better atomic vessels, I have always known that I could count on the wholehearted backing of Clinton Anderson, and I would like to take this occasion to express my deep gratitude to him.</p>
<p>New Mexico is indeed fortunate to have a citizen like Clinton Anderson. Let us all congratulate him as he celebrates his 64th birthday. |</p>
<p>And now, back to the main topic of my talk here today--education.</p>
<p>For some years a debate over American education has been going on which threatens to deteriorate into fruitless wrangling.</p>
<p>With increasing determination, one side defends a status quo in which it has a vested interest; the other urges vainly that the rights of America's children and the survival of the nation in freedom and prosperity must be placed above this narrow self-interest. Let us try to get back to fundamentals. What do we conceive education to be and how does the educated person differ from the uneducated? What do we expect our tax-supported public schools to do for our children? What part in raising youngsters to adulthood is properly their province? Let us try to segregate from the bitter battle over methods, standards, democratic versus class education, and similar generalities, the real issue that divides those who represent what we may term the &quot;traditional&quot;</p>
<p>viewpoint on education from those who represent what may be termed</p>
<p>the &quot;progressive&quot; viewpoint. The title of this is &quot;The World of the 'Uneducated'.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish through this title to emphasize the two sides of un-education which are often confused: first, the effect which lack of education</p>
<p>has.on the individual's comprehension of the world around him and 3:</p>
<p>on his ability to make a personal success; second, the effect . upon the world of the attitudes and actions of uneducated people-- specifically, the effect upon a democratic society of the manner in which the &quot;uneducated&quot; person carries out his duties as a citizen. By “uneducated&quot; I mean persons who have not obtained what in Western civilization is termed an &quot;education&quot;.</p>
<p>Education is but one of the two processes by which children. are guided into adulthood; the other is training. Unless we clearly :</p>
<p>understand the distinction between education and training, we will</p>
<p>not discover why our expensive educational plant produces so little.</p>
<p>genuine education compared to schools in other Western countries, and in Russia. Right here, the traditionalist parts company with = the progressive. The traditionalist sees the distinction clearly, | the progressive does not. In the opinion of the traditionalist, confusion of education with training is one of the main reasons for the poor performance of our schools. It may be mentioned in - passing that the progressive philosophy of education, in particular its equation of education with training, is a uniquely ——_—</p>
<p>aN</p>
<p>American phenomenon and a very recent one, too. For a time Russian educators took over much of this theory but it was dropped | there 25 years ago when they found that progressive education did | not really &quot;educate&quot;; nor has the theory been accepted in the</p>
<p>school system of any other advanced modern nation.</p>
<p>As understood in the west education goes to the whole of a man's personality, and seeks to raise, enrich and expand it by | widening his intellectual horizon; training, in contrast, m merely a con seeks to fit the young into the particular society into which a</p>
<p>they have been born. Let me elaborate: os</p>
<p>Education is directed towards enlargement of the individual's</p>
<p>comprehension of the world poy giving him the knowledge and the</p>
<p>mental capacity to understand what lies beyond the narrow sphere ne</p>
<p>of his personal experience and observation. It familiarizes him yen</p>
<p>with events and people, distant in time or space, 80 that he can form independent judgments on social manifestations. It renders intelligible to him the physical world and the laws of nature, : so that he can judge man's potentialities and anitations-aewe |</p>
<p>place in nature.</p>
<p>Training, on the other hand, develops in youth such character</p>
<p>traits as are deemed desirable by the predominant ethical and</p>
<p>religious beliefs of the community ,and teaches socially approved</p>
<p>- peasnaererpgeiy yrea~ st y 5-9 emanate</p>
<p>habits in manners, mores, and personal appearance. Such formation</p>
<p>of attitudes and habits can properly be called “life adjustment&quot;</p>
<p>or adjustment to the “peer group&quot;, to borrow favorite expressions of progressive education. Training also develops vocational skills which qualify one to earn his living as a skilled worker or technician doing a specific type of routine work.</p>
<p>As in all human activities, the mind comes into play when one is trained, but training does not stretch the mind; the intellect 4s not improved by acquiring habits or learning mechanical aki its; ;</p>
<p>nor will routine work of itself enlarge one's mental capacities,</p>
<p>as will hard thinking. Anyone who has ever tackled a difficult” °°” subject such as higher mathematics, and used it to solve seis _ problems, knows that he has emerged from this experience with a oa mind that functions better. Thereafter, he will find it easter tow tackle other subjects and other problems because his mental capacity&quot; has grown, In contrast, neither learning to typewrite, nor spending — years pounding a typewriter, makes him better able to reasong-pbither has an effect on the quality of his intellect. er ene His intellect is but one facet of the child's personality</p>
<p>which must be developed. The traditionalists do not claim that. there are not others which require training. What they Stress is that both education and training are needed to guide young people into adulthood, but that in a five-hour day, and a 180-day school year, it is impossible for our schools to do both. Traditionally, | training has been the responsibility of family and church; much</p>
<p>of it comes about merely through a young person's experiences in</p>
<p>Ht</p>
<p>growing up--training is to a large part the progressive educationists? &quot;learning through living&quot;. But education is &quot;learning through instruction&quot; and properly the province of educational institutions. Most parents and various other agencies are able to give training,</p>
<p>but few parents and no other public agencies, except Schools are</p>
<p>able to give instruction. Except in boarding schools, there is</p>
<p>not enough time for teachers to take on the entire job of raising — our children. We cannot abdicate our responsibilities to them,</p>
<p>nor allow the teachers to take them off our shoulders against our will, It is impossible for our schools to educate &quot;the whole chia&quot;;</p>
<p>their attempt to do so has failed, and our children are neither. .</p>
<p>well educated nor--unless parents have taken a hand--even well trained. Parents, church, community, and school--all: are needed for the job of raising our children. ,</p>
<p>_ Though we love them dearly, candor forces us to admit that newborn babies are ignorant, selfish, ruthless little savages. If they were left to grow up without adult guidance--no matter how well-cared for they might be physically--twenty years hence they would still be ignorant, selfish and ruthless. The only change would be, that what at birth was an appealing little savage would by then have become a not so appealing big savage.</p>
<p>In every society above the level of savagery the adult community join forces to raise their young so that they will</p>
<p>outgrow the self-centered world of babyhood. By what one might</p>
<p>“3-11</p>
<p>-eall an over-all house-breaking program, the baby is gradually adjusted to the society which was fashioned by his forbears. He 4s taught personal habits which make him pleasant to have around; he is conditioned to fit smoothly into a way of life which the adult community wishes to perpetuate.</p>
<p>Every child needs training for adulthood. But important as training is, it will not dispel the ignorance of the newborn babe and tur him into an &quot;educated&quot; adult. It is true that children are usually given a considerable amount of education in the home, but while this was sufficient in pre-industrial societies it is rarely so in modern nations. Education, for the most part, must come through formal instruction in schools. |</p>
<p>In all countries belonging to the civilization of the West-- even those only marginally attached to it--the idea of what</p>
<p>constitutes education has been permanently shaped by the glorious pee</p>
<p>Greek concept that the pursuit of knowledge is man's noblest activity. Let us not forget that all of the West's fabulous victories over grinding human labor, disabling disease, and burdensome superstition grew out of the Greek belief in the value of knowledge and of reasoning based on knowledge. This</p>
<p>respect for knowledge led the West--and only the West--to Anvent</p>
<p>educational institutions dedicated to preservation and increase coal</p>
<p>of knowledge, and to transmission from generation to generation of knowledge, and of the ability to use knowledge. This is why--</p>
<p>despite interruptions of dark ages, wars, revolutions, famines,</p>
<p>plagues,and all kinds of civic disturbances--the civilization of the West has gone on building knowledge upon knowledge, thereby expanding man's understanding of himself and of the world he lives in, and promoting his ability to put the forces cf nature to good use for himself. |</p>
<p>The task of educational institutions in the West has always —</p>
<p>been threefold: first, to pass on the accumulated knowledge of</p>
<p>the past; second, to develop youth in mind and body so that they - ah</p>
<p>will be able to absorb what is already known and to apply it to</p>
<p>the myriad problems of life; third, to encourage the creatively ot endowed to pioneer beyond the frontiers of knowledge, and thereby © _ to increase the existing store of knowledge. No other civilization</p>
<p>ever invented institutions serving this threefold purpose, though &gt;</p>
<p>many have now copied western education.</p>
<p>As conceived in the West, education resembles nothing so much ae</p>
<p>as a lighting of lamps in the minds of the young. These lamps are lighted by a torch handed down through the generations, all the : way back to the sources of our civilization. As the lamps are lighted, one by one, different sections of the world become distinct and comprehensible. Time, cost, and mental endowment control</p>
<p>the number of lamps that are lighted for each individual. The more the better, but even a single lamp is worth more than any number</p>
<p>of pleasant habits or mechanical skills which may at first glance</p>
<p>appear more “useful&quot;.</p>
<p>oe = : —</p>
<p>: a 3</p>
<p>Acquisition of an elementary education that enables one to</p>
<p>read and write enriches personal life, and makes one a more competent person than do social poise or being handy with tools. It is tragic that not a few American youngsters graduate from high school without being truly literate~-some ten percent of our people are estimated to be functionally illiterate. Without literacy one eannot communicate with others from whom he is separated by time or space, nor enjoy the treasures locked in good books. Literacy is basic . to education, yet our schools have not succeeded in teaching all</p>
<p>our children to read with ease, to spell correctly, to write grammatically, and to express themselves clearly in writing.</p>
<p>For years I have asked foreign educators: &quot;How many of your children do you believe to be similarly deficient?* Their answers range from a categorical &quot;none&quot;, to &quot;very few&quot;--children who live too isolated to get to school regularly or those who have a very | low intellect. In most advanced nations eight to nine-year schooling has been compulsory for a century or more. Besides much else, children there have certainly learned to master the mother tongue; thus they have acquired the key which can open up to them all the self-education obtainable through good books. This mastery and this key not a few of our own average and below average children never obtain, although they go to school twelve</p>
<p>years. Even some whose minds are good .¢ ough for college still</p>
<p>require remedial courses in English! ie</p>
<p>Abroad, schools above the elementary level, whether for the slow learner or the talented youth who may later prepare for a | professional career, all concentrate on providing a liberal | education which balances the humanities and the sciences. Through i such an education young people are given a foundation in the specialized knowledge that deals with Man and with Nature. The lamps that light up mental concepts about ‘man include history</p>
<p>which illuminates the past and thus makes current events</p>
<p>comprehensible; economics which familiarizes us with the material bases of our existence; anthropolgy which contributes to our understanding of the slow march of mankind from primitive tribe to modern society; foreign languages and literatures which give. uel insight into the psyche of other people who have contributed | The lamps that light up mental concepts about Nature and the .</p>
<p>Universe include mathematics which clarifies our comprehension of</p>
<p>quantity and relations of masses and thus gives us a foundation</p>
<p>for understanding science; geography and geology which give us a clear idea of the physical shape of the earth and its Limitations within which we must order our lives; the exact sciences which</p>
<p>give us an insight into ways to make nature our servant. Set apart from knowledge which is an intellectual concept, are art and music; these too belong to liberal education. They enable us to enjoy leisure by leaving our humdrum lives behind, soaring into</p>
<p>imaginative worlds.</p>
<p>None of this enrichment of life is accessible to the .</p>
<p>uneducated person. All require long and sustained effort. For</p>
<p>most people study is hard enough under skillful and scholarly | instruction; to make up for educational deprivation suffered in | school, by acquiring an education entirely on one's own, requires | rare drive and perserverance. Relatively few will achieve it.</p>
<p>The traditionalist case against those who now run.our schools. | is that by concentrating on training they have short-changed the</p>
<p>education of our children. They have given up too soon trying to</p>
<p>educate slow learners and children with little desire for learning, an and they have steered them into training before they have absorbed</p>
<p>much more than an elementary education. A principal reason for</p>
<p>doing this has been confusion of education with training; this shows. .. up clearly in the official dogma that there is no hierarchy among . sub jects--that homemaking 4s as valuable as history, manners as wtliet4t</p>
<p>mathematics. Homemaking and manners belong to training; history</p>
<p>Pl ra</p>
<p>and mathematics to education. All, however, count anemesh towards</p>
<p>a high school diploma, and the child is in large part free to choose among them. The freedom given children to plan their own course of study is part of the progressive belief that schools must be child-centered-- a fantastic concept when you think it through. How can a child, | | born ignorant, know what 4t needs to learn? How can we leave him to his own devices and refuse him the loving guidance that trains and educates him for adulthood? By what tortured thinking</p>
<p>have progressives come to believe that democracy in the classroom ought to turn the teacher from an instructor who imparts knowledge to the ignorant, into a “pesources&quot; person who is merely a senior | comrade in a group engaged in studying what the children have</p>
<p>agreed would be fun to study?</p>
<p>Kilpatrick, chief disciple of John Dewey, the father of ah ob. | progressive education, and who has probably influenced children. .</p>
<p>and teachers even more than the latter, was “adamant that the</p>
<p>teacher should not make a practice of substituting his- purposes and wishes forthe echila's,.&quot; His biographer reports that Kilpatrick felt, SAE TS the child and the children who should originate tasks “ana purposes. The best and richest learnings</p>
<p>result only when self-propelled interests are being carried out...</p>
<p>For that reason he wanted no curriculum set in advance, nor did he want teachers to 'sell! or foist subject matter on the child.&quot; He feared that if standards of academic achievement were set,</p>
<p>&quot;there is the ever-present and inherent danger that the child</p>
<p>will be coerced, and coercion ‘seldom builds desirable habits! .&quot; 47</p>
<p>In its widely distributed booklet, &quot;Life Adjustment for Every Youth,&quot; the U. S. office of Education sets goals for secondary education which are almost wholly non-intellectual. The Office apparently subscribes to the belief that three fifths of our</p>
<p>children are incapable of absorbing a genuine education or, for</p>
<p>that matter, even of becoming skilled technicians. It therefore</p>
<p>advocates life-ad ustment education for all children. This</p>
<p>4s defined as &quot;that which better equips all Amersqen outh to live democratically with satisfaction to themselves and profit</p>
<p>to society as home members, workers, and citizens Among some fourteen specific goals of life-adjustment education, one searches in vain for recognition that education deals with the intellect. Hostility to the traditional subjects of secondary education. ===, 4s evident throughout the pamphlet, as it is in almost all the writings of progressive educationists. For the past ten years, I have been collecting pertinent statements</p>
<p>| revealing this attitudes from these I choose at random the following--none of them unusual; all of them typical of progressive thinking. ae)</p>
<p>On literacy, John Dewey has this to say: wwhat avail is ites. to win ability to read and write if in the process the individual loses his own soul; loses his appreciation of Ture worth while,</p>
<p>of the values to which these things are relative.&quot; Ne wonder, the principal of 4 junior high school some years ago publicly challenged the prime purpose of school 4 which is to make our children literate, with the statement nat, &quot;we shall some day accept the thought that it is just as 4llogical to assume that every boy must be able to read as it is that each one must be able to play the violin, that it is no more reasonable to require that each girl shall spell well than 4t is that each one shall bake a good cherry pie.&quot; eee, che |</p>
<p>- Kilpatrick's blogeapher quotes him-as saying of arithmetic:</p>
<p>LA Pr tt nd a lot of people who don't use arithmetic; and I don't</p>
<p>think that life would igo richer for then they peed Ito</p>
<p>They just don't need 11! of modern Languages y Woon the average atudent it Fig7a great waste of time, In terms of rich, vital interests that might lead to individual growth, languages offer meager possibilities.&quot; EL « |</p>
<p>No wonder that we have co Areve professors who state that Greek or Latin are not as useful as knowing how to drive or take a car apart, or that Kilpatrick's biographer reports having seen &quot;a class of six hundred and more graduate students in education, comprising teachers, principals, superintendents, vote their opinion in overwhelming numbers that Greek, Latin, and mathematics offered the least likely possibilities for educational growth; and with almost the same unanimity they placed dancing, dvamatics, and doll playing high on the list in this regard.&quot;</p>
<p>In progressive thought, the school no longer lights the lamps of knowledge; its primary pusiness, in Dewey's opinion, 4s to train children in cooperative and mutually helpfull living. ‘So trained iy would then presumably answer the ideal set by Kilpatrick wid &quot;Wanted each person so to live and so to do that what he wanted and sought that was good for himself and for his</p>
<p>family he should want and seek to make available to every other</p>
<p>person and every other family.&quot; maa —_ pis</p>
<p>Progressive dogma has sold out the American dream that in this country the best of education should be free to every child, since what we are giving the majority of our children is rarely education above the elementary level--education which has for a century and more been free and compulsory in all advanced Western</p>
<p>nations. The best of education now costs more money here and</p>
<p>takes three to four years longer to obtain than in other democracies</p>
<p>and in totalitarian Russia; abroad, even professional education is</p>
<p>either free or costs so little that few are barred by poverty.</p>
<p>This would at all times constitute a serious indictment of</p>
<p>our schools. It is doubly so at present, when education determines - |</p>
<p>technological power; when our adversary in the technological race puts about as many of his ehildren through a rigorous ten-year school devoted to educating them in the humanities, mathematics and the sciences as we put of ours through high school, where a majority receive little more than elementary education. It is true that lately we have begun to toughen curricula a bit, but the knowledge gap between Russian and American youngsters remains wider than we can safely tolerate. I contend that we cannot</p>
<p>allow ourselves to forget the Russian educational challenge for</p>
<p>a Single moment. No amount of talk about the ruthless exploitation of talent by Russia's rulers and the alleged advantages of &quot;educating the whole child&quot; can change the ominous significance</p>
<p>of these figures.</p>
<p>Today technological advances are rarely brought about through purely mechanical skill, which merely improves known techniques through ingenuity of manipulation; it comes through the ability of talented, well educated persons with highly developed professional skills to apply known principles to unforeseen problems ,and through this to derive new principles, and so on ad infinitum. Existing knowledge is the foundation upon which new knowledge is built; pure speculation without a foundation of knowledge will not get us far. The country that has the greatest number of genuinely educated people must inevitably win out in the end. Those who prevent our schools</p>
<p>from really educating our youth undermine the foundations of our ; | freedom and national power. These are harsh words but they are the absolute truth.</p>
<p>Yet in the debate about the kind of education our tax-supported _ schools ought to provide, we must never forget that ina democratic society there is no conflict between the interest of the individual in obtaining the personal advantages that come from being educated jand those of the nation in having educated citizens, To dismiss our educational inferiority vis-a-vis the Russians by saying that our schools are concerned only with the happiness of the individual whereas Russian schools are concerned only with producing useful Soviet citizens is to dwell on</p>
<p>4iprelevancies. A clear understanding of education and a thorough</p>
<p>knowledge of history would prevent such confused thinking. The educational debate now going on bogs down in irrelevancies because it is muddied by the posture of the progressive educationists who equate their kind of life-adjustment education with democracy, and the traditionalist's kind of education with aristocarcy or totalitarianism. ©</p>
<p>This is historically incorrect. Authoritarian Prussia was one of the first states to establish free compulsory elementary education--antedating by almost a century. such education in parliamentary England and democratic Americas; she also supported inexpensive academic secondary schools earlier than other more democratic countries. Of the nations of Europe where everyone could read and write many decades before this skill became universal in other countries--including our own--some were absolute or constitutional monarchies, others limited or absolute democracies. The world's oldest living democracy--Switzerland-- provided education for all its children earlier than the world's second oldest--the United States. Japan--certainly no democracy before World War II--has fewer illiterates than we. Education like art, music, and science is a cultural activity which is not necessarily dependent on a country's particular form of government. When it is conceived of as transmission of knowledge in the humanities and the sciences, and as a process.of developing the power of the intellect, then education has in it an element of universality; then it can be compared, and one country can learn</p>
<p>from another.</p>
<p>One might think that everyone would agree that such a</p>
<p>comparison is possible as well as useful. But this is unacceptable to American educationists. They confuse the issue in the current educational debate by arguing about what is and what is not democratic in education, as witness the following statement made by a prominent educationist before a Committee of the United BE teR Senate: &quot;Good teaching of reading beyond the fundamentals...is | on one thing in a society where a person is being prepared to read. ‘-and instantaneously believe government propaganda, and it isan entirely different thing in a society where a person may be | expected to enjoy the privilege of reading a free press.&quot;</p>
<p>The real issue of course is that by their expertmentation with newfangled ideas about as simple a task as teaching children to read, progressive educaticnists have brought us to the intolerable situation where many American children--after twelve years of schooling--cannot read well at all. Many high school students have only fourth or fifth grade redding ability. Abroad, the teaching of reading and writing is accomplished without fanfare, why not here? What-adults will read is a rather academic question if many of our children cannot read with ease. That Russian schools--as other European schools--teach children to read has probably much to do with the fact, commented upon by many American observers, that Russians are avid readers of solid books--classics and textbcoks--whereas we are not. A 1957</p>
<p>Gallup Poll found that only one in six Americans was reading a</p>
<p>-w- /9</p>
<p>book. I have no figures on Russia, but in England over half the</p>
<p>population are pébk readers.</p>
<p>It is time we abandon fake alibis and recognize that democracies are not invariably and automatically more deeply concerned with educating their children than authoritarian governments; and that since teaching French or algebra does not lend itself to propaganda, we might well study more successful teaching methods used abroad, even if they have been devised by | nations whose form of government or way of life is distasteful to us. Wild statements by educationists trying to minimize the Russian educational menace by dwelling upon the different role of the individual in totalitarian Russia as compared to democratic America make the debate frustrating to all who wish to sneppsuce the light of reason into educational dogmatism.</p>
<p>What effect does education have on the indivudual, and why is the uneducated person less competent to perform his duties as a citizen? . Before I answer this, let me say that to be uneducated is of course not equivalent to being unintelligent-- | indeed, it is my contention that many people who have mental | ability remain uneducated because of the failure of schools to educate them. An uneducated person may be intelligent or not,</p>
<p>a religious man or not, a good family man and helpful neighbor or not, a person with pleasant manners and sensitivity to others</p>
<p>or not--these attributes have nothing to do with being educated.</p>
<p>Pas RO</p>
<p>Since only through education can we comprehend the world around us, it follows that the uneducated are severly handicapped in judging matters requiring a foundation of solid knowledge. In a democracy the people rule and it is imperative that they be educated enough to rule well. But, apart from lack of knowledge,</p>
<p>the uneducated individual who has passed through one of our</p>
<p>life-adjustment schools is likely to be deficient in subtler</p>
<p>ways: For one thing, his schooling will not have given him re</p>
<p>self-awareness, Since this is acquired through the process of education itself, Through it the individual comes in contact with great minds; he cannot help realizing that his own mind</p>
<p>4s inferior to theirs. He constantly meets objective tests</p>
<p>which show up his own limitations and assets. Out of this experience comes self-awareness, the ability to stand off and assess one's capacities as if he were judging a stranger. One is therefore less apt to meddle in things he cannot understand than a person who has not been educated.</p>
<p>The uneducated tend to overvalue their own abilities, Never having experienced the travail of obtaining an education, they rarely understand how much one must know before one can handle © intricate problems. Bécause they feel as able as anyone else to concern themselves with such problems, the uneducated may delay important activities. Through their interference, they may prevent others from doing vitally necessary work. The</p>
<p>core markt arpa AAZE</p>
<p>uneducated endanger democracy because their meddling and interference render it inefficient; today our survival depends on our being more efficient than the totalitarians.</p>
<p>Even persons who are competent in their particular field, but otherwise deficient educationally, show the same tendency to overvalue their capacity and to interject themselves into areas where they lack competence. Administrators who are uneducated in the whole field of science and technology are presently delaying the building of our nuclear Navy by interfering in technical matters, Many other important technical undertakings</p>
<p>are similarly delayed. Because of their influence, these persons</p>
<p>endanger democracy even more than does the ordinary uneducated citizen who erroneously believes himself competent to handle — matters that require more knowledge than he possesses; they endanger democracy more because they are in the position to do more to make 1t inefficient. | | The schools must bear much of the blame for the insouciance of our uneducated citizens. Future historians may well give ominous significance to so simple a thing as the substitution by proeredatve educationists of a new, so-called SNUX* oand. for the old report card on which a child's scholastic. achievements were clearly marked A to F. The new card used letters *N - More effort should be made</p>
<p>U ~- Unsatisfactory work X - Needs special help</p>
<p>too but they now measured nothing. For example, the letter &quot;sg&quot; stood for &quot;normal growth is taking place&quot; .and it went to the bright boy who consistently solved all the questions in an exam; it also went to the dullard who consistently failed to solve more than a tiny fraction--both were growing &quot;normally&quot;.</p>
<p>Next in importance to self-awareness, which the educated citizen usually acquires but the uneducated usually does not, must be placed ability to view problems with intellectual detachment. Such detachment is another by-product of genuine education, which teaches young people to view truth as an impersonal absolute good, regardless of the effect 1t may have on them personally. To achieve such detachment is difficult, and no one succeeds completely. Perhaps the liberally educated individual and the truly great scientist come closest. We know that great scientists,in particular, have such complete devotion to truth that they will discard a lifetime's work if they find they have gone astray from the truth they seek; they will do this even when they are in no danger of being found out, simply because truth is more important to them than personal consideration. People who regard truth as more important than their personal | welfare are troublesome. They not only annoy everyone who has a vested interest which truth would damage; they irritate the uneducated who rarely feel that strongly about a principle, since. they get it at second hand from persons they like.</p>
<p>To the uneducated, abstract ideas are unfamilar; so is the Getachment that is necessary, out of one's own knowledge and mentel effort, to discover a truth. The uneducated person must mecessarily view life in an intensely personal way~-he knows only what he sees, hears, or touches and what he is told by persons he likes. Detachment is possible for him only in the form of total disinterest. Everything that interests him, he personalizes. As the unknown sage puts its &quot;Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people&quot;,</p>
<p>How does the world look to the uneducated? It lacks the clarity that comes when the torch of knowledge has illuminated the world. To the uneducated, the world is hazy, haphazard, and full of mysterious powers which he does not comprehend and, ~ therefore, fears; events impinge upon him singly, and he cannot see their interconnections; he lacks the foundation of knowledge without which opinions are worthless; his views tend to be arbitrary surpori tions, emotionally determined guesses, or parroted cliches. But above all, he differs from the educated person in having no other way of observing people, events, and issues than through his own Senses, nor of judging them except by emotional preference. |</p>
<p>Disraeli once remarked that England was two nations--the rich and the poor. Technology with its fantastic machine-made productivity has all but fused the two, but technology with its</p>
<p>dependence on highly trained professional people to manage society and push it forward has created a new division--that between the educated and the uneducated. They are poles apart. The gap is greatest between the uneducated person and the intellectual, in particular the true scientist. | That is one reason why the</p>
<p>uneducated distrust and fear them. That is why there is popular -</p>
<p>dislike for the &quot;egghead&quot; and the &quot;brain&quot;, and general acceptance |</p>
<p>of that ridiculous stereotype of the &quot;cold&quot; scientist who cares ©</p>
<p>nothing for people but only for scientific laws. The uneducated</p>
<p>mistakes the scientist's detachment in matters of seience for</p>
<p>lack of warmth In his human relations--a natural error for people</p>
<p>who cannot conceive of the world as anything but a PERSONAL world. His personalizing of all issues makes the uneducated individual</p>
<p>the implacable enemy of critics. He carries his personal dislike</p>
<p>of being criticized--nagged at, he calls it--into the public arena;</p>
<p>instinctively, he will always favor the status quo,for he likes to keep everything snug and running comfortably in accustomed grooves. It is true that he doesn't mind innovations in goods and services; he is quickly persuaded by the nursery rhymes of the radic or TV commercial which tell him that a new article is better than an</p>
<p>old one. But when it comes to new ideas, the uneducated shows terrific sales resistance. Thinking comes much harder to him</p>
<p>than going out to buy a new product,</p>
<p>Sami taal</p>
<p>In a democracy which depends upon popular decision in many complicated matters, public debate is essential to the clarification of issues. But debates will deteriorate into rancorous wrangling when there is no meeting ground between those who represent opposite views, This happens all too often when the uneducated confront the educated. The former have no intellectual support for their opinions and So cannot defend them rationally against adversaries who argue on the basis of fact, knowledge, and reason, The uneducated possess but one weapon--the lash of invective; they eannot argue on the level of facts and ideas, so they stoop to personal vilification, When a democracy has too many uneducated citizens their very presence will tend to debase public debates and turn them into personality contests. The uneducated will give their vote to people who by their appearance and oratory most closely approach a national ideal; they will vote for one or another solution to a national problem on the basis of their subjective liking for the person who advocates this solution. Democracies can tolerete the conflict of groups pursuing enlightened self-interest; but when self-interest is not enlightened, it will destroy the nation.</p>
<p>One of the great dangers to society when it has too many uneducated people is that their inability to view error with intellectual detachment prevents early diagnosis of national</p>
<p>nletakes ,and quick remedial action. The truly educated man</p>
<p>can admit his mistakes without feeling that his personal worth has been diminished; the uneducated man cherishes his mistakes and grasps them with all the more determination when others point them cut. To him the critic is an enemy who attacks him by &quot;showing him up&quot;, This possessiveness about errers the uneducated carry into public debates where they rise in anger to defend national cliches, slogans, and illusions against anyone who urges that these unsupported beliefs be ahandosed and truth be faced. The uneducated has made these fancies his own ,and they support him. |</p>
<p>To him the critic's action, if not outright treason, is at</p>
<p>for which the attacker must be punished. “If you don't like it here, why don't you go somewhere else?” This is his response to the critic of any aspect of the American way of life. Proof of love, to the uneducated, is that it finds no fault with what he loves. Such is his own love for his children. He wants to make life easy for them and give them all their hearts desire. They are perfect as they are. Transposing this concept cf love to a man's feeling for his country, he accepts only unquestioning approval of the status quo as evidence of real love; te question its perfection, he feels, is disloyal.</p>
<p>Yet true devotion does not exclude criticism of the loved one.</p>
<p>As indulgence of children will stop them from growing to spiritual,</p>
<p>emotional, and intellectual maturity, so unwillin ess to criticize the status quo will stop us from progressing and, convect our dynamic society into a static one. When he vilifies the critic, the uneducated person does not realize that, should he succeed, he would destroy that very dynamism which is the essential characteristic of Western civilization and the secret of its superiority over other civilizations, not only in material prosperity but also in compassion for those in need of help.</p>
<p>We have talked about American education long enough. It is time we take steps to improve it so that prevailing misconceptions of what the school should do will cease to keep our children from becoming educated persons. Too many of our schools are glittering workshops where the scholastic pursuit has become marginal, and training is the essential goal. Let us turn them 4nto institutions devoted to education, with training given only such marginal status as it has traditionally had---sewing for the girls, perhaps. some mechanical training for the boys. Let - stop our schools from diverting children from genuine education to learning how to dress, shop, telephone, cook, Grive, or find a mate. These skills may give them an attractive packaging, but should we not be more concerned with giving our children solid odntent? This cannot be done any other way than by lighting the</p>
<p>lamps of knowledge.</p>
<p>We must be clear in our minds that the educational debate now going on turns on the basic question whether our tax supported school system shall light these lamps or merely improve a child's outer shell and teach him some vocational skills. I myself, and with me many other critics of American education, believe that ‘every child must be educated as far as 4s humanly pessible. Each child must have at least one lamp lighted for him. Even though 4t be but one--or perhaps two or three--part of the world around him will cease to be hazy, haphazard and controlled by mysterious and fearsome powers. And as the world is illuminated for him, he becomes to that extent educated. To bring this about is worth any amount of effort and expenditure, both for the sake of the children</p>
<p>we cherish ,and of the country we love. _ a ae al</p>
