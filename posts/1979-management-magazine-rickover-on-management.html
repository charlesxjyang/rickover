      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1979 article, &quot;In Government Management,&quot; Admiral Hyman Rickover expresses skepticism about teaching management through theory, asserting that true skills stem from &quot;long personal experience and hard work.&quot; He critiques a prevalent lack of public trust in the Federal Government, which he attributes to a post-World War II increase in &quot;managers and checkers&quot; over &quot;doers,&quot; fostered by a &quot;new management&quot; philosophy that prioritizes superficial people-handling over deep knowledge and accountability. To counter this, Rickover outlines nine core principles derived from his 50 years of service: fostering a sense of &quot;Ownership&quot; and full &quot;Responsibility&quot; for one&#x27;s job; emphasizing &quot;Attention to Detail&quot;; setting clear &quot;Priorities&quot;; maintaining a thorough understanding of &quot;what is going on&quot; through diligent effort rather than &quot;management information systems&quot;; demonstrating &quot;Hard Work&quot;; ensuring quality through &quot;Checking up&quot; and &quot;Formality&quot; in communications; and courageously &quot;Facing the Facts,&quot; even when it means making difficult changes. Rickover concludes by warning that a failure to adopt these substantive principles over &quot;glib &#x27;management techniques&#x27;&quot; could lead to a &quot;taxpayers revolt.&quot;</p>

        <p>IN GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>By Admiral Hyman Rickover</p>
<p>Author&#x27;s Note:</p>
<p>The following article has been provided in response to a request. I have written it<br>reluctantly, for I realize the futility of expecting that articles such as this will have any<br>impact.</p>
<p>Iam convinced it is impossible to “teach” management in schools, in books, or in<br>articles such as this. | am reminded of the high-ranking military officer who, a number of<br>years ago, had been appointed to head a major Federal Agency in Washington. He<br>advised me he would be in Washington soon and would like to visit me for half an hour to<br>learn how to run a large organization. I told him he could not learn to be king in half an<br>hour, and not to waste his precious time seeing me. The vast majority of readers, those<br>who “believe,” or “hope” or who have been “taught” that there are a few simple<br>principles of management which can be learned, will find my thoughts unconvincing,<br>prosaic, or dated. Perhaps the few who already “know” how to manage or who<br>recognize that the necessary skills can only be developed by long personal experience<br>and hard work, and will take some heart from reading my comments amidst the flood of<br>modern “management double-speak” so prevalent today.</p>
<p>Today the American people have little trust in those who work for the Federal<br>Government. To an extent this lack of confidence is justified, particularly when it<br>involves senior managers. Since the end of World War I1 the number of high grade<br>civilians in relation to the total Government workforce has steadily increased to the point<br>where we have more managers and checkers than we have doers. This increase has been<br>brought about by the purveyors of the “techniques of modem management.” Our senior<br>employees have been schooled in this &quot;new&quot; philosophy which holds that as long as a<br>person is well-versed in the few simple rules of how to handle people and situations, he<br>need not know anything about the details of the programs he is managing or the<br>increasingly sophisticated technologies on which many of these programs are based. This<br>has allowed the non-professional to achieve high status and high pay within the<br>Government. These “managers” can move easily from one position to another without the<br>slightest pause. As long as their areas do not become a public disaster they are safe. If<br>trouble erupts, they are lost; they can then blame those beneath them or those who<br>preceded them. Until this false concept is rooted out of the Federal Government we<br>cannot expect the American people to regain their trust. In deed they should not.</p>
<p>I do not hold much hope for this being done before a major disaster befalls the<br>US. But I can provide some basic principles for doing a job that I have followed for over<br>50 years of government service and which I have instilled in my senior managers. If<br>these principles were emphasized instead of the present ones, it would go a long way<br>toward reversing the current trend. Unfortunately, many of those who have been brought<br>up in the “new management” system will probably never understand the significance of<br>the principles I offer.</p>
<p>1. Ownership</p>
<p>A person doing a job—any job—must feel that he owns it and that he will<br>remain on that job indefinitely. If he feels he is a temporary custodian, or is<br>using the job as a stepping stone to a higher position, his actions will<br>probably not take into account the long-term interests of the country. Lack of<br>commitment to the present job will be perceived to those who work for him<br>and they also will tend not to care. If he feels he owns his job and acts<br>accordingly, he need not worry about his next job. He should exercise a<br>devotion to his work as if his children were the direct beneficiaries of what<br>he is doing, as indeed they are. Too many spend their entire lives looking for<br>the next job. We need to make it challenging and rewarding for managers to<br>remain in one organization for more than a few years. Thereby the<br>organization will benefit from their knowledge, experience, and “corporate”<br>memory.</p>
<p>2. Responsibility</p>
<p>Along with ownership comes the need for acceptance of full responsibility<br>for the work. It is now common in government to deal with problems in a<br>collective way. For example, a program will be divided into component parts<br>or into sub-programs, but with no one responsible for the entire effort.<br>Another approach is to have a committee run the program in some pseudo-<br>democratic form, or to establish more and more levels of managers to<br>theoretically give better control. All of these are but different forms of shared<br>responsibility, and shared responsibility means that no one is responsible.<br>Unless the one person truly responsible can be identified when something<br>goes wrong, then no one has been really responsible.</p>
<p>3. Attention to Detail</p>
<p>A tendency among managers, particularly as they move to higher positions,<br>is to think they no longer need to be concerned with details. If the boss is not<br>concerned about details, his subordinates also will not consider them<br>important. Yet “the devil is in the details.” It is hard, monotonous, and<br>onerous to pay attention to details; most managers would rather focus on<br>lofty policy matters. But when details are ignored, the project fails; no<br>infusion of policy or lofty ideals can then correct the situation. This principle<br>is particularly important in those programs where the application of special<br>skills or technology is needed for success.</p>
<p>4. Priorities</p>
<p>The need to pay attention to details does not mean that you should do everything.<br>Any individual has only so much time to work, with an absolute limit of 24 hours<br>each day. If you are to manage your job you must set priorities. Too many people<br>let the job set the priorities. On any given day, small, unimportant but seemingly<br>“interesting” trivia pass through an office; you must avoid letting these monopolize<br>your time. A tendency of human beings is to while away time with unimportant<br>matters because these do not require mental effort or energy. That is why television<br>is popular. You must apply self-discipline to ensure your energy is focused on<br>where it is most needed.</p>
<p>5. Know what is going on</p>
<p>You must establish simple and direct means to find out what is going on in detail in<br>the area of your responsibility. There are ways of doing this, but all involve<br>constant drudgery. For this reason, most managers avoid keeping up with the<br>details. Instead they create “management information systems.” Gimmicks such as<br>these merely demonstrate you are not able or willing to use the necessary effort on<br>your job. I require regular, periodic reports directly to me from key personnel<br>through out my program. I insist that they report the problems they have found in<br>plain English, and that they report the specific action they are taking, and what<br>assistance they need from me. The concept that the use of complex systems can<br>simplify matters is specious. It may sound attractive but it flies in the face of<br>nature&#x27;s laws, as I have observed them.</p>
<p>6. Hard Work</p>
<p>For this there is no substitute. A manager who does not work hard or devote extra<br>effort cannot expect his people to do so. You must set the example. Hard work<br>compensates for many shortcomings. You may not be the smartest or most<br>knowledgeable person. But if you dedicate yourself to the job and put in the<br>required effort, your people will follow your lead.</p>
<p>7. Checking up</p>
<p>An essential element of carrying out my work is the need to have it checked by an<br>independent source. Even the most dedicated individual makes mistakes. Further,<br>many are less than fully dedicated to their work. In industry an independent check<br>is usually referred to as “quality control” and is widely used in engineering<br>applications. But the concept is valid for more than just engineering. Much poor<br>work and sheer nonsense is generated in government because it is not subjected to<br>impartial review and oversight.</p>
<p>8. Formality</p>
<p>A corollary of the concept of checking work is in the need for formalizing<br>communications and actions. If this is not done, then one is dependent on<br>individual memory which is quickly lost as people leave or move to other<br>jobs. In my work an invaluable feature has been the ability to go back a<br>number of years to determine the basis for an action. In this way an emerging<br>problem can be put into proper perspective, and can facilitate taking the<br>action needed for correction. If actions are not formalized, one can never be<br>sure they are understood or executed.</p>
<p>9. Facing the Facts</p>
<p>Another principle for managing a successful program is to resist the natural<br>human inclination to hope things will work out, despite evidence or doubt to<br>the contrary. This may seem obvious, but it is a factor one must be conscious<br>of and actively guard against. It can have a subtle effect, particularly if the<br>manager has spent much time and energy on a project and has come to feel<br>possessive about it. It is not easy to admit that what you thought was correct<br>did not turn out that way.</p>
<p>If conditions require it, one must face the facts and brutally make needed<br>changed despite considerable costs and schedule delays. The man in charge<br>must personally set the example in this area and require subordinates to do<br>likewise. Figuratively, he must, if necessary, kill his own child, regardless of<br>the consequences to himself. After all, he is the trustee for the Government;<br>he is not the owner.</p>
<p>The principles I have stated may have many ancillary facets that can be<br>further developed. I have merely provided the key elements. I suspect most of<br>those reading this article will give passing acknowledgement and may even agree<br>with the principles. But unless tangible action is taken to put them into practice,<br>they have been of no merit. There is a desperate need in Government for<br>responsible management; for managers who pay attention to substance and not to<br>glib “management techniques.” If there continues to be little movement toward<br>more responsible and effective management along the line I have outlined, it<br>should come as no surprise if the “taxpayers revolt” takes on an increasingly<br>tangible form which extends even into the Federal Government.</p>
