      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address from December 29, 1958, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover accepts the Bicentennial Science Award, dedicating it to those who developed nuclear power. He highlights the profound moral and political responsibility that comes with unlocking atomic energy, emphasizing its dual potential for good and evil and humanity&#x27;s new ability to &quot;change his environment.&quot; Rickover asserts that the only way to master these new forces and avoid becoming their slave is to &quot;raise the level of education of all our citizens,&quot; declaring education the most important national problem. He quotes A.N. Whitehead, stating that &quot;the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed,&quot; and argues that democracy&#x27;s survival depends on citizens embracing &quot;corollary duties&quot; beyond just rights. He concludes by proposing that all professional men should adopt an oath similar to the ancient Athenian &quot;ephebic oath,&quot; promising &quot;to leave his city &#x27;not less but better than he found it.&#x27;&quot;</p>

        <p>Remarks Prepared by VADM H. G. Rickover, USN for delivery at the presentation of the Bicentennial Science Award of the City College Chemistry Alumni Association for Scientific Achievement</p>
<p>Henry Hudson Hotel New York, New York</p>
<p>December 29, 1958</p>
<p>KEKE KERKEK I am deeply honored to receive the Bicentennial Science Award of the City College Chemistry Alumni Association and I accept it in the name of all the men and women who have worked so hard with me to develop nuclear ewer One cannot become involved in an enterprise such as nuclear power without becoming aware of its potentials for good, as well as those for evil. | Now that we have unlocked the energy of the atom, man holds in his own hands the power to change his environment. Up to now, he has been able to accommodate himself to nature, but not to modify it. This power to modify his environment on a scale which can affect all humanity imposes on man a great moral and political responsibility. In attempting to do God's work, God help us if we do not do it wisely. : Atomic power is but one of the new forces which are opening new avenues for the use and convenience of man - or for‘his: destruction. The only way I know whereby we can become master of these new forces and</p>
<p>not their slave, is to raise the level of education of 411 our eitizens.</p>
<p>Education is the most important problem that faces our nation; unless we solve it we will not be able to solve other problems. &quot;civilization is a race between education and catastrophe.” ~</p>
<p>We must realize, as Whitehead said so elegantly: &quot;The rule 4s absolute, the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed. Not all your victories on land or at sea can move back the finger of fate. Today we maintain ourselves. Tomorrow science will have moved forward yet one more step, and there will be no appeal from the judgment which will then be pronounced on the uneducated.&quot; |</p>
<p>“In a democracy the most important duty of the government is to promote the virtue and intelligence of the people. Citizens in a. democracy must be given equal opportunity to become educated. The way in which we discharge this educational responsibility will largely determine our ‘ability. to survive. ,</p>
<p>“But sometimes we forget that democracy is not a matter of rights alone that it depends for’ its very life on acceptance of corollary duties. If democracy meant no more than the right of each citizen to ‘enjoy himself, provided in so doing he harmed no one else, it would be a shabby creed indeed for the people of a great country.</p>
<p>“Democracy igs not merely a political and social device to insure ‘that ‘under a properly elected government each citizen may endoy complete pérsonal freedom, bound only by the equal rights of other : eitizens.. It 4s far more than that. Democracy guarantees everyone</p>
<p>freedom and opportunity to develop his mind and character without</p>
<p>‘bindrance from external sources so that he may put them to use not. ealy for himself but for the community as well,</p>
<p>I should like to see an oath by all professional men something like the ephebic oath sworn by all young Athenians when at the end of two years of preparation and service they become full citizens. Each of these young men - called ephebi - promised solemnly to leave his eity “not less but better than he found it.&quot;</p>
<p>A promise to leave his country not less but better than he found 1t would be a most appropriate beginning for any professional</p>
