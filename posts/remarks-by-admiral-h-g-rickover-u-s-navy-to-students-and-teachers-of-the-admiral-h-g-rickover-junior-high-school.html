      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a resolute address to the students and teachers of the newly-named Admiral H. G. Rickover Junior High School on March 3, 1978, Admiral Rickover underscores education as the nation&#x27;s &quot;first line of defense,&quot; essential for both national security and operating complex technologies like nuclear submarines. The speech outlines core principles for true learning: individual accountability and self-discipline—highlighting it as &quot;work&quot; and not &quot;fun and games&quot; (quoting Thomas Huxley on the ability to do what must be done, whether liked or not)—intellectual responsibility for self-sufficiency, perseverance (citing Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;man&#x27;s reach should exceed his grasp&quot;), and a relentless striving for excellence to avoid mediocrity. Rickover also emphasizes cultivating intellectual habits such as contemplation, curiosity, reading, and critical thinking, asserting that &quot;Ignorance is not bliss—it is oblivion.&quot; He reinforces the student&#x27;s personal agency in learning with an inscription from the Kenneth Sawyer Goodman Memorial Theatre: &quot;You, yourself, must set fire to the faggots which you have brought,&quot; and concludes with an anonymous credo on valuing and utilizing each day for educational gain.</p>

        <p>Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Navy</p>
<p>to wai. d Teachers of the Admiral H. G. RicKover Junior High School Sauk Village, Illinois on</p>
<p>3 March 1978</p>
<p>Several years ago I was told that a school in Illinois was being named the Admiral H. G. Rickover Junior High School. I was both</p>
<p>surprised and honored. It gave me a special sense of pleasure that</p>
<p>could hardly be matched by any other recognition because it is through</p>
<p>education—something I feel deeply about—that our culture and civili- zation is transmitted from one generation to the next. It is therefore a special occasion for me to meet students and teachers from this school.</p>
<p>Since your school is of mutual interest, I will speak on education. You know I have been concerned about schools and education for many years. Whether we like it or not, education is our first line of defense. If we neglect it, our country's security is in danger. In today's advanced technology, we must have intelligent and highly skilled people to operate complex machinery. I can readily cite an example of complex machinery— the nuclear submarine—and the reason the men in these ships must have</p>
<p>intelligence and skill, To achieve these, much depends on the basic</p>
<p>education each man has received and how well he has applied himself to</p>
<p>his studies.</p>
<p>In the short time I have, I will talk about some of the principles to which you must hold yourself accountable in order to acquire an education.</p>
<p>The responsibility for education does not rest entirely on schools and teachers. A teacher can tell students what they should learn and can tell them how to go about learning it. If they have difficulty, the teacher can give extra help or tell them where they can get it. But no teacher can do your learning for you; that you must do for yourself,</p>
<p>There are no easy shortcuts to learning. It can be interesting, rewarding, and exciting, but it is not fun and games; it is work. No learning takes place, just as no ditch gets dug, without work. There- fore, self-discipline is the first principle that is required of the student who wants to succeed in life. Thomas Huxley, an English biologist in</p>
<p>the late 1800's, said:</p>
<p>Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ~ ability to make yourself do the things you have to do,</p>
<p>when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not;</p>
<p>it is the first lesson that ought to be learned; and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last</p>
<p>lesson that he learns thoroughly.</p>
<p>The second principle is intellectual responsibility. Accepting responsibility means that one takes upon himself an obligation to invest the time, effort, and thought required to make creative decisions and participate in a life that has meaning. Everyone should acquire a sense of intellectual responsibility to develop his education so that he is capable of earning a living. This can be accomplished in school or out, and at any level from humble work to highly paid professional skills. Each of us needs to feel, sometime in life, that his services are important enough so that someone other than the welfare department is willing to pay to keep him alive. Those who never prove their usefulness remain forever at a disadvantage, because a sense of responsibility is the basic way in which we can relate to the world.</p>
<p>Another principle one should apply is perseverance. By this I mean the ability to decide on a goal and commit yourself to reaching it. Here I want to remind you of Robert Browning's words: &quot;Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for.&quot; ~</p>
<p>The student with a good education need never be inactive or bored; there is no reason for him to seek refuge in the mundane routine of life. Those who have been led to believe they can achieve without effort; that all they need do in order to obtain a good education is skip blithely down the merry road to learning, are in reality on a road that is no more than a detour to the dead end of ignorance. One of my favorite sayings is</p>
<p>&quot;Ignorance is not bliss—it is oblivion. '' There is no greater tragedy</p>
<p>for young people than to succeed in school without really trying—and then go out into a world in which they are incapable of earning a living.</p>
<p>Becoming an educated person is a difficult, demanding enterprise. Just as anyone who speaks of intense physical training as a continuous source of pleasure and delight may be thought a fool—because we all know how much pain and frustration such training involves—so anyone who speaks of intense mental exertion as a continuous source of happiness should equally be thought foolish, for this effort also involves pain and frustration. The pleasure from athletic or intellectual ability is the result of overcoming true challenges, and this cannot be experienced without toil and perseverance.</p>
<p>A fourth principle—striving for excellence—is one Americans seem to be losing, and at a time when our nation stands in great need of it. Excellence, as I use the word here, means the desire for perfec- tion in one's work. A lack of excellence implies mediocrity. Ina society willing to accept mediocrity, the opportunities for personal failure are boundless, Each of us must avoid being mediocre by trying to accomplish what we do to the best of our ability—not by doing just enough to get by.</p>
<p>Finally, a student must learn how to use his intellect. Intellectual growth and development are necessary to succeed as a useful citizen. Intellectual growth is developed by a number of habits. One of these is</p>
<p>the art of contemplating and thinking—to be able to assimilate thoughts and to form ideas. Another is curiosity—having an interest in the world around us. A third habit to develop is that of reading. By reading books, we grow intellectually and emotionally. I count this habit as one of the most significant of all human efforts. Through reading and its associated skill, writing, we achieve the ability to express complex ideas. Unless we can express our thoughts well, we can exert little influence on our fellowmen.</p>
<p>We must be able to use our minds to weigh evidence; to see inner connections; and to advance toward a final viewpoint. To prepare for the responsibilities of citizenship in a rapidly changing nation and world, we must have a questioning, skeptical mind—as well as one capable of making intelligent decisions.</p>
<p>I have mentioned a few of the principles we must apply to ourselves to obtain a good education and to be of value in our society. Each of you could add many more to the list—courage, moral behavior, a sense of | ethics, and soon. Few of us will ever become, by these standards, fully educated individuals; but at least we can have a modicum of under- standing of the methods needed to attain an education. |</p>
<p>I commend to you the words chiseled in stone on the proscenium of the Kenneth Sawyer Goodman Memorial Theatre in Chicago:</p>
<p>‘You, yourself, must set fire to the faggots which you have brought, &quot; 5</p>
<p>These words should be on every school building to remind students</p>
<p>it is they, not their teachers, who are responsible for their education. And so, each day in school is important because, at this point in</p>
<p>your lives, you shoud be devoting the major part of your time to</p>
<p>acquiring basic knowledge for use in later years. This is a credo</p>
<p>written by a man whose name I do not know:</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a new day. God has given me this day to use as I will. I can waste it or use it for good. What I do today is important, because I'm ex- changing a day of my life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will te gone forever, leaving in its place some- thing I have traded for it. I want it to be gain, not loss; good, not evil; success, not failure; in order that I shall</p>
<p>not regret the price I paid for it.</p>
