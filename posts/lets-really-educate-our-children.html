      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address, Vice Admiral H.G. Rickover argues passionately for a fundamental reform of American education, asserting it &quot;isn&#x27;t good enough&quot; to meet the demands of a complex, competitive world. He contrasts the U.S. school system, which he characterizes by its short school year, wasted hours on &quot;trivia,&quot; and lack of rigorous teacher qualifications, with those of other advanced nations like Europe and Russia. Rickover proposes the establishment of a National Standards Committee to formulate and certify scholastic standards through examinations, akin to English national exams, to foster excellence and combat complacency, citing the &quot;painful shocks&quot; like Sputnik. He references Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s observation on America becoming &quot;crowded,&quot; Dorothy Thompson&#x27;s view on &quot;Democracy,&quot; a 1959 Ford Foundation report on education&#x27;s indispensability, and his testimony to Chairman Clarence Cannon of the House Appropriations Committee, also mentioning the 1956 Water Pollution Act as a precedent for permissive national standards.</p>

        <p>Let's. Really educate our children</p>
<p>H. G@. Rickover Vice Admiral, USN</p>
<p>&quot;Professional&quot; educators often accuse me of wanting to foist a foreign school system on our children. Some are going about the country claiming I intend to &quot;militarize&quot; education. Evidently none have ever read what</p>
<p>I have been saying. My argument is that, whether we look at American</p>
<p>education from the point of view of the kind of educated youth we need in our complex society, or from the point of view of our competitive position in education vis-a-vis other advanced nations, the answer is the same: It just isn't good enough. ' .</p>
<p>Any ‘sensible person recognizing the need for improvement would look</p>
<p>into the ways other democratic nations go about educating their children.</p>
<p>The time is past when we were in the uniquely favorable circumstance of being able to get along with Schools that were markedly inferior to — those of countries with which we were competing economically or politically</p>
<p>or both. Nor do we now have the immense wealth in land and resources that</p>
<p>in the past offset our educational deficiencies. Woodrow Wilson observed half a century ago, &quot;the stage of America grows crowded like the</p>
<p>stage of Europe. The life of the new world grows as complex as the life of the old.&quot; Since then we have doubled our population and made deep</p>
<p>inroads. in our stock of nonrenewabile resources. The conditions of life</p>
<p>in this country daily approach closer to those of the older nations of Europe. Of course, we are still a rich country; our resources still exceed those of Europe and perhaps even of Russia; but we can no longer afford to wasté time and money on an inadequate school system.</p>
<p>What then is to be done to improve American education? Well, local communities and state governments have the power to increase the amount | of classroom instruction per school year. We have the shortest school day and school year among leading nations. They could eliminate from curricula everything that can be learned elsewhere. We are the only advanced country where precious school hours are wasted teaching children how to make fudge, twirl batons, drive cars, budget income, handle the telephone, catch fish, and similar trivia that any reasonably normal person picks up on his own or learns at home. Most important of all, they could improve teacher qualifications, bringing them up to the | level. existing abroad, and they could then put the educational enterprise under the supervision of our best teachers, giving them the necessary clerical’.and administrative assistance. Abroad,where teaching is an honored profession, no one would dream of putting nonteacher administrators in charge of schools. We are the only country where teachers are bossed by educational administrators. who often as not can lay no claim to scholarship, superior intelligence or higher education, and who may not have had experience in classroom teaching.</p>
<p>All this is important but I am convinced that we cannot . put through a really effective reform program unless we set up a national scholastic</p>
<p>standard--a permissive standard, of course--but nevertheless potentially</p>
<p>a great influence for good. Many countries have, at one time or another, discovered their educational systems to be unsatisfactory. I know of none that has. been able to carry out speedy reform without making use of some such standard. Indeed we are the only advanced nation without - a national scholastic standard.</p>
<p>Now the word &quot;standard&quot; has many connotations. I use it in the sens that comes first to mind: a specific requirement or level of excellence deemed worthy of esteem or reward. Not a law, enforceable in the</p>
<p>courts; falling below standard does not put one in jail. Nor a conventior</p>
<p>‘ule imposed by society; failure to meet the standard does not get one</p>
<p>socially ostracized. No one has to live up to the standard. It is simpl}</p>
<p>‘an optional criterion for determining the value of an act or accomplishmer</p>
<p>For those who accept the standard it becomes the yardstick by which the worth of these acts or accomplishments is determined. |</p>
<p>I do not share the pride our educationists take in the fact that we are the only leading nation with a school system that does not challens its children to meet a national scholastic standard in order to receive academic rewards. I do not agree with them that children must not be &quot;judged;&quot; that each child has a right to &quot;equal education and equal status;&quot; hence that, as one superintendent of schools put it, &quot;straight thinking and democratically minded school administrators&quot; will hand out. the same diploma, &quot;regardless of the variation of high school courses and the range of scholastic achievement that are presented by the graduates as evidence of accomplishment.&quot; ‘I think this educator misreads the whole</p>
<p>purpose of academic certificates when he notes with approval that: &quot;No</p>
<p>longer does the diploma in its wording discriminate among the graduates, as was once the case when it carried the name of the course in which the student vent through school, consequently implying that the accomplishments of the youth who did not take the highly academic lane were less worthy.’ ;</p>
<p>Nor do I share educationist concern that children who do not measure up to a standard will suffer pain and lose face. I suggest we set up a standard for different levels of aptitude, but in each case representing not the ' 'average” accomplishment but the &quot;highest&quot; level children of this ability can with effort achieve. . _</p>
<p>All of life is a series of tests. Young people will be better able to take these tests in their stride if at an early age they begin to learn that everything worthwhile requires great effort but that the satisfaction derived from attaining 4 standard makes effort worthwhile. Given the wide differences of aptitude with which we are born and which we do not know</p>
<p>how to alter, is it not good for young children to discover that some</p>
<p>goals are beyond their capacities; that they cannot win all the tests? | .</p>
<p>Is it not better to know one's limitations, as well as one's capacities; not to live in delusions which life sooner or later will rudely shatter?</p>
<p>Every American wants the best for our children. In education the best we can give them is the chance to stretch their minds and reach the</p>
<p>highest goal their intellect can encompass. &quot;Democracy, &quot; wrote the late</p>
<p>Dorothy Thompson, &quot;4s not to be conceived of as an invitation to share</p>
<p>a common mediocrity, but a system that allows each to express and live</p>
<p>up to the special, excellence that is in him.&quot;</p>
<p>Last May, in testimony on English education before the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman Clarence Cannon asked me by what means I thought Congress might help to speed educational progress. I suggested that a National Standards Committee be created. | This would be a&amp; small Committee composed of men of national stature and eminence--trustworthy, intelligent, scholarly and devoted to the ideal of an American education second to none. ‘The Committee would have two tasks:</p>
<p>The first would be purely informational; it would act as an educationa watchtower announcing danger when it Saw it approaching. The members. would keep under continuous scrutiny, and periodically report on the state of American education. Does it meet the needs of our times? Is it competitive with education in countries at similar levels of culture and technology with whom we compete economically, politically, or militarily? How do American children compare in academic knowledge with children: in Europe or Russia, say at age 12, or 16, or 18; taking, of course, into consideration different ability levels? ;</p>
<p>The Committee's Second task would be to formulate a national scholastic standard on the basis of its findings; &amp;@ standard which would make us internationally competitive and would aiso respond to our specific domestic needs. The Committee would do this by means of examinations set at different ability levels. No one would have to take them, but those who</p>
<p>passed would receive national accreditation. The Committee would in no</p>
<p>way interfere with established institutions now granting diplomas or degrees. It would simply set up a higher standard, offer it to anyone</p>
<p>-who wished to meet it, and certify those who had successfully done so.</p>
<p>Neither the Committee's informational nor its standard setting function would represent a radical departure from established practice. Many federal agencies collect and distribute information, We need a disinterested agency to tell us the unvarnished truth about the true state of American education. The Committee would help prevent complacency and illusions of superiority and thus save us from the kind of Painful shocks that Sputnik and other evidence of Russian scientific proficiency have given us in the past few years. There is precedent, too, for the Committee's setting of permissive national standards. We have something very like it in last year’s amendment to the 1956 Water Pollution Act.</p>
<p>This amendment authorizes the federal government--1f so requested by ' &amp; State--to research and develop new methods of pollution control and to award grants-in-aid to localities and states wishing to use these federally established methods. In principle, you have here &amp; national standard very much like the scholastic standard of the proposed Committee, in that it 1s not imposed but merely offered as @ service on a take it</p>
<p>or leave it basis. | |</p>
<p>In both cases, we face a problem that cannot be solved by local and. state authorities alone but requires some assistance from the federal government. Population growth threatens us with @ severe water shortage unless we devise better means to preserve the quality of our water resources so that they may be used over and over again. Pollution abatement has therefore become a national Problem and we accept anew kind of federal aid. I believe improvement of the. quality of American education is at</p>
<p>least as pressing as the need for an assured supply of clean water.</p>
<p>“gaucation, &quot; says the Ford Foundation report for 1959; ™s now the andispensable medium for survival and progress. &quot; Education 4g so basic to the quality of our national life that by steering 4t in the right direction we can change America's future; we can make it secure. To steer it right, I believe we need a new kind of federal aia--the Kind of aid that the | proposed National Standards Committee would offer. oo</p>
<p>Let ‘me make 4t erystal clear that nothing in my proposal would violate che constitutional separation of power petween federal and state government 5 ; nor g0 counter to our tradition of control of schools by</p>
<p>the local community . r envisage the rendering of a service, not regulation</p>
<p>in any way» shape Or manner. The proposed Committee would not usurp</p>
<p>the functions of any existing institution.</p>
<p>Its job would be to draw uP national examinations going deeply into a candidate's true knowledge and sntellectual caliber--not TBM graded multiple choice tests. I suggested to the appropriations Committee</p>
<p>that we might well model them on the English national examinations which come at three levels and which offer many subject tests. Students choose the number of subjects and the level at which they wish to be examined. : is marked on their certificate which will list their so-called &quot;passes.&quot;</p>
<p>; The Committee might provide © one set of examinations at the level appropriate for a high school graduate who aspires to enter @ first-rate college; another set of examinations at the level of students who may wish to prepare for a semiprofessional or technician's job not requiring</p>
<p>pachelor degree put still requiring a good high school education. ‘still</p>
<p>another for gradua ates of various types of colleges; especially those</p>
<p>bound for the teaching profession. I stress again that no one would</p>
<p>meed to take these examinations; but those who did pass them successfully would obtain national certification; perhaps the notation N. g, --National Scholar --stamped on their regular diplomas or degrees. The seal would clearly indicate what the holder had achieved. There are many occasions © when admissions officers of higher educational institutions or prospective employers have &amp; valid reason for wanting to know what an applicant's scholastic qualifications actually are. Think how much time and money would be saved if the diploma were clearly to indicate this!</p>
<p>Everywhere abroad it is taken for granted that academic degrees conform to</p>
<p>specific standard--a standard known to everyone. Setting the standard is</p>
<p>not regarded as government 4ntrusion or tyranny but as a welcome service</p>
<p>to students, their parents and the taxpayers who pay for public education.</p>
<p>Everyone penefits when there is a standard. At one stroke it does away with misleading educational labels 50 that any layman has the means to judge whether @ school or college is doing its job properly. By offering the reward of a certified diploma to our children many who now drift through school would be encouraged to aspire to higher academic goals. |</p>
<p>In his “introduction to the Hearings before the Committee on Appropriations, Chairman Cannon wrote that this &quot;committee hopes the Admiral's remarks will stimulate a national debate on She question of</p>
<p>whether there shall be set up an agency of some kind to provide permissive</p>
<p>national standards by way of national examinations leading to national</p>
<p>acereditation of diplomas and degrees.&quot; Those who are interested in this</p>
<p>&amp; mp</p>
<p>matter may obtain a copy of the Hearings, entitled &quot;Education For All Children: What We Can Learn From England,&quot; by writing to their Congressman or Senator or to Congressman Clarence Cannon, Chairman, House</p>
