      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This May 18, 1962, hearing features Admiral H.G. Rickover advocating for continued development of the &quot;seed-blanket&quot; reactor concept, emphasizing **conservation of natural resources** over immediate economic competitiveness. He highlights the success of the Shippingport reactor, which derived 53% of its total core energy from a natural uranium blanket that lasted over 27,000 full power hours, significantly reducing reprocessing needs and waste. Rickover proposes a 5-6 year design and development program for a larger 500,000-kilowatt plant, aiming to advance reactor technology applicable to all civilian power reactors, similar to Shippingport&#x27;s pioneering contributions in uranium oxide fuel and reactor components. Initial cost estimates are $95 million for research and development and $100 million for construction. Rickover clarifies that current reactors are &quot;converters&quot; rather than &quot;breeders,&quot; and he maintains a realistic, long-term perspective on atomic power&#x27;s economic viability, stating his primary motivation is prudent use of irreplaceable natural resources, not immediate profitability. The session details his commitment to transparency and the initial $7.5 million appropriation request for this study phase.</p>

<p>The subcommittee met, pursuant to recess, at 2 p.m. in room AE-1,<br>the Capitol, Hon. John O. Pastore (chairman of the subcommittee)</p>
<p>residing;</p>
<p>P Present: Senators Pastore, Anderson, Aiken, and Dworshak, Rep-<br>resentatives Holifield and Hosmer.</p>
<p>Also present: Janes T. Ramey, executive director; David R. Toll,<br>committee counsel; Edward J. Bauser, technical adviser; Kenneth<br>McAlpine and Jack R. Newman, professional staff members; and<br>Raymond J. Poskaitis, General Accounting Office consultant.</p>
<p>WITNESSES</p>
<p>Vice Adm. H. G. Rickover, Manager, Naval Reactors, Division<br>of Reactor Development; and I. H. Mandel, Chief, Reactor Engineer-<br>ing Branch, Naval Reactors, Division of Reactor Development,<br>Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. The Subcommittee on Legislation of the Joint<br>Committee on Atomic Energy is continuing public hearings on H.R.<br>11733 and S. 3292, bills to authorize appropriations for the Atomic<br>Energy Commission for fiscal year 1963. :</p>
<p>Today our first. witness will be Adm. H. G. Rickover, Chief of the<br>Naval Reactors Branch of the AEC. On Wednesday AEC Chair-<br>man Seaborg testified that the Commission’s uppropriations request<br>for fiscal year 1968 includes $7,500,000 for research and development<br>work to be performed in fiscal years 1963 and 1964, together with<br>appropriate engineering and design effort, sufficient to determine the<br>potential of a 500-electrical megawatt central station seed-blanket<br>plant and to make a decision on construction of such a plant. We<br>have asked Admiral Rickover to furnish the subcommittee additional<br>information concerning the seed-blanket concept, and to make such<br>other comments as he may desire concerning the atomic power<br>program.</p>
<p>After completion of Admiral Rickover’s testimony, the subcom-<br>mittee wit resume consideration of the bill, commencing with proj-<br>ect 63-k-1,</p>
<p>_ We are very pleased to have you with us this afternoon, Admiral<br>Rickover. Please proceed.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>292 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Srrep-BLANKET CoNCEPT</p>
<p>Admiral .Rickover. I do appreciate very much being here, sir, and<br>having the opportunity: to tal<br>atomic powerplant design based on the seed-blanket concept.</p>
<p>May I have your permission, sir, to tell you why we chose the partic-<br>ular design of the Shippingport reactor which utilizes the seed-<br>blanket concept and which is a different one than other reactor design-<br>ers have chosen. I believe it would be of interest to your committee to<br>get a brief résumé of the reasons leading to this approach. _ &#x27;</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. You may proceed in any way you wish, Admiral.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It seemed to me in 1954, at the time we started<br>considering civilian atomic power that it would be purposeless to<br>proceed on such a venture unless it would result in a conservation of<br>our natural resources; that is we should design a reasonable size plant<br>that would produce as much energy as possible from natural uranium.<br>Because whenever you are forced to use enriched uranium, whether<br>it be 2 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent or 93 percent, enriched, you are<br>actually using substantial amounts of coal indirectly since it takes<br>considerable quantities of electrical power to make the enriched<br>uranium.</p>
<p>Obviously if atomic power is to replace coal, there is little point in —</p>
<p>using coal to make enriched uranium and then using this uranium to<br>generate atomic power ; this would be self-defeating.<br>So it was from the standpoint of conserving our natural resources</p>
<p>that we chose to develop the seed-blanket concept. This system uses —<br>a minimum of enriched U 235—for example, in the Shippingport ~</p>
<p>reactor there are about 90 kilograms of U 235—and a blanket of 14<br>tons of natural uranium. The idea is to keep the natura] uranium</p>
<p>in place as long as possible and to get all of the energy you can out 3</p>
<p>of it. This energy comes from the seventh-tenths of 1 percent ©:</p>
<p>U 235 which is inherent in the natural uranium; from the fast fission- —<br>ing of U 238; and from the plutonium which is formed in the natural —</p>
<p>uranium in the reactor.</p>
<p>What we hoped for has happened. We expect, at the end of the ;</p>
<p>lifetime of the present natural uranium blanket in the Shippingport<br>reactor, to have obtained about 53 percent of the total energy pro-</p>
<p>duced by the core from the natural uranium. The significance of this —<br>is that you take natural uranium, you keep it in place in the reactor —<br>possible with —<br>the result that there is little need to chemically reprocess it when you —</p>
<p>for several years, you burn it up to the maximum extent<br>remove it from the reactor.</p>
<p>POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES OF SEED-BLANKET CORE</p>
<p>When the entire core utilizes slightly enriched uranium as a num- —<br>ber of reactors do, this slightly enriched fuel must. be chemically re- —<br>pie formed. That introduces two”</p>
<p>chemical reprocessing itself with the at-—<br>tendant radioactive wastes which are inherent and whose disposition”<br>or storage may ultimately come to be a very large part of the cost of<br>atomic power. This is a problem that has not yet been faced up to<br>We do have estimated costs for chemical reprocessing but we don’t</p>
<p>processed to remove the<br>problems: one, the cost o</p>
<p>about the proposed 500,000-kilowatt - 3</p>
<p>APC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 293</p>
<p>know how correct they are. The balances are, as is true of everything<br>q else in atomic energy and in other new technical concepts, that it will<br>be considerably greater than the figures originally mentioned. This<br>has been true of everything whether it is atomic power, airplanes, air-<br>eraft carriers, submarines, tanks, missiles, or anything else.</p>
<p>The problem of what. to do with the radioactive wastes must, be<br>considered in terms of its long-range effects—that is to say the effects<br>that may occur hundreds of years, perhaps thousands of years from<br>now, because some of these radioactive wastes have very long half-<br>lives and we cannot sit here and feel we have no responsibility for<br>future generations. Certainly we do have a responsibility to our<br>resent citizens; we have also a responsibility to our future citizens.</p>
<p>us an important advantage of seed-blanket cores is that they re-</p>
<p>uire less chemical reprocessing than slightly enriched cores.</p>
<p>- Another advantage of a seed-blanket core is that the natural urani-<br>um blanket lasts a long time, with a consequent reduction in fabrica-<br>tion costs which constitute a considerable part of reactor fuel costs.</p>
<p>At Shippingport the original design contemplated we would get<br>a life of about 8,000 full power hours out of the blanket. Actually, by<br>the time we deplete the fourth seed. we will have obtained over 27,000<br>full power hours out of the blanket. This corresponds to ana verage<br>burnup of 9,000 and a maximum burnup of 36,000 megawatt-days<br>per ton of the natural uranium oxide. ; .<br>It is these most encouraging results that have led us to consider a<br>much larger atomic powerplant utilizing the seed-blanket concept.</p>
<p>The pe uepert plant is presently rated at 60,000 electrical kilo-<br>tts. At the time we began designing it in 1954 its size was deter-</p>
<p>ned by the largest pressure vessel we would get from American in-<br>ry. As the committee knows, we are currently designing a new<br>acement core for the Shippingport reactor which will have a ca-<br>ty of 150,000 electrical kilowatts instead of the ori ginal 60,000 kilo-<br>ts. This core is expected to generate 514 times as much energy<br>€ first core was designed to produce.<br>lere Is one bit of philosophy I believe worth mentioning about<br>rtaking any sort of design. For example, Mr. Chairman, if you<br>say to me “I would like you to build a large reactor of about<br>aa to 500,000 kilowatts, could you do it,” I would answer “Yes.<br>1 the knowledge and experience I now have I could design and<br>it. But I see no purpose at the present stage of development of<br>power merely to build reactors for the sake of building them.”<br>country has plenty of coal right now and the development of<br>1¢ energy has not reached the stage where, with the exception of<br>: we . Ioan agi design and build reactors, in my opinion,<br>7. Fe, 1f you ordered me to do so I could build a large reactor<br>Be nowledge we have learned at Shippingport and this new<br>ve work. Nevertheless I think that would be foolhardy,<br>a ae Stage of the atomic energy program we should build</p>
<p>Aon r ay only if they advance reactor technology.<br>the ot and, if you were to tell me “We would like you to un-<br>ears Aaada and evelopment of a reactor to be completed about<br>now and which will incorporate many new advances,”</p>
<p>294 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>then I would put a group of my people on the job. By the fact<br>that we would have a considerable number of experienced people<br>working on the. design—people knoweldgeable in atomic power<br>they would soon start coming up with ideas, and«you would find, as<br>has invariably been the case, these new ideas would throw out many<br>of the present ones. Consequently, by taking several years to develop<br>a new plant incorporating new and advanced technology, you would<br>end up with a much better plant than if you had merely proceeded<br>to build the plant based on the then existing technology.</p>
<p>This is what always comes out of development. The chances are, if<br>we are permitted to go ahead with this program and you give us our<br>head, the result that will come out of the development 5 years from<br>now will be completely different than anything I, or your committee,<br>or the Atomic Energy Commission or the people in the laboratories<br>presently envision. It would be my objective to turn our talents to<br>the project and give you a reactor plant 5 years from now which will<br>be just as much in the lead in atomic energy as the Shippingport re-<br>actor was when it started operating. Otherwise, I would not at all<br>care to become involved in a project whose objective was merely to<br>build a reactor. I have no desire to devote my time, the time of my<br>engineers, or the time of the scientists and engineers in the laboratories<br>to a project of building a reactor just for the sake of building one.<br>We have too many important things to do.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. To complete this development you speak of, you<br>would have to build the reactor itself eventually—not for the sake of<br>the building, but because you could not learn the lessons unless it were<br>actually built and operated.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir. However, I would not<br>want to commit myself to building the reactor this year or next year<br>or even the year after. I would want to devote about 5 years to the<br>design and development. There probably would be a time, say 3 years<br>from now, 3 years after I started where I could come to this committee<br>and say “I now see my way clear to go in a certain promising direction,<br>and it is wise to start construction”—but even after we started con-<br>struction, we would still introduce new ideas as we went along.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. In other words, you would not be going blind.<br>You would want to know certain things that were fundamental before<br>you started.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think you have highlighted the issue very<br>well, sir. I am merely discussing whether we should start. building a<br>reactor immediately or wait 3 years. I can build youone now. Ican<br>build you a reactor just as well as any one else. I have just as good<br>talent in my headquarters organization and in my laboratories as any<br>place in this country. It would be foolhardy to start building the re-<br>actor plant at once for the reasons I have given. I would not want<br>to undertake such a project. In my opinion, it would be a waste of<br>Government funds.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. As you say, you went along in a couple of<br>years and you came up with some problem that was very sticky. I<br>would like to know your approach. Do you spend any amount of<br>money to overcome that problem, or would you say:</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It would depend on the problem and the ad-<br>vantages that would accrue from solving it.</p>
<p>ABC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 295</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am not too certain that we are justified in<br>throwing a lot of money into solving some problem when possibly it<br>might be much better spent on some other approach. .</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovsr. Certainly if the committee has some other pro)-<br>ect they think had better be done rather than this, I think you should<br>do Representative Hosmer. I am talking about the moment 2 years<br>from now when you run into a sticky problem that is going to take<br>$20 million to solve and it will not necessarily at that point be a com-<br>mittee decision. It will be more yours, I imagine. Would you be</p>
<p>illing at that point to give up the project ?</p>
<p>i ira RreKovER, ‘Yes, sir, i have done this in the past, Mr.<br>Hosmer. I have so far produced the only viable sodium cooled atomic<br>powerplant in the world. It worked successfully for 2 years and I<br>personally terminated the project after it had worked well for 2 years.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will I use my energies or those of my people<br>on any work I do not consider worthwhile. _ ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are not going to parallel this pro-</p>
<p>gram, the seed blanket, with something else, are you?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I am talking of a seed-blanket con-<br>cept. Unquestionably we will run into difficulties but the only time<br>you make progress in any field whether it is atomic power or anything<br>else, is when you run into difficulties and solve them, and don’t run<br>away from them. That is the only way you can learn.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. The point I am making is I hope you<br>would not be Quixotic about it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. To answer your question, I think I can point<br>to my record. I have 43 nuclear power reactors operating right now<br>which is more than twice as many as all of the other operational power<br>reactors in the world. I do not believe anyone on the committee can<br>say I have ever continued with a program that was no good. I would<br>not do so, even if you urged me to. I would not even do it for you,<br>Mr. Hosmer.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL ADVANTAGES OF SHIPPINGPORT REACTOR</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrrep. Admiral Rickover, I think it would be well<br>to establish for the record at this point the importance from a techno-<br>logical standpoint of the existing Shippingport reactor. Would you<br>give us, in your opinion, an analysis of the contribution which the<br>Shippingport reactor has made, from a technical sense, to the reactor<br>art ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The greatest fiatiory given me so far is that<br>practically everybody both here and abroad has copied the technology<br>of the Shippingport reactor. For example, the fuel being used in<br>practically all large civilian water-cooled reactors is uranium oxide.<br>The development and largescale manufacture of uranium oxide was<br>pioneered in the Shippingport reactor and this has been a most sig-<br>nificant contribution to the reactor art. About 2 years ago this same<br>question was asked of me in this committee, and [ submitted for the<br>record a large number of contributions the Shippingport reactor had<br>made. They include developments in nuclear physics, heat transfer,<br>metallurgy, hydraulics, reactor control, large reactor vessels and their</p>
<p>296 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>closures, large canned rotor pumps, refueling, and so forth. When we<br>started up the Shippingport reactor, we found that as a result of our<br>extensive development and test work practically everything came<br>within a few percent of what we had predicted. , ‘</p>
<p>I am not saying that because this is anything to brag about, but<br>because when you have done experiments, when you have conducted<br>developments and the finished product turns out in accordance with<br>what you predicted, then you are in a position to measure and learn<br>from what you have done. &#x27;</p>
<p>_I believe it is of interest. to note that at the time we started the Ship-<br>pingport reactor the technical and scientific community considered<br>that water technology was not. the route to follow for civilian reac-<br>tors. The General Advisory Committee also considered that water<br>reactors should not be pursued. I believe the General Advisory Com-<br>mittee has made other errors once or twice; they certainly did make<br>an error in this case. Now, there is general agreement that the water-<br>cooled reactor route is a promising approach if not the most<br>promising.</p>
<p>Chairman Hottrretp. Would it be a fair statement. for me to say<br>that the basic technology of atomic reactors stems principally from<br>the development work, the experimental work and the operational<br>procedure of the Shippingport reactor ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; I think that is a fair statement, and<br>I believe you will find that people like Mr. William Webster, who<br>is operating the Yankee atomic powerplant in New England, will<br>confirm this—I believe he has already told this to your committee.<br>I believe you will find other knowledgeable people who will say the<br>same. I think any group responsible for a development such as Ship-<br>pingport would be accorded this sort of statement.</p>
<p>My purpose in undertaking the development of a large 500,000-<br>kilowatt power reactor is to create a similar situation, to achieve major<br>advances in the reactor art.</p>
<p>PURPOSE IN FURTHER WORK ON SEED-BLANKET CORE</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irme p. In other words, you are thinking about a<br>laboratory type of reactor, the purpose of which will be similar to<br>that of the Shippingport in the development of advanced stages of<br>technology which will not only be applicable to the seed-in-blanket<br>concept which you propose but will be of value to all of the different<br>types of reactor art.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir. It. would be a large-scale<br>development facility with emphasis being plated on learning; learn-<br>ing all sorts of lessons which would be applicable to all types of civil-<br>ian power reactors.</p>
<p>For example, the Shippingport reactor has several hundred instru-<br>ments inside the core, so we can tell at all times what is going on.<br>A great, deal of expensive and painstaking development work had to<br>be carried out to develop these instruments. From my standpoint,<br>without such core and plant instrumentation there would be no point<br>in building a reactor, since I would not be developing or proving out<br>advanced technology—technology which will benefit the entire reactor</p>
<p>art.</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 297</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irretp. What you are telling this committee at this<br>time is that you want the opportunity to start with the knowledge that<br>you now have a completely advanced new type—not a new type but a<br>completely .advaneed stage of the seed-in-blanket principle in a<br>larger—in what would eventually be a large type reactor, and larger<br>size reactor, but which would be basically as important to the art of<br>the future as the Shippingport has been in the past.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right, sir, and I will repeat what I said<br>previously. If your committee ordered me to build a 500,000-kilowatt<br>reactor based on what I now know, I would not do it except under<br>duress. I would not think it worth the doing.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirieip. We are not asking you to do it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovrr. I know, I am posing a hypothetical situation,</p>
<p>sir.<br>Chairman Hortrretp. We want to clear for the record that what you<br>are asking for is a program of research and development along a cer-<br>tain line based on proven principles. And you are also assuring this<br>committee that in your good judgment you would bring to this art<br>benefits commensurate with the benefits that have been brought in<br>the past by the original Shippingport reactor.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right, sir. We would expect to under-<br>take full- and large-scale developments in all phases of reactor tech-<br>nology including physics, heat transfer, hydraulics, mechanical design,<br>and so forth in order to obtain as much energy as possible from a given<br>volume of natural uranium. We would investigate many concepts,<br>and at a certain time there would have to be a cutoff because as is<br>always true in development, the further you go along the more you<br>wish you could go on; but unless you terminate development and start<br>building you get nowhere.</p>
<p>Chairman Hotirieip. You are further stating if at any time along<br>the route whether it be at the end of one year or the second or third<br>year, if you come to the conclusion that you have embarked upon an<br>unprofitable venture, you will come to this committee and say so.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrrerp. And if you run into difficulties which you<br>think can be solved with a reasonable amount of support that you<br>will then solve those difficulties.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; and in giving you this assurance I<br>respectfully ask that you remember I have for many years always<br>operated with your committee in this way.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Admiral, at this very point, based upon the wise<br>experience you have had with reactors, particularly with the Ship-<br>pingport reactors, where the costs are very high, do you presently<br>have confidence that if you do embark upon this venture you might<br>or have the hope that you will achieve competitive power ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. Ido not.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Then this is strictly a gamble at any rate.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think I have just as much chance of achieving<br>truly competitive power as any one else, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Then why are we doing it ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Because atomic power has not yet reached the<br>Stage, in my opinion, where it is competitive; but if you don’t proceed<br>with its development you never will get competitive atomic power.</p>
<p>836276220</p>
<p>298 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Don’t you think we ought to have some preconfi-<br>dence that after all we may achieve our goal? I realize we can’t<br>forecast to the accuracy of the future but on the other hand we must<br>have a goal in mind before we embark even on*these experiments.<br>What are we trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I can only tell you this: I believe I can get<br>economic atomic power just as fast and as well as any one else. How-<br>ever, I have doubts that some of the promises being made will be<br>fulfilled.</p>
<p>Tama student of history. It has been said that a page of history is<br>worth more than a book of logic or argument. I go back to history<br>and read all of the promises for economic atomic power made to your<br>committee during the last 10 years. Almost everyone who has ever<br>come to this committee to sell a reactor idea has sold it on the basis it<br>would be competitive when it was finished. No reactor has yet been<br>competitive.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. When I had a private talk with Billy Webster,<br>whom you mentioned, he said to me in very optimistic fashion in a<br>short period of time, he gaged it between 10 and 15 years, with his re-<br>actor, which is a refinement of the Shippingport reactor, as you al-<br>ready pointed out, that he would achieve competitive power.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If Mr. Webster can achieve it, then I can too<br>because his estimates are based on the technology I developed at Ship-<br>pingport.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. But as you sit there you don’t think you have the<br>confidence that that isso. I don’t care about measuring—I don’t want<br>an argument on this. I am just trying to find out. This would be<br>putting money in an experiment here where the people who are going<br>to utilize this money don’t presently have the confidence that they will<br>achieve the goal.</p>
<p>I don’t say you have to prove it or give us a guarantee but we have<br>to have the confidence at this moment.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. This is like 39 articles to which everyone had<br>to subscribe before he could enter Oxford. They would not let anyone<br>in until he subscribed to them. Then one day a wise student came<br>along and said “I will subscribe to 89 articles as long as you let me in.”</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. I don’t think you would say that. I have a great:<br>deal of confidence in you and you are a competent individual. I am<br>not debating this subject, but I asked you a question once before, what<br>was the incentive for Government money being invested in an enter-</p>
<p>rise that we considered to be a free enterprise that belongs to private<br>industry in this country, and you very ably said that some day our<br>fossil fuel resources are going to run out and we have to think of an<br>alternative method of producing electric power if we are going to<br>maintain out economic standard in the world.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Let me put it another way, Senator Pastore.<br>The cost of electric power is about 1 percent of the total cost. of pro-<br>duction of a finished product. Suppose it went up to 2 percent or 3<br>percent. Would we stop using electricity because it is 2 or 3 percent ?<br>Supposing the sewage system for your heuse cost 1 percent. Sup-<br>posing the sewage system costs were doubled, would you stop using it ?</p>
<p>No. I think you are being subjected to a distorted viewpoint when</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 299</p>
<p>you hear all of these arguments for economic atomic power and which<br>have been figured so carefully that they are predicting the cost to a<br>hundredth of a mill. The objective in developing atomic power is to<br>develop an alternative source of energy for our fossil fuel resources<br>which must eventually run out.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Regardless of cost?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Regardless of cost, because no modern indus-<br>trial society is viable without large-scale energy resources. That is<br>the basic reason for continuing the development of atomic power.<br>When people talk about competitive nuclear power costs, they take<br>into account Government subsidies, low interest charges, low chemical<br>reprocessing costs, and so forth, which make it very difficult to deter-<br>mine the real cost of atomic power. But when the time comes when<br>you do have any more electricity in your house, Mrs. Pastore will<br>raise the devil with you. She will say, “I don’t care about the cost.<br>I want my electric lights.”</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Not with me, with the electricity charges.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. She will raise the devil with you if you say<br>she can’t have electricity because the costs are higher than they used<br>to be.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. In other words, our incentive at the moment must<br>be to protect our natural resources that one day might run out and<br>that this is an experiment that has to be undertaken regardless of<br>what the cost might be in the hope that we might achieve competi-<br>tiveness.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Senator Pastore, from a purely logical stand-<br>point, we should never use coal or oil because they were created by<br>solar energy 500 million years ago. The oil we use each year took<br>nature 14 million years to create. You need only be a grammar<br>school graduate and start doing a little computation to learn that no<br>matter how much more oil we may find we must eventually run out<br>because the rate of creation of new fossil fuels is so slight. So no<br>matter how large the bank account is, it can’t keep up with the rate<br>at which we are spending. On this basis, we should restrict the use<br>of coal and oil for energy purposes, because it is very wasteful of our<br>natural resources. We should use oil and coal for many other more<br>important things.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. In view of the statement you have just made,<br>do you think that our overall policy implemented by the appropria-<br>tions and the programs that we have instituted thus far that we have<br>lagged.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I don’t think you have lagged in the money you<br>have appropriated. I believe you are the most generous body on<br>earth in that respect. I believe this Congress is the most generous<br>Congress that has existed in all history.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You will subscribe to anything.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Do you feel there has been any slowness on the<br>part of the administrative bodies of the Government in programing<br>this project?<br>_ Admiral Ricxover. I don’t think that this committee has been<br>laggard or backward in urging or in helping the development of<br>atomic power. This certainly has not. been my experience.</p>
<p>300 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. The committee has always gone a step further<br>than the administrative bodies but what I am trying to determine at<br>this time, do you think we are going along fast enough to meet the<br>urgency of which you speak for future generations ? 4</p>
<p>Admiral Rrexover. I think you are going along fast enough as<br>measured by the dollars you appropriate. I think that with the money<br>being spent in this country today for development of atomic power,<br>you should get adequate results. When you will obtain these ade-<br>quate results, I don’t know. But I suggest you not be taken in by<br>the economic aspects which are always being quoted to you. As I<br>have said, a page of history is worth more than a year of argument.<br>I think the committee might study a little bit more of the history<br>of the atomic program and the promises that have been made to you<br>over all these years, and not pay quite as much attention to the immedi-<br>ate and transitory arguments that are made to you on economic<br>grounds.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Are you disappointed in any way in the progress<br>that. we have already achieved in this field ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would rather not answer that question be-<br>cause I am disappointed in my own progress; I have enough problems<br>of my own, and I cannot take on the woes of other people. I consider<br>I have not made half the progress I should. I would have made even<br>less had I not had the support of this committee.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Then is it lack of manpower or money ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; it is not lack of manpower and it is not<br>lack of money. It is mostly that the Government is not geared up to<br>handle modern science and technology. There are too many people in<br>government today handling jobs for which they are not adequate.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Well, on that note, I will yield to my colleagues.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrrerp. Admiral Rickover, I want to see if I can<br>make an attempt at clarifying what I think the record may convey<br>which I don’t believe it is intended to convey. Your testimony has<br>been that while you will not assure this committee that you can<br>achieve economic power, you believe that with the technology at your<br>command and experience and your assistance and your staff and so<br>forth, that you can come as near to it as any one else.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; I do.</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrm tp. May I ask you this question: Are you con-<br>fident that the type of a reactor which you are working on will, in the<br>end, give you, considering all subsidies and everything else, and I am<br>not talking about fake bookkeeping and there is plenty of it in this<br>field, and our committee is making a study now to find out where the<br>subsidies are and how much they are, and this has never been really<br>crystalized, but. we are going to do our best to do it although I recog-<br>nize the fact that this may be most difficult to do. But considering the<br>hidden subsidies that are involved in other types of reactors as well<br>as in your own, do you believe that your type of advocacy will bring</p>
<p>us to the field of economic power as efficiently as other types which are</p>
<p>advocated ?</p>
<p>I will use any of the boiling water, the fast breeder, the sodium-<br>graphite type, the gas cooled, any of these types now. I recognize in<br>asking you this question that I am probably giving you an opportunity</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 301</p>
<p>to present your arguments for your case, but we have heard the argu-<br>ments from others that their type of reactor is superior, and I think<br>we have a right to hear your arguments on the subject and we will be<br>the judge as to who makes the best argument.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I will not say any reactor I propose to under-<br>take will be superior to anyone else’s. I will only tell you that I will<br>see to it that any reactor I am responsible for designing will have as<br>a main objective the conservation of natural resources. That is my<br>measure of economy, and not a promise that it will be one one-hun-<br>dredth of a mill or so cheaper than another reactor. Suppose I and<br>another man go to a shoemaker and each of us says to him: Make me<br>a pair of shoes. But let us also suppose the shoemaker has an uncle<br>who pays some of his expenses. Naturally he can afford to make the<br>shoes cheaper for the other man than for me.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrtevp. I am taking into consideration uncle’s help,<br>and I am talking about Uncle Sam now.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. The only true measure of economy is to deter-<br>mine if we are being prudent with the bank account of natural re-<br>sources that we have and must preserve for future generations, and<br>to decide whether these resources are being used in the most economic<br>manner. On that basis, I can answer that my reactor will be at least<br>as economic as any other. But I do not guarantee that it will be just<br>as “economic” as another if you want to get down to hundredths of a<br>mill. The answer you get that way all depends on what system of<br>arithmetic you use, and whether you are keeping one set. of books<br>or two sets of books. I am not competent to compete in that sort of<br>contest.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irm.p. This committee has been skeptical and his-<br>tory will bear our skepticism was justified in many of the claims made<br>before this committee, and I for one appreciate the fact that you are<br>sone enough to say what you think on this point and let the record<br>stand.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Holifield, it would be very easy for me with<br>the opening you have given me to make promises that might sound<br>pleasing. I could very easily make such promises, but I will not be-<br>cause I value the respect and confidence this committee has always<br>accorded me. I give you equal respect by not telling you something<br>I do not fully believe. I would rather give up this project altogether<br>than do a thing like that. I have dealt with your committee for a<br>good many years, and I am sure that at no time have you ever found<br>a case where I ever gilded the lily or said any optimistic thing—in<br>fact, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral Rickover, I would like to get into<br>some other areas we have not discussed yet. You pick a 500,000-kilo-<br>watt plant. Why do you pick that size?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I selected that size because I conceive that the<br>true function of atomic power is to constitute a series of large load<br>centers throughout the United States. I do not think small atomic<br>powerplants can ever use natural resources economically. Again I<br>am not talking about money. I am talking about using up our bank<br>account of irreplaceable natural resources,</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. This is an experiment rather than a pro-<br>duction reactor as I understood your testimony.</p>
<p>302 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It will only be experimental to the extent that<br>it will be designed with the latest technology and will be heavily in-<br>strumented. That is what I mean by experimental. On this basis, if<br>you want to, you can call the Shippingport reactar experimental; yet<br>the Shippingport reactor has run continuously longer than any other<br>reactor has ever run.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What you stated are the anticipated ben-<br>efits of this project as such things as new knowledge in heat transfer<br>and flow and flux distribution. You stopped there.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I could list many other technical advances we<br>would hope to achieve.</p>
<p>_tbpresentative Hosmer. Those are technical rather than opera-<br>tional.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. From an operational standpoint Duquesne<br>Light, which operates the Shippingport plant, states this plant is<br>easier to operate than any other plant they have. There is no question<br>that the large plant we are considering would be a fully operational<br>plant generating power for civilian use. It would be different only<br>in the sense that it would incorporate all the latest ideas we had<br>developed and be heavily instrumented so we could learn from it as<br>we are currently learning from Shippingport.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but I still get back to<br>the question of 500,000 kilowatts, and why is it necessary for 500,000<br>kilowatts to get these technical advancements you are speaking of?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Hosmer, as I indicated before, it is my<br>opinion, and I think this is generally true of the whole atomic energy<br>industry, the problems connected with the development and design<br>of large atomic power stations are different than those for small size<br>stations.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I know you want large stations, but that is</p>
<p>another question and then we get ourselves into the middle of the<br>argument of public versus private power, and so on.<br>_ Admiral Ricxover. The question of whether it is private or public<br>is not my field. I personally think the Shippingport formula is a<br>good one for an experimental reactor the Government builds and a<br>private utility operates.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you have any thoughts on what you<br>do with this 500,000-kilowatt: power ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Where it would be located ?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; that is not my job. I think that is<br>something your committee would decide.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. It is going to be located in a TVA system<br>that might be one element of congressional consideration. If it were<br>located some places, there might be another.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. You appreciate that this is an area I am not.<br>competent to comment upon, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Let’s get back to the technical arguments,<br>and let me ask you if you couldn&#x27;t substantially make these technical<br>advancements with a plant of smaller size.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; the design and operational problems<br>that have to be solved for plants of large physical size and power</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 303</p>
<p>rating are quite different than for smaller size plants. We have seen<br>this often for example in the different designs we have had to date<br>even for our naval reactors. The minute you make a change in size<br>you run into all sort of new problems. This was again demonstrated<br>at Shippingport in practically all phases of the design, development,<br>and fabrication of the second core. Here the power rating was in-<br>creased from the 60,000 electrical kilowatts of the first core to 150,000<br>kilowatts.</p>
<p>If there are to be large atomic powerplants, and a lot of people<br>believe that they are definitely required, then you must go ahead and<br>develop, design, and build such large plants. That is the only way<br>we will learn.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED COST OF SEED-BLANKET REACTOR</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What is your idea of the possible total cost<br>of this project ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I think the research and development would<br>probably total about $95 million and it would probably cost about<br>$100 million to build the entire plant. I believe a repeat plant would<br>cost about $90 million. These are very rough figures.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. A what ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. By repeat plant, I mean a duplicate plant of<br>the first one, and thus its cost would be somewhat less.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then the thing would have to be operated<br>for some period of time.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Several years; yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. How many years would you say?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would hope that with the kind of core we<br>expect to develop, the natural uranium blanket would last for many<br>years—5 to 10 years. And it would only be necessary to renew the seeds<br>during this period. Right now at Shippingport after more than 4<br>years of operation, the original blanket of natural uranium is still in<br>place operating with its third seed. If it were not for the need to test<br>out the second and more advanced core which has a rating of 150,000<br>kilowatts as compared to 60,000 kilowatts of the first core, we could<br>have run this original charge of natural uranium with several more<br>seeds. This is the advantage of the seed-blanket concept—-it provides<br>a core where the natural uranium fuel is capable of lasting for many<br>years and thus produce a large amount of energy per unit volume—<br>on the average well over 20,000 MW D-ton.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you have an estimate of how much a<br>year it would cost the Government net to operate this plant?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I do not; any determination of net operating<br>costs would have to take into consideration the money that is paid<br>back by the utility company for the steam they receive from the<br>reactor—such as at Shippingport for example.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But the money you are getting back cer-<br>tainly isnot covering all the costs that go into it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It isn’t, because at Shippingport, apart from<br>operating the reactor we also carry out extensive tests and experiments<br>to develop and further reactor technology. As you well know, Mr.</p>
<p>304 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Hosmer, much of our present knowledge and understanding of water<br>reactors has come from this project, and continues to come from it.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You have roughly a plant that is five times<br>or more the potential of Shippingport ‘ &#x27;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. A 500-megawatt electrical plant would have<br>about 314 times the capacity we expect to have at Shippingport when<br>we install the second core.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. We have $200 million invested in this<br>thing in R. &amp; D. and construction and we have to operate it for 10<br>years. I am trying to get a final figure of what we pay for what we<br>finally get out of it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. At this early stage of the project, I don’t be-<br>lieve any figures would be too meaningful</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. It costs $10 million a year.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I don’t think it would cost that much at all.<br>I believe the current cost to the Government for operating Shipping-<br>port has averaged about $2 million over the past 3 years. However,<br>when allowance is made for the payments received from the utility<br>for the steam they use to generate electricity, the net annual cost to<br>the Government during these 3 years has averaged about $100,000.<br>The cost: of operating a reactor plant is not necessarily a function of<br>its size. It is much more a function of the experiments, tests, and<br>analysis you perform to determine the potential of the plant and<br>how it can be further improved.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but at the same time I<br>know as thoughtful as you are in these maters you must anticipate<br>that after you get it constructed there is going to be some kind—<br>have some idea of the order of magnitude of the experimental costs.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If I could answer these questions it would no<br>longer be a development. As I stated before, at the present stage of<br>this project, any figures would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I think we are entitled to have some idea<br>whether it is going to be a quarter of a billion or half a billion dol-</p>
<p>lars that the Government puts into this.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I have given you an estimate of the amount I<br>believe will be required for the research and development. I also<br>~~ given you an estimate for the cost of construction of such a<br>plant.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That brings it up to about $200 million<br>so you are getting close to a quarter of a billion.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is right.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then we have 10 years operating the<br>plant that. costs us $400,000 per installed kilowatt.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. As I mentioned earlier, if the Shippingport-<br>type formula were to be used, the utility operating the plant would<br>pay the Government for the steam they were using to generate elec-<br>tricity.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are some time going to be selling<br>your kilowatts at less than it costs you to produce.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Probably so, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. So you are going to have a net operating<br>cost over this period of time.</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 305</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I think this estimate applies to anyone op-<br>erating a reactor today. . .</p>
<p>Represantative cea. Do you think it would be possible at all<br>to furnish us an estimate on that? ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover: Mr. Hosmer, the plant we are talking about.<br>has not yet been developed. I don’t even know yet what it will look<br>like. Any estimates I might make would have little substance. a<br>like stating that when parents get together and decide to have a child,<br>they ought to know what year he is going tobe President. ‘at?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I don’t think that is quite fair in relation<br>to a matter of extrapolating costs out. If you took the cost of Ship-<br>pingport and multiplied it by 5—— ; ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It does not work that way, sir. The operating<br>cost of a reactor plant is not a direct function of its size—and with<br>regard to performing tests and experiments, you would not require<br>more technical people just because the plant 1s five times larger in<br>output. You generally have about the same number—it does not<br>take significantly more people to operate and test a large plant than<br>it does a small one.</p>
<p>PRODUCTION OF PLUTONIUM NET IN SEED-BLANKET CORE</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. In the operation of this plant what do<br>you estimate the production of fissionable atoms for fissionable atoms<br>used ? . . * - .</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. To give you an idea of this, I might mention<br>our experience at Shippingport. We expect by the end of the fourth<br>seed to have generated over 53 percent of the total core energy from<br>the natural uranium blanket which has been in the reactor since its<br>original startup over 4 years ago. A major portion of this enbtey<br>comes from the fission of plutonium which has been formed in the<br>natural uranium. ; . .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That is not the same thing. That is not<br>the question I am asking. I am asking what the regeneration ratio is.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I believe that it is on the order of 80 percent<br>as it is in most thermal reactors. The exact number would depend<br>on the design and this of course is one area among many others that<br>we would be investigating in the project I am proposing.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are burning more than you are pro-<br>ducing by way of fissionable materials. —</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. This is correct at Shippingport and for that<br>matter in all operating reactors today. .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Of that that you are producing, you are<br>burning 53? ——</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. At Shippingport, about 53 percent of the total<br>energy produced in the reactor is generated by the natural uranium<br>blanket. This energy comes largely from the fission of plutonium<br>that is formed in the blanket. There is no operating reactor In the<br>world today that is not burning more fissionable atoms than it pro-<br>duces. ; ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but you said there is an<br>80 percent regeneration ratio.</p>
<p>306 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I was referring to the ratio of the total atoms<br>of fissionable material produced to the total atoms of U-235 fissioned.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Of the fissionable atoms you produce, then<br>I take it you burn 53 percent ? ‘ ,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. The 53 percent&#x27;refers to the fraction<br>of total core power generated by the natural uranium blanket.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You tell me you are getting 53 percent of<br>your power out of your blanket.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is correct; 47 percent of the total core<br>energy is produced by the seeds. The remaining 53 percent is pro-<br>duced by the natural uranium blanket, a major portion of which is<br>generated by the fissioning of the plutonium formed in the natural<br>uranium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That is what I was getting at. But when<br>you produce plutonium, you are burning your uranium to do it.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. And for every uranium atom you burn you<br>make eight-tenths of a plutonium atom?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. This figure is of the correct order and is gen-<br>erally true of all thermal reactors.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are getting 53 percent of your power<br>and you must be burning about 53 percent of them.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Fifty-three percent of the total core power is<br>generated by the natural uranium blanket and a high fraction of this<br>1s produced from the fissioning of plutonium formed in the natural<br>uranium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then do you plan to recycle the blanket?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Not necessarily, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Recover the other?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Whether the blanket is reprocessed or not would<br>depend largely on the cost of reprocessing and the value of plutonium.<br>One of the important features of the seed-blanket core is to obtain<br>as much energy as possible out of the natural uranium blanket so that.<br>when you have depleted it, there is little need to reprocess it. because it<br>will then contain but a relatively small amount of plutonium. Most<br>of the plutonium formed was burned in place to generate power. This<br>is why seed-blanket cores are less sensitive than other designs to varia-<br>tions in the cost of processing or the value of plutonium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You said there is 47 percent in your plu-<br>tonium that did not burn.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I stated that 47 percent of the total core energy<br>was generated by the seeds; the remaining 53 percent was produced<br>by the natural uranium blanket.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But you don’t burn all of the plutonium in<br>your blankets?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No, there is always a little left.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you get a burnup rate of 90 percent?<br>You don’t get that high, do you?</p>
<p>Mr. Mano. It would be fairly high and it would depend on the<br>particular design.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What do you mean by particular design ?<br>Two percent is fairly high for some people.</p>
<p>|<br>}</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 307</p>
<p>Mr. Manopiu. The results from Shippingport may give you some<br>feel for this. In the Shippingport design, as indicated previously,<br>about 53 percent of the power 1s produced by the natural uranium<br>blanket. At the start, this blanket contained 7 grams of U**? in every<br>kilogram of natural uranium. At the end of four seeds of operation,<br>every kilogram of natural uranium will contam 7 grams of plutonium<br>anda much smaller amount of U***.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But how many grams do you burn?</p>
<p>Mr. Manpi. I do not have the number in grams. Percentagewise<br>slightly over 50 percent of the plutonium atoms formed would be<br>fissioned in the present Shippingport core at the end of four seeds.<br>In a design where 65 percent of the total core power 1s generated by<br>the blanket over 70 percent of the plutonium atoms formed would be<br>fissioned.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If you want those figures, we can get them.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Would it be 14 or 50 or 10? What order<br>of magnitude are we talking about here? ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Could we work up the figures and put them in<br>the record? ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That would be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Mr. Manvu.. Mr. Hosmer, the question I think you want answered<br>is the following : For every atom of enriched uranium that 1s destroyed<br>in the core, how many atoms of plutonium are formed and what<br>percentage of the plutonium is burned up. The total number of<br>plutonium atoms formed for every atom of U2** destroyed will be<br>under 0.8—probably 0.7 at Shippingport at the end of four seeds.<br>This number increases as the fraction of core power from the blanket<br>increases.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I thought the 0.8 of a percent was what<br>your production of plutonium in a blanket against uranium 235 burned.<br>” Mr. Manpu. That is correct. In a seed-blanket core, the seed—<br>which is the small fully enriched portion of the core—keep driving<br>neutrons into the blanket. These neutrons fission part of the enriched<br>U285 which occurs naturally in natural uranium, and transforms the<br>natural uranium into plutonium which in turn fissions. This is why<br>the blanket of a seed-blanket core has a very long life. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are not burning the natural uranium ?</p>
<p>Mr. Manpi. You first burn a part of the enriched uranium natu-<br>rally occurring in the blanket. ; ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but that is a negative<br>factor. You are trying to make money on what you generate.</p>
<p>Mr. Manprz. At Shippingport with the first core, for example, at<br>the end of the fourth seed each kilogram of natural uranium in the<br>blanket. will contain 7 grams of plutonium and 2 grams of U**. Thus<br>the blanket will contain just as much plutonium at the end of four<br>seeds at is had U2** at the very beginning. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. On that basis you are talking about plu-<br>tonium ? .</p>
<p>Mr. Manpr. The total number of atoms of plutonium produced<br>per atom of U*** fissioned depends on the design of the core and spe-<br>cifically on the fraction of power generated by the blanket. Admiral<br>Rickover mentioned the number 0.8. This number could vary from</p>
<p>308 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>about 0.6 to 1.0 depending on the power fraction. For a 65-percent<br>blanket power fraction, the number is practically 1.0.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are burning two different fuels. You<br>are attempting to burn your 0.7 of U*** and you are attempting to<br>manufacture some plutonium and burn it in place.</p>
<p>Mr. Manou. Yes, sir; and the reactivity of the blanket is main-<br>tained by the fact that while you are burning the naturally occurring<br>U5, you are also forming plutonium. ‘As I mentioned before, at<br>the end of four seeds the Shippingport blanket will contain 2 grams<br>of U* and 7 grams of plutonium in every kilogram of natural<br>uranium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are confusing it. Iam trying to find<br>out how much of the plutonium that you manufacture you are burn-<br>ing and that isthe figure the admiral said he would furnish.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We will furnish that figure, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You said to the effeet——</p>
<p>Chairman Houirrerp. Excuse me; are you asking the admiral now<br>to give figures based on experience with the present Shippingport<br>reactor or based on what he thinks the concept of a new type, larger-<br>type reactor will be? I wanted to get that clear.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understood at this point he could not:<br>giveusa figure. I would like to have both.</p>
<p>_Admiral Rrcxover. I can only give you the figure for the Ship-<br>pingport reactor.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrrerp. I wanted to make that clear. There was<br>testimony before our committee that if this new study turned out<br>properly or constructively that there would be considerable increase<br>in the burnup in the blanket.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.rrtetp. I wanted to be sure we are talking about the<br>same thing here.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Let me phrase the question which IT am sup-</p>
<p>osed to answer. I will put into the record the figure which Mr.</p>
<p>osmer asked for the Shippingport reactor at the end of four seeds<br>of operation. This figure is based on approximately 53 percent of<br>the total core power being generated by the natural blanket. In the<br>large reactor plant I am proposing to work on, I expect that as much<br>as 65 percent of the total core power will be generated by the natural<br>uranium blanket. : .</p>
<p>(Subsequently, the following statement was submitted by Admiral<br>Rickover for the record :)</p>
<p>At the end of four seeds of operation, the Shippingport core will have pro-<br>duced a total of 145 kilograms of plutonium of which 75 kilograms will have<br>been fissioned, leaving a net of 70 kilograms in the core.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You don’t expect to go betier than one?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I think perhaps the confusion results<br>from the difference between a conversion reactor and a breeder reac-<br>tor. In a breeder you create more fissionable atoms than you had<br>when you started; but in a conversion reactor, you have less fissionable<br>atoms than you had when you started.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You have to get into the fast reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; the difference between conversion and</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 309</p>
<p>breeding is when you pass the 1.0 mark. No one is contemplating<br>any thermal reactor today that will do that. .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Isn’t this fast ceramics reactor contem-<br>plating that ? ;</p>
<p>Admiral ‘Ricxover. Yes, sir; but I am talking about the thermal<br>power reactors. One problem in the design of breeders is that they re-<br>quire tremendous quantities of fissionable material. None of the re-<br>actors now being considered as having a major role in the atomic<br>power program for the next 10 years or more are breeders. They are<br>all converters. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You stated the most economic use of natu-<br>ral resources is your standard of economy. ; ;</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That certainly is one of my main considerations.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Under that standard it seems to me you<br>would be getting into the breeder field. ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I believe a breeder—even if practical—is a very<br>long way off. What I am proposing is the design and development of<br>a large reactor that can be placed in service in about 5 to 6 years and<br>which will furnish the necessary technology for the large nuclear<br>powerplants that will be built in the next 10 to 15 years. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. If you are going to go after something that<br>is really economic, it seems to me you should go after something that<br>gives you better than 1.0. ; ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The breeder-type reactor is an entirely different<br>concept. I expect you will have to spend many, many millions of<br>dollars and many, many years of effort before a practical breeder re-<br>actor is obtained. I do not believe it would be wise to depend on the<br>ultimate practicability of breeders, and design and build no other types<br>at this time. I have heard no one, in or out of the AEC, make such a<br>statement. This is not the issue in this case.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. AEC has received a proposal for a fast<br>ceramic reactor. They claim they can do essentially what you are<br>going to do for around $15 or $20 million.</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrmxp. Wait a minute. I would like to know about<br>this proposal.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. This is the one the people in the other room<br>discussed with us. .</p>
<p>Mr. Ramey. It would not be until 1978 until you had a prototype in<br>operation.</p>
<p>Chairman Hottrtetp. Those are dreams. It is not a proposal before<br>this committee to build that type of reactor.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am trying to evaluate what. we are trying<br>to do here. The admiral feels we should not use oil, we should be<br>using uranium, and I am trying to get to the point of why shouldn’t<br>we be trying to use uranium where we are doing a good job of breeding<br>rather than using it up as this plant should do.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.trtevp. Did you say we should not use oil ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I said it is foolhardy to use oil or coal if we<br>could use something else, sir. .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you desire to save as much of these<br>natural resources as possible?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think that is a most important objective but<br>we must go about it in a realistic and practical way.</p>
<p>310 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>_Representative Hosmer. Because of the recoverable aspects of it.<br>You did not tell us not to.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No. We must go about this in a practical way.<br>ae you were to carry it to an extreme we would all-have tq walk home</p>
<p>onight.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I would like to evaluate this since we are<br>getting into an expensive project such as this. Do you feel that<br>we should conserve it because we use it up and then the future gen-<br>erations do not have anything?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Roughly 25 years ago there wasn’t any<br>other source of energy in sight. It was all conventional and then<br>all of a sudden nuclear fission develops. How about fusion ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It may come, but I would say it is a very long<br>way away.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then we have done all of the saving for<br>nothing.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If you were sure that you are going to obtain<br>energy some other way, then this committee would be wise to stop<br>all development of atomic power.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am trying to bring out that there are<br>other considerations. I seem to be the only one on my side of the<br>committee.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You have to be practical in deciding how you<br>go about conserving our natural resources. The steps we envision<br>today may only be good for 20 or 30 years when we can develop some<br>better ways of obtaining our energy requirements. But that does<br>not mean we should do nothing in the expectation that there will<br>be a better way of conserving our natural resources. For example<br>some people think we can solve the population problems on earth<br>by sending people off to the planets, but this has yet to be<br>demonstrated.</p>
<p>POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES OF SEED-BLANKET CORE</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I would like to get back again to<br>types of anticipated benefits from this project could possibly. he<br>achieved by a smaller project. ey</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The characteristics of a reactor core are very<br>much dependent on its size and geometry. One of the main objectives<br>of the project is to obtain as much energy as possible from the natural<br>uranium blanket; the size of the core is most important for this<br>consideration. The physics problems are different, control problems<br>and stability problems of a different nature have to be resolved ; differ-<br>ent types of thermal, mechanical and hydraulic problems are gen-<br>erated because of size. Our experience in the naval and Shipping-<br>port programs fully confirm this. In this connection, I do not know<br>whether the committee has yet been informed, but. about a week ago<br>we reached full power on the destroyer prototype which your cae<br>mittee authorized about 4 or 5 years ago. This reactor project took<br>years to design and develop—the core was of different physical size<br>and power output than other cores. Many different reactor prob-</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 311</p>
<p>lems had to be resolved and the technology we had at the time was<br>not sufficient to solve them. We are placing two of these reactor<br>plants on a destroyer and that destroyer will be capable of steaming<br>150,000 to 180,000 miles at full power. This reactor took a tremendous<br>amount of work because there were differences in it from our pre-<br>vious designs. The same thing is going to apply on a much larger<br>scale on this large civilian reactor which I am envisaging. I want<br>to incorporate advanced concepts in it. I don’t yet know what these<br>advanced concepts are going to be.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirtecp. At the present time you are not advocating<br>building their type of a reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir.</p>
<p>STUDY TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY OF SEED-BLANKET APPROACH</p>
<p>Chairman Houmrerp. You are advocating a study to determine<br>whether such a reactor would be feasible some time in the future and<br>you are advocating it in a step-by-step program, seven million and a<br>half for the first step and then if the Atomic Energy Commission<br>and the committee decides that you have made progress or that it<br>looks promising we may take another bite at it, maybe $5 million or<br>$10 million and 3 or 4 years from now with all of these ifs in between,<br>if we come to the point where we think it justifiable you would<br>come forward and advocate a reactor and you think at this time it<br>might be between 400,000- or 500,000-kilowatt size but you don’t<br>know today whether it will be 800,000 or 300,000, do you?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Conversely, I would say that if at the end of the<br>year, before I spent this initial appropriation, if it looks to me that<br>this project is not worthwhile, I would come and give you my conclu-<br>sion. I would not wait.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirrerp. I want the record to be very clear what we<br>are considering today is a $7.5 million appropriation for a study of<br>this problem. We have done this before in many instances. We have<br>authorized studies of different designs. Later on some of those studies<br>have been turned down and later on some of them have been im-<br>plemented. I want the record to be clear on that. I don’t want to<br>face an argument on the floor of the House that you advocated the<br>spending of $2 million to come up with this $7.5 million appropria-<br>tion.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. If I did not believe that this project had suffi-<br>cient technical merit to warrant ultimate construction of such a plant,<br>I would not start it. One has to have the courage of his convictions<br>to know what he can do and I am being frank with the committee when<br>I tell you I believe it will come out allright. But I am not advocating</p>
<p>that you today authorize construction or that you appropriate money</p>
<p>for any such construction.</p>
<p>We had the same relationship on the Shippingport reactor. I<br>had to come before this committee every year to get new appropria-<br>tions. I did not have carte blanche to spend money.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I think as long as you are the man who<br>comes up here to get the money there is a certain amount of certitude</p>
<p>that the Congress is going to give it.</p>
<p>312 AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. What you say may be so but I think Congress<br>judges past performance in reaching decisions.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are mulling around anywhere from<br>3 to 5 years before you start construction. ‘ ;</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I think about 3 years. This is an offhand state-<br>ment, sir, I cannot at the present time give you a firmer statement. I<br>have no basis today on which to give you an estimate.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You would not freeze at that point. You<br>would not freeze until some time along in the construction.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. After 214 or 3 years of development work you<br>usually have enough knowledge about the reactor you are designing<br>that you can place the order for the pressure vessel. This is a con-<br>trolling component in the design and construction of the plant. That<br>is one of the first decisions you have to make—how big is the pressure<br>vessel going to be; what are its dimensions.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. The size of your pressure vessel<br>at ‘a maximum on this 500,000-kilowatt reactor ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I fully expect that the reactor I envision will<br>have an output of about 500,000 kilowatts electrical. It may develop<br>later on, as we go along, that possibly it should be larger than that.<br>At that time we would have to make a decision on whether it is worth-<br>while extending the development for another year or so. Normally it<br>is not advisable to do so. When you see that you can make a big<br>advance in technology, you are better off to start in on that.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. There are points beyond which you can-<br>not extrapolate.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You probably can extrapolate to some extent<br>for 150,000 to 200,000 kilowatts, maybe a little more.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Shippingport ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. I am referring to the Shippingport<br>reactor where the second core has a rating of 150,000 kilowatts elec-<br>trical.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You can extrapolate from Shippingport<br>into this?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If there were a shortage of electric power in<br>the United States and we had to build large nuclear plants as quickly<br>as possible, if that were the case, I could build a larger plant now<br>with the technology we have available.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. We have a rule of thumb from the 202<br>hearings we learned it was roughly five times as far as you could go<br>in boosting the size. Do you go for that?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I think you are getting arithmetic<br>made easy.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. This is a rule of thumb that most people<br>go by and I thought perhaps you were going by it, too.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; I have not heard about such a rule.<br>From my experience, I would certainly question its validity.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.uirmxp. I am glad to learn about this rule of thumb.<br>This is my first knowledge of it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I never heard of it, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. It states you are getting a thousand mega-<br>watt-days per ton out of the Shippingport plant.</p>
<p>are you</p>
<p>AEC AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION, FISCAL YEAR 1963 313</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We are presently finishing operation with the<br>third seed and expect to install the fourth seed in the fall of this<br>year. At the end of the fourth seed the oe burnup in the blanket<br>will be about 9,000 megawatt-days per ton of UO:.</p>
<p>Repro Hosmer. Would it go on? y</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We have examined the fuel elements 1n the<br>blanket and they only have about 1,000th of an inch of crud deposit.<br>For all practial pae: a the elements are in excellent condition. As<br>you know, the reactor has about 100,000 individual fuel elements.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Would the Congressman oblige us, if he can, how<br>long he will be?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am just about through. ;</p>
<p>Senator Pastorr. We have been holding up a lot of witnesses on<br>the authorization bill, and I wonder how long this committee desires<br>to go? These are important people and busy people, and I do not<br>want to hold them here any longerthan wehave to. _ .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am not going to apologize for taking the</p>
<p>_ time.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. I am not asking anybody to do anything. I just<br>ask the question if the Congressman could tell me just about how<br>long heintendstobe. Task it respectfully. ; ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. As soon as I get some information on the<br>life of these fuel elements that is the last question I have. ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. May I answer this question, sir? The Ship-<br>pingport reactor has about 100,000 fuel elements and we designed it<br>so it could operate even if 1,000 of these elements failed. So far, after<br>over 4 years of operation we have had evidence of possible minor<br>defects in only 3 of the 100,000 fuel rods.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What kind of life would you expect out of<br>these elements? . ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. From the examinations we have carried out on<br>the Shippingport natural uranium fuel, I believe I could run the<br>Shippingport blanket for another 4 years. That is, the initial charge<br>of natural uranium could last for as long as about 8 years. It has<br>already operated satisfactorily for over 4 years.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Could the utilization of the natural U**<br>which has been 0.7 of 1 percent down to this 3 percent, does that<br>change your characteristics or does the replacement compensate fully</p>
<p>r it?<br>in id Ricxover. The reactivity of the natural uranium blanket<br>has kept up very well and the reactor has maintained its 60,000-<br>kilowatt electrical capacity.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Any questions from the Senator from Vermont?</p>
<p>Senator ArkEN. No, sir. :</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Questions of the chairman ?</p>
<p>Chairman Horirimtp. No questions.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Thank you very much, Admiral. __</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and the<br>committee for this opportunity to talk with you.</p>
