      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this March 30, 1963, *Saturday Evening Post* article, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover sounds an alarm about the &quot;Decline of the Individual&quot; in American society, attributing it to a fading sense of freedom and dignity. He identifies several critical threats: a societal shift from a self-responsible &quot;Protestant ethic&quot; to a conforming &quot;Freudian ethic&quot;; the unchecked influence of technology, exemplified by the dangers of pesticides and the thalidomide tragedy; rapid population growth, which has led to overcrowding (with 7 out of 10 Americans living in urban areas) and a diminished sense of individual importance; and the proliferation of powerful public and private &quot;giant organizations.&quot; These entities, Rickover argues, interpose between citizens and their government, eroding personal freedom and fostering authoritarianism. Citing principles from the Declaration of Independence, Rickover calls for a re-centering of the individual, urging Americans to regain control over technological advancements, curb the illegitimate powers of large organizations, and draw lessons from European democracies to strengthen the autonomous citizen and secure the nation&#x27;s future.</p>

        <p>THE SATURDAY EVENING</p>
<p>THE SATURDAY</p>
<p>FOUNDED BV</p>
<p>DECLINE OF THE</p>
<p>1 upon the American people. We have lost some<br>48. of our exuberance, some of our faith in our-<br>selves. Many of us are disturbed by the loss of<br>good things we cherish as peculiarly American<br>and by the intrusion of distasteful things we never<br>expected would invade our way of life. These<br>changes have been many and various, but they<br>all have a common root: They stem from factors<br>which have conspired to diminish the freedom<br>and dignity of the individual.</p>
<p>These human values are essential in a democ-<br>racy; anything that threatens them makes our<br>whole society a little less free, our nation a little<br>less strong. The basic tenet of democracy is re-<br>spect for the equal moral worth of all human<br>beings and the equal freedom of all men to shape<br>their lives as they see fit, provided only that they<br>harm no one and violate no law. Only the self-<br>determining, independent citizen can make a<br>success of self-government.</p>
<p>Yet these same values can be neither created<br>nor preserved without continuous effort, and that<br>effort must come from the people—or rather<br>from the individual citizen. Self-government will<br>not produce a good society unless enough citizens<br>feel an identification with the fate of the nation.<br>Repeating patriotic clichés is not enough.</p>
<p>Even were it conceivable that we might prefer<br>things to freedom—perhaps self-indulgence or<br>social irresponsibility or political apathy—the<br>peril in which our country finds itself today for-<br>bids such folly. In its struggle with Communism,<br>democracy cannot afford to forgo a single one<br>of the advantages inherent in a free society: the<br>mutual trust that flourishes in freedom, the re-<br>tease of human initiative and energy, the prag-<br>saatism and tolerance that prevent enslavement</p>
<p>» dogmatic ideology—these are what give de-<br>mocracy flexibility and strength.</p>
<p>Our nation was launched with a system of<br>government containing numerous safeguards to<br>protect individual liberties. Careful reading of<br>ihe Declaration of Independence shows that our<br>society pivots on the free citizen. Observe the<br>order of precedence: First there is the statement<br>that all men are born equally endowed with “un-</p>
<p>[i recent years a sense of uneasiness has crept</p>
<p>THE</p>
<p>NDIVIDUAL</p>
<p>_ By Vice Admiral H. G. RICKOVER</p>
<p>alienable rights,” and some of these are listed ;<br>then the Declaration notes that governments “are<br>instituted among men” to “secure” these rights,<br>and finally it is stated that government derives its<br>“just powers” from the governed. Clearly the<br>founding fathers wanted to make certain that<br>Americans never would be ruled by anyone who<br>had not received their express mandate.</p>
<p>Over the years, however, and especially since<br>the coming of the industrial and later the scientific<br>revolution, radical changes have occurred in our<br>way Of life, some of them inimical to the free indi-<br>vidual in whom our society is grounded.</p>
<p>lies in the replacement of what sociologists</p>
<p>call the Protestant ethic, which prevailed in<br>this country until the turn of the century, by a<br>new so-called Freudian ethic. Put in simple terms,<br>the Protestant and Freudian ethics stand for two<br>opposite concepts of man. The first sees him<br>shaping his own destiny, being governed by stan-<br>dards he sets himself and by his own conscience,<br>therefore responsible for his own acts. It is the<br>spiritual foundation of democracy. The second<br>sees man ruled by unconscious drives and exter-<br>nal pressures, hence not really responsible for his<br>acts. His life is shaped not by himself but by his<br>socioeconomic environment; if he becomes a fail-<br>ure or a criminal, not he but society is to blame.</p>
<p>American egalitarianism reinforces this carica-<br>ture of Freud’s concepts. Mediocrity excuses it-<br>self as the normal and healthy state of mankind.<br>The uncommon man who excels thus becomes a<br>sort of unnatural freak. Conformity to the en-<br>vironment in which one happens to find oneself<br>becomes the safe and approved aim. That this<br>shrivels individual autonomy is a fact not always<br>immediately perceived.</p>
<p>The process starts with the “progressive”<br>school and the permissive home. Emphasis is<br>placed. on self-expresson rather than on self-<br>discipline; on group adjustment rather than on<br>development of the individual’s innate capacities ;<br>on gaining popularity with the “peer” group<br>rather than on becoming an independent, self-<br>determining adult human being. The education-</p>
<p>T first major threat to individual freedom</p>
<p>ists’ avowed intent to use the school for leveling<br>out human differences strikes me as an assault on<br>the child’s basic humanity. Unlike animals who<br>are equipped only for the one kind of life proper<br>to their species—peer group, if you like!—man<br>is infinitely diverse in talents and interests. The<br>higher the cultural level, the greater this diversity ;<br>passive adjustment to a group belongs to a more<br>primitive age of man.</p>

What is particularly disturbing is the<br>resentment that tends to be generated in these<br>closed groups against anyone who thinks inde-<br>pendently and who must therefore at times differ<br>from approved “group thought.”</p>
<p>All new ideas begin in a noncomforming mind<br>that questions some tenet of the “conventional<br>wisdom.” All improvements originate in a<br>critical mind that mistrusts the “image” pro-<br>jected by some powerful organism. The innovator<br>of ideas and the social critic are essential to a free<br>society; they are what make the society free.</p>

<p>but there is also need of “lay critics” who look<br>upon discovery and publication of truth as part<br>of their civic responsibility. The critic who makes<br>himself an expert on some particular subject, so<br>that he may offer the people information not<br>otherwise available, ought surely to be able to<br>count the people on his side. But, all too often,<br>habits of conformity and mistrust of iconoclasts.<br>lead the public to take a neutral position, as if<br>they were judging a proceeding in a court of law.<br>Itisasad comment on the decline of individual-<br>ism in America that the critic has no friend at<br>court.

<p>may be misquoted and misrepresented, and what</p>
<p>he says may be contemptuously dismissed as re-<br>quiring no refutation whatever.</p>
<p>A second major threat to individual freedom<br>comes from the impact of technology. The utili-<br>zation of science for practical purposes has such<br>enormous potential for the good or evil of man<br>and society that our attitude toward it requires<br>careful rethinking. We have here a complex<br>problem that calls for a higher order of intelli-<br>gence than has so far been applied. Up to now<br>we have left technological matters almost entirely<br>to the management of practical men. I submit,<br>however, that the practical approach to a new<br>scientific discovery is short-range and private ; it<br>is concerned with ways to put a discovery to use<br>in the most economical and efficient manner. The<br>scholarly approach is long-range and public; it<br>looks to the effects which the use of a new discov-<br>ery may have on people in general, on the nation,<br>perhaps on the world, and it considers the future<br>as well as the present.</p>
<p>To “controversial” tag makes him by defi-</p>
<p>categorical imperatives of nature, impera-</p>
<p>tives constantly being disregarded for the<br>sake of short-range benefits. I feel strongly that<br>technology must not be raised to the status of an<br>end in itself, but must always remain a means to<br>an end, the end being the welfare of human<br>beings and of the nation as a whole. In determin-<br>ing whether a given technology conforms to this<br>objective, we need the help of both practical and<br>scholarly experts. But the final decision must rest<br>with the American people.</p>
<p>It disturbs me that we allow ourselves to be<br>pressured by purveyors of technology into<br>permitting so-called technical progress to alter<br>our lives without attempting to control this<br>development—almost as if technology were an<br>irrepressible force of nature to which we must<br>meekly submit. If we but paused to reflect before<br>acting, we should note that much which is hailed<br>as progress contributes little or nothing to<br>human happiness. Everything new is not eo ipso<br>good and everything old inferior.</p>
<p>Technology does not automatically render<br>obsolete the principles we found good in the<br>past; they belong to a different order of things.<br>Technology is not concerned with them. Princi-<br>ples have to do with the way we marshal our<br>inner resources, discipline our actions and re-<br>spond to the promptings of our conscience; with<br>the ordering of our personal lives and of our<br>relations with fellow citizens, both in private<br>and in public life. They apply to human beings.</p>
<p>Technology, on the other hand, deals with<br>material things. Technology can enlarge our<br>powers of mind and body. With it we can im-<br>prove health, produce material abundance, lei-<br>sure and comfort, circle the earth with instant<br>communications, etc. But technology does not<br>dictate either the manner in which we put it to<br>use or the specific benefits which we want to de-<br>rive from using it.</p>
<p>I suggest we reject the notion that man is no<br>longer master of his own and of his society’s</p>
<p>A s an engineer I have a healthy respect for the</p>
<p>destiny. Let us put man back in the center of<br>the stage and do some hard thinking about the<br>kind of life that technology is currently creating<br>for us. Only now, for example, are we beginning<br>to realize that careless use of dangerous pesti-<br>cides and weed killers may poison soil, vegetation,<br>animals and humans. And it took the tragic case<br>of the European thalidomide babies to dramatize<br>the fatal consequences that may result from the<br>hasty use of inadequately tested drugs.</p>
<p>A third threat to individual freedom has been<br>the tremendous increase in the country’s popu-<br>lation, with all the attendant changes that this<br>has brought. From 1800 to 1850 our population<br>almost quintupled; from 1850 to 1900 it tripled ;<br>from 1900 to 1950 it doubled. Natural increase<br>had as much to do with this growth as immigra-<br>tion. Since World War II the growth rate has<br>accelerated so much that when the time comes<br>to celebrate our bicentenary each citizen will<br>have only about one percent of the voting power<br>which individual Americans had in our first<br>national election. A healthy infant born on that<br>day can expect within his lifetime to see our<br>population soar close to the billion mark—unless,<br>of course, we ponder the consequences to the<br>quality of American life and reverse the trend.</p>
<p>Space of itself bestows freedom and dignity;<br>it gives man elbowroom and a chance to find<br>peace and quiet and privacy. When men are<br>scarce each individual becomes important. Today<br>seven out of 10 Americans live in crowded cities,<br>suburbs, and other urban areas, and the country<br>as a whole is more populous per square mile than<br>was Europe at the time of our revolution. It is<br>hard to find quiet and privacy and a spot of un-<br>spoiled nature within reach of home. Man-made<br>ugliness presses on the human spirit, and there is<br>no place for our children to play in safety.</p>
<p>there was work in abundance, work of a</p>
<p>kind that ordinary men with willing hearts<br>and hands could do, vitally needed work that be-<br>stowed dignity on the workman. We were a coun-<br>try of independent farmers, artisans and merchants<br>in those days. Now nine out of ten Americans<br>work for others, many for giani organizations<br>where they have little opportunity to feel individ-<br>ually important. Today, moreover, our society is<br>plagued with endemic unemployment, a condi-<br>tion under which it is difficult to hold fast to a<br>sense of human worth. The loss falls most heavily<br>on those—and, alas, there are all too many—who<br>lack the skill and education for which there is<br>demand in a complex modern society. In the past,<br>America offered unique opportunities for social<br>advancement to average men with average com-<br>petence; today this is less and less true. America<br>once offered steady employment even to men<br>of below-average ability, but job opportunities<br>for them have contracted drastically. Ours is stili<br>a land of opportunity, but increasingly so only<br>for the highly skilled and educated.</p>
<p>With the disappearance of preindustrial, rural<br>America we lost a way of life that was congenial<br>to individual freedom and democracy. Life was<br>simple. Ordinary men could understand the<br>world they lived in; they could manage their<br>affairs without much trouble; they could reach<br>independent decisions on public issues that con-<br>cerned them as citizens of a democracy. The</p>
<p>AN long as a wilderness had to be subdued</p>
<p>individual is diminished when he cannot compre-<br>hend the problems besetting his nation. I myself<br>think that if we had a first-rate school system,<br>stressing basic education in the liberal arts, many<br>more Americans than now would understand and<br>express their views on public issues.</p>
<p>Serious as is the loss of these natural advan-<br>tages, however, it need not be fatal to individual<br>freedom or to preservation of a free society.<br>Many of the most civilized modern European<br>countries never had these advantages, yet they<br>were able to evolve out of feudalism and capitalist<br>monarchy into democratic nations where indi-<br>vidual freedom is at least as well protected as<br>here—and in some cases better protected. What<br>we need is a new perspective: a recognition that<br>we must now take positive action to create<br>“artificially” the climate in which the autono-<br>mous individual and the free society can prosper.</p>
<p>the rise of giant organizations which inter-</p>
<p>pose themselves between the citizen and<br>his government. When the nation was founded we<br>did not even have political parties, and there were<br>only seven commercial corporations in all the<br>colonies. We had no labor unions, no vocational<br>or professional associations, no special-interest<br>groups or huge government bureaucracies. The<br>citizen faced his government directly—whether<br>local, state or Federal. With his fellow citizens he<br>shared control over his government on a basis<br>of complete equality.</p>
<p>Today the citizen’s wishes may be thwarted if<br>they conflict with the interests of powerful orga-<br>nizations able to bring their immense resources to<br>bear on government. Many organizations, such<br>as labor unions and even women’s clubs, have<br>been successful in preventing governmental</p>
<p>A fourth major threat to individual freedom is</p>
<p>. action they consider harmful to their interests,</p>
<p>or in obtaining special government benefits and<br>privileges not vouchsafed ordinary citizens. When.<br>society is dominated by powerful organizations<br>the autonomy of the individual is diminished.</p>
<p>Of course, the right to associate with others<br>for the purpose of engaging in joint enterprises<br>is itself an important part of individual freedom.<br>In a huge, populous, technically advanced coun-<br>try such as ours both private and public organiza-<br>tions are indispensable. Enormous good flows<br>from them. Many organizations, furthermore, are<br>exclusively concerned with serving their members<br>and do not seek to influence anyone; others are<br>small and therefore a threat to no one; not a few<br>are big and powerful but exemplary in behavior<br>and performance. These do not concern us here.<br>What does concern us is the threat to individual<br>freedom posed by huge power complexes which<br>dominate our lives but over which we are not<br>able to exercise control. Among these are both<br>public and private organizations.</p>
<p>Large government bureaucracies are as in-<br>dispensable to modern society as are large<br>private organizations. Many government tasks<br>have to be entrusted to special agencies set up<br>for this purpose. Yet, although they are a part<br>of government, the citizen’s influence on them is<br>not as effective as it is on the elected branches of<br>government; nor are the men who. run these<br>bureaucracies as accessible to citizens who have<br>legitimate business with them as are elected<br>government officials.</p>
<p>__EVER OF PROTECTION FROM HIS FELLOW CITIZENS.” _</p>
<p>Many large nongovernmental organizations<br>also tend to misuse their power in relations with<br>the public and the government, as when they<br>seek to hold up necessary legislation favored by<br>the electorate or win special favors as a result of<br>past political support—or through the threat of<br>future retaliation at the polls. In some cases,<br>moreover, these organizations develop an auto-<br>cratic structure which diminishes the freedom<br>and dignity of employees or members, either by<br>needlessly circumscribing their working—and<br>occasionally even their private—lives, or by fail-<br>ing to be responsive to their best interests. Often<br>those “faults of bigness,” as one might call them,<br>are not essential to the purposes of the organiza-<br>tion or even relevant to their specific tasks. Once<br>we recognize what makes large organization a<br>danger to freedom, we can deal with the problem<br>without interfering with their lawful pursuits. In<br>fact, protection of individual freedoms will bene-<br>fit any honest organization, since it releases<br>private initiative, one of the great powers for<br>good inherent in a free society.</p>
<p>Organizations act through men. In our country<br>they act through a special category of career<br>men, called managers or administrators. The<br>18th-century French statesman Mirabeau once<br>remarked that “to administer . . . is to rule.”’ One<br>might expand this to say that administration is a<br>type of authoritarian rule with no constituency<br>and no direct popular mandate. As such it is an<br>anomaly in a democratic society.</p>
<p>tration stands apart and above production.</p>
<p>The men who do the real work of the organiza-<br>tion are placed below the administrators who rule<br>them. Administrators may or may not have<br>competence in the organization’s special field of<br>work; often they do. Unhappily they often do<br>not. Take education: Clearly the teachers do all<br>the productive work, but it is not they who<br>manage the vast educational enterprise in this<br>country. Teachers are bossed by administrators<br>who quite frequently have not been trained in<br>teaching but only in management of housekeep-<br>ing, personnel and public-relations chores.</p>
<p>The larger an organization, the more powerful<br>are the managers or administrators. Their source<br>of power comes from being in charge of house-<br>keeping matters, hence of the purse and so in<br>turn of personnel assignment and promotion. As<br>with all rulers, the larger the realm, the more<br>important and better paid are its administrators.<br>This makes them empire builders. It also accounts<br>for a tendency to authoritarianism. Orders flow<br>downward freely, but suggestions rarely rise up-<br>ward in the hierarchy. This is probably more<br>true of public than of private organizations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the individual who must work in<br>a large organization, whether private or public,<br>meets conditions of inequality not found else-<br>where in our democratic society. Nor is this in-<br>equality necessarily a result of unequal human<br>qualities; it comes because one party has behind<br>him the power of the organization and uses it to<br>prevail over the other. This reminds one un-<br>comfortably of the special rights and privileges<br>which once were enjoyed by men for no other<br>reason than membership in a higher estate—as<br>when society was divided into the nobility, the<br>clergy and the third estate.</p>
<p>I nearly all our large organizations adminis-</p>
<p>There is yet another way in which large organi-<br>zations tend to diminish the freedom of the indi-<br>vidual. The founding fathers sought to secure the<br>“ynalienable rights” of man by associating the<br>citizen with the business of governing; that is, by<br>making the consent of the people indispensable to<br>the functioning of government. In order to exer-<br>cise his public functions a citizen must be free to<br>make up his own mind on any public issue, to<br>speak out and to solicit the approval of his fellow<br>citizens; in other words, to be active politically.</p>
<p>citizen needs what Socrates called “‘a pri-</p>
<p>vate station” when he engages in public<br>activities. More than invasions of privacy, intoler-<br>able in a free society, are therefore involved when<br>organizations presume to meddle in their em-<br>ployees’ personal lives. Can a man who must<br>submit to organizational regimentation be a<br>fully effective democratic citizen? Will he feel<br>free to engage in active politics if there is doubt<br>in his mind whether the organization he works<br>for, or the union or association to which he<br>belongs, approves?</p>
<p>Many people have been concerned over the<br>danger of our becoming a state dominated by<br>pressure groups. It has been proposed that the<br>people be given a special department to look<br>after their interests. This misreads the problem.<br>The Government in all its branches is already<br>set up specifically to look after the people’s<br>interests and for no other reason. What we must<br>do, I submit, is find ways to curb the illegitimate<br>powers of large organizations, both public and<br>private. Government bureaucracies should be<br>made more responsive to the wishes of the<br>voters; this means bringing them under closer<br>control of our elective bodies. Nongovernmental<br>organizations—labor unions, professional as-<br>sociations, special-interest groups, even business<br>corporations—ought to be held more strictly to<br>the specific mandate of their charters, as well as<br>to “public policy.”</p>
<p>We have allowed the freedom of the individual<br>to shrink while permitting the freedom of the<br>organization to expand to a point where it over-<br>shadows human liberties. But this nation was<br>founded for people, not for organizations. We<br>need to remind ourselves that organizations—<br>like technology—are not ends in themselves but<br>means to-an end. This end is a good society—a<br>strong nation—human beings who in equal mea-<br>sure are assured the right to “ife, liberty and the<br>pursuit of happiness.”</p>
<p>I have no simple solutions to offer. There are<br>no simple solutions for any of the problems<br>which urgently require our attention today. We<br>can approach . these problems from many dif-<br>ferent angles. I approach them from the point<br>of view that individual freedom must be preserved.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are now signs that give one<br>hope we have passed the nadir and are slowly<br>ascending toward the more rugged individualism<br>that was so marked a characteristic of earlier<br>Americans. The shock that Sputnik administered<br>to our self-esteem has led us to throw ourselves<br>into an earnest search for flaws in our way of<br>life. I am convinced that once the American<br>people have been shown at what points individual<br>freedom has been weakened they will speedily<br>reinforce these points.</p>
<p>Fe. in private life is important, for the</p>
<p>We will be able to do this all the better if we<br>can overcome a general tendency to think of<br>ourselves as unique. A good deal of not-wholly-<br>disinterested propaganda comes our way seeking<br>to convince us that all the good things of the life<br>we associate with American democracy are<br>uniquely ours. There was a time when life in this<br>country differed greatly from life in other<br>Western nations. For more than 100 years we<br>were the model of the free society. But ideas have<br>been moving back and forth across the Atlantic,<br>leaving deposits on both shores. Democracy as<br>4 form of government has long since become the<br>Western—not solely the American—way of life.<br>It is well also to remember that its roots go back<br>2,500 years to Greece and that in evolving the<br>concept of the equal worth of all men every<br>Western nation has played a part.</p>
<p>The greatest glory of Western civilization is<br>that it alone, on its own, came to accept the<br>idea that man as man, individual man, regardless<br>of his particular attributes or possessions, is<br>“the measure of all things” (Protagoras). Since<br>the political corollary of this idea is democratic<br>government, it is not surprising that democracy,<br>too, is a uniquely Western invention.</p>
<p>There is, to be sure, a so-called “Eastern”<br>concept of democracy: pure Marxist double-talk,<br>of course. It defines democracy as government<br>of the people, on behalf of the people, and in the<br>interest of the people.</p>
<p>In areas of the world where the individual has<br>never been held in high esteem, where he derives<br>his status and rights from membership in some<br>group-—family, tribe, church, ete.—this parody<br>of Lincoln’s famous words is sometimes actually<br>taken as a species of democracy. In a negative<br>way, this illustrates the point I wish to make<br>crystal-clear: Respect for individual freedom,<br>for the autonomous individual, is the foundation<br>of a free society. As soon as you think in terms<br>of “groups,” the foundation begins to erode.</p>
<p>problems. All are seeking to. solve them<br>through the democratic process, and each</p>
<p>can learn something from the others without be-<br>ing untrue to itself. There is, I believe, an irresist-<br>ible trend toward changing government from the<br>“night watchman” to the “service agency” type.<br>Americans could learn something from the way<br>this transition is being made in the most success-<br>ful of European democracies. Their reasons have<br>been practical, not ideological. What they have<br>recognized and accepted is that modern life is<br>now so complex, so dependent on careful dove-<br>tailing of innumerable human activities, that the<br>individual is in greater need than ever of protec-<br>tion by the law against being harmed by his<br>fellow citizens. There can be no valid objection<br>in principle against making necessary changes.<br>The Declaration of Independence states that “it<br>is the right of the people” to alter the powers of<br>government in such a way “as to them shall seem<br>most likely to effect their safety and happiness.”<br>A friendly though critical visitor to our country<br>once remarked that “there is nothing wrong with<br>America that Americans cannot set right.” We<br>can, if we will, strengthen the autonomous<br>individual in our free society. In so doing we<br>will make our nation not only stronger but also a<br>better place to live. THE END</p>
