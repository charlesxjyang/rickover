      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1959 speech, VADM H. G. Rickover passionately criticizes the American education system, arguing that it is mediocre and lags behind European and especially Russian standards, posing a threat to national survival in science and technology. He cites alarming statistics, such as Russia&#x27;s 10% lead in scientific/technical manpower in 1957, projected to reach 25% by 1961, and a 10-15 year lead in rocket control. Rickover refutes claims that Russian schools neglect humanities, stating they devote comparable time to both humanities and sciences as US schools, and criticizes American educationists for misleading the public with untrue statistics regarding graduation rates (e.g., only 55-58% of US 5th graders graduate high school, compared to a similar percentage of Russian ten-year school graduates who receive a far more rigorous education). He highlights that European children are two years ahead in arithmetic by sixth grade and gain a liberal arts education in 12-13 years, equivalent to 16 years in the US. Rickover decries the decline in US foreign language teaching, the prevalence of &quot;life-adjustment&quot; training over solid content, and the resistance to reform by &quot;professional educationists&quot; who, in his view, prioritize administrative control and &quot;democratic togetherness&quot; over academic excellence. He emphasizes his right to criticize as a concerned citizen, linking educational quality directly to national strength and the supply of qualified professionals needed for fields like nuclear propulsion.</p>

        <p>I am pleased to be here today since this year's meeting of the Edison Foundation coincides with the end of my first decade of involvement in American education. It is an honor to inaugurate my second decade by addressing this distinguished audience. May I put in a petition to the Foundation for a place on its agenda ten and twenty years from now, God willing?</p>
<p>You may think me unduly pessimistic. Why should I expect that twenty years hence, it will still be necessary to advocate reform of our schools? Are not the American people beginning to see that such reforms are essential if we are to survive as a free nation? However, if there is anything I have learned in the last ten years, it is the overwhelming power of resistance to reform possessed by organized groups with a vested interest in the status quo. Educational officialdom is such a group. It has been so successful in resisting needed reforms that we are today in grave danger of being overtaken in science and technology by a nation with a more efficient and rigorous educational system.</p>
<p>Hardly a week goes by without some news item showing Russia moving ahead in scientific knowledge or technology. A leading American mathematician reports the Soviet Union ahead of the United States by ten to fifteen years in the complicated area of accurate rocket control mechanisms--the reason being Russian leadership in the field of non-linear differential mathematics. Three United States senators return, warning us that the Soviet Union is assuming world leadership in the development of hydroelectric power. A professor of Industrial Management and Engineering discloses Russia's ability to outproduce the West in certain machine tools. These are but a few items appearing in a recent ten-day period.</p>
<p>Official statistics show that in 1957 Russia had a 10% lead in scientific and technical manpower over the United States. The Soviet force, moreover, included 30% more holders of advanced degrees. Because of faster growth rates, official estimates expect the Russians will have a 25% lead in trained manpower by 1961, with an even greater advantage in holders of advanced degrees. Space experts now concede that we are five years behind the Russians.</p>
<p>Yet many American educationists do not appear to see the connection between these scientific advances and the quality of Russian education. Not long ago one of them complained that it had never been &quot;demonstrated in any way resembling a scientific procedure of thought&quot; that Sputnik reflected a triumph of Russian education! Another urges us not to worry about keeping up with the Russians; &quot;let's keep up with the children.&quot; Still another ridicules those among us who are concerned over Russia's more efficient education, and makes the wholly unsubstantiated--and, truth to tell, somewhat ridiculous--claim that the Russians are &quot;worrying themselves sick about us.&quot;</p>
<p>One can understand educationist annoyance when Russian achievements are used to show up the mediocrity of our schools. But I am shocked and worried when I see them carelessly misleading the American public on what actually goes on in Russian education. For example, there is the wholly untrue assertion constantly being made by them that Russian schools teach only science and neglect the humanities, while ours are said to give a more rounded education. The fact is that Russian schools devote about as much time to the humanities as to the sciences and mathematics, and a great deal more to both than do our schools. Again, I constantly come upon assertions that only a tiny fraction, a small percentage, of Russia's children graduate from the ten-year schools while more than 80% of our children go to high school. In the first place, only 55-58% of our 5th graders graduate, as can be seen if one takes the trouble to consult the United States Statistical Abstract. Figures published by the United States Office of Education show that in 1957 1.6 million Russians graduated from their ten-year school, about 10% more than the number of Americans graduating from high school that year. In evaluating these figures we must keep in mind that while Russia has about 16% more people than we, World War II losses have probably brought her school-age population close to ours. In other words, she graduates about the same percentage from her rigorous ten-year schools as we from our easy high schools. Furthermore, Russia has not yet completed her present program of covering the land with ten-year schools; she is likely to graduate even more children some years hence.</p>
<p>I find such carelessness with statistics unforgivable. Not only is it untrue that only a small percentage of Russian children get a ten-year school education, the education they do get is far better than our children get after twelve years of schooling. This is obvious if one consults the examinations passed by all of these 1.6 million young Russians. These cover an amount of knowledge in mathematics, physics, chemistry, history, literature, the mother tongue, and at least one foreign language, which will rarely be possessed by young Americans unless they have completed two years of a good liberal arts college. Several times more young Russians have learned this by age 17 than young Americans by age 20. These examinations have been translated and published by the United States Office of Education and were therefore available to everyone. They have now also been included in a report of my testimony on Russian education before the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives which will be sent free of charge to anyone who writes to the Committee. I suggest American parents use these examinations as a yardstick by which to measure the achievements of their local schools.</p>
<p>I hope they will not allow themselves to be fooled by the specious argument often made by educationists that what goes on in Russian schools has no relevance for us, since Russia educates her children in order that they may be useful to the state, while we do so in order that our children may have the personal advantages a good education provides. The objective in both cases is to impart knowledge in the humanities, in mathematics and the sciences to a child growing into adulthood and, in the process, to develop his mental capacities. What is relevant for us is that Russia gets a larger percentage of her children through a rigorous course of higher secondary education than any other country, especially our own. She also gets more students to become first-rate scientists and engineers than we are able to do. Therefore, she has a larger pool of trained professionals, and is able to forge ahead of us in important areas affecting national strength and power. This is what is meant when one speaks of the Russian educational menace.</p>
<p>I hope parents will not allow themselves to be fooled by educationist misrepresentation of what critics advocate when they point to Russian educational achievements. Neither I nor other critics have ever recommended that we take over the Russian educational system; we do urge that we consider Russian educational achievements as a minimum standard for our own educational objectives. We warn that it would be suicidal if we allowed scholastic levels in our schools permanently to drop below this minimum standard. We flatly reject educationist claims, that since ours is mass education it must therefore be mediocre, or that democratic education can never be as good as education in an authoritarian society.</p>
<p>It is an old progressive gimmick to propound an antithesis between democratic and good education, as if the two were mutually incompatible. Not only is it used today to deprecate Russian educational achievement; it has always been the alibi of our educationists when one confronts them with the unquestioned superiority of European educational accomplishments. Of late, however, the critics have been bringing in evidence to prove how phony is this alleged incompatibility of excellence with equal educational opportunities. We now have ample data showing that from the first day the European child goes to school, he forges scholastically ahead of ours.</p>
<p>Recently the Council for Basic Education published a book by Charles H. Schutter and Richard L. Spreckelmeyer, entitled Teaching the Third R. In it, arithmetic textbooks here and abroad are compared in great detail. In view of the frequent accusation made by educationists that children abroad learn by rote, it is interesting to observe how much emphasis is placed in European schools on developing a &quot;figure sense&quot; in children by teaching them mental shortcuts to problems. In contrast, rote learning is quite prevalent in our own schools, and there is also far more emphasis on memorizing formulae instead of reasoning out ways to solve arithmetical problems. Tables show at what age children reach given levels of arithmetical knowledge. From Ireland to Poland, from Sweden to Italy, in England, France, Germany, Holland, Denmark--throughout Europe in fact--children move ahead so much faster that by the sixth year they are almost two years further along than our own children. This is true not only in arithmetic but in the other two &quot;R's&quot; as well. Rarely does a European child complete his formal education without being able to write legibly and correctly, but many of our college freshmen have to take remedial courses in this simple skill. Nor do normal European children fail to learn to read with ease before they enter their early teens.</p>
<p>Mind you, I am speaking of comparative achievement levels in elementary schools here and abroad. These are free public schools attended by children before they are separated by ability into different secondary schools. Thus, for elementary schooling, the stock argument of American educationists that European education is good because it is class education, and ours must necessarily be inferior because it is mass education will simply not stand up.</p>
<p>In their homogeneous secondary schools, Europeans continue to gain over our children. The abler children who attend higher secondary schools, in particular, advance much faster than children who take college-preparatory courses in high school here. Abroad, a liberal education comparing favorably with what Americans acquire in sixteen years of school and college takes but twelve years--in a very few countries, thirteen. Europeans are therefore four years ahead of Americans when they begin their professional education at a university; for most top-level professions here, a Bachelor of Art's degree is a prerequisite before one is admitted to professional school. I find it personally humiliating that most European universities also demand a Bachelor of Art's degree of Americans wishing to matriculate, while they admit all Europeans with a &quot;maturity&quot; certificate, obtained at the end of the higher secondary school.</p>
<p>For some time, I have been collecting &quot;maturity&quot; examinations from various European countries which I hope some day to translate and publish. The amount of knowledge in the humanities, in mathematics, and in the sciences required to pass these exams will rarely be possessed by American students unless they have taken a four-year liberal arts course at college. At that, few of them could pass the foreign language test of the European maturity examination. There, the student must show he can write an essay--without using a dictionary--in at least two, more often three, foreign languages. I have before me several such essays and I find them deeply disturbing. In spelling, grammar, style and composition, these essays could rarely be equalled by our best high school graduates in their own mother tongue. Few PhD candidates here could match them unless they had specialized in foreign languages. Yet American educationists constantly equate the high school diploma obtained for a college-preparatory course with the European maturity certificate. This gives our people a wholly false idea of where we stand educationally.</p>
<p>If we compare them with Russian ten-year school graduates, Europeans who have passed a &quot;maturity&quot; examination are about two years ahead of the Russians as far as basic knowledge is concerned. Their schooling also has developed in them considerable ability to think independently, and it has given them a much broader cultural background. While I feel that we should consider Russian educational achievements as minimums below which our schools must not be allowed to fall, I believe we ought to strive beyond this for the goal of matching European levels, at least for those of our children who will go on into the professions. As it is, many of them are barred from becoming professionals here because of the length of time it takes, and the high cost. In consequence, we have a chronic shortage of professional people.</p>
