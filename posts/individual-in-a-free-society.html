      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 34th Steinmetz Memorial Lecture, &quot;The Individual in a Free Society,&quot; Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover articulates deep concerns about the erosion of individual freedom and democratic principles in modern America. He identifies several key threats, including the replacement of the Protestant Ethic with a distorted &quot;Freudian Ethic&quot; that diminishes personal responsibility, the unbridled influence of technology that dictates human behavior, and the disappearance of historical advantages like abundant land and work dignity that once fostered independent citizens. Rickover&#x27;s central argument focuses on the rise of giant, bureaucratic organizations—both private and governmental—which he contends interpose themselves between the citizen and government, diminishing individual autonomy and political effectiveness. He draws upon historical figures and documents, citing the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and thinkers such as Jefferson, Madison, Eisenhower, and Freud, to emphasize the foundational importance of the autonomous individual, ultimately urging a reassertion of citizen control and critical engagement to safeguard a truly free society.</p>

<p>In recent years a sense of uneasiness has crept upon us. We have lost<br>some of our exuberance, some of our faith in ourselves. Many Americans are<br>disturbed by the loss of good things we cherish as perculiarly American, and<br>by the intrusion of distasteful things we never expected would invade our way<br>of life. If this brings home to us the fact that human values making for<br>civilized life cannot be created or preserved without continuous effort, the<br>present period of uncertainty will in the long run prove beneficial.</p>
<p>In a democracy such continuous effort must come from the people, or<br>rather from the individual citizen. Self-government will not produce a good<br>society unless enough citizens feel a sense of identification with the fate<br>of the nation. Repeating patriotic cliches is not enough; good citizenship<br>involves mental activity, as well as a sense of duty to keep our society<br>under close observation to make certain that common practices will always<br>conform to the basic tenents of democracy. One such tenent is respect for</p>
<p>the equal moral worth of all human beings and the equal right of all men to</p>
<p>be free to shape their lives as they see fit, provided only they harm no one</p>
<p>and violate no law.</p>

<p>Our political philosophy and form of goverment dave their riiaanrdtetre in<br>the American commitment to individual freedom. Conversely, democracy will not<br>survive unless the individual in our society remains autonomous, for only the<br>self-determining, independent citizen can make a success of self-government. My<br>purpose is to draw attention to certain aspects of modern life which threaten _<br>individual freedom and thus make our society a little less free and our nation<br>a little less strong.</p>
<p>The extraordinary love and devotion America inspires spring not from our<br>affluence. and comfort but from our sense of freeuom. Whatever it may cost .<br>to preserve this freedom, none of us would hesitate to pay the price. Even<br>were it conceivable that we might prefer other things to freedom--perhaps<br>self-indulgence, or social irresponsibility, or political apathy--the peril<br>in which we find ourselves today forbids such folly. Democracy labors under<br>certain handicaps when it competes or fights for survival with. a totalitarian<br>regime. It cannot afford to forego a single one of the advantages inherent in</p>
<p>a free society, all of them flowing from the freedom granted to. man: the<br>mutual trust that flourishes in freedom, the release of human initiative and<br>energy, the pragmatism and tolerance that prevent enslavement to dogmatic ideology--<br>_ these are what give democracy flexibility and strength.<br>Our nation was launched with a system of government containing numerous<br>safeguards to protect individual liberties. But in the intervening years,<br>. especially since the coming of the Industrial and later the Scientific<br>Revolution, radical changes have occurred in the American way of life, some<br>of them inimical to the autonomous individual in whom our society is grounded.</p>
<p>It is with these changes that I am concerned. A quick glance at our national</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>origins will help us understand them better.</p>
<p>At the time of the Revolution, the settled region along the Atlantic<br>seaboard was on the whole still a faithful replica of England, and most of<br>the colonists considered themselves Englishmen. The social profile differed<br>in that both the top and the bottom levels were missing, but life was not<br>noticeably more “democratic”; only one man in fourteen was considered a<br>&quot;gentleman.&quot; However, where the settled region ended and the wilderness<br>began an entiely new kind of society had begun to evolve; a society quite<br>unlike anything in the old world. It was the immense achievement of the<br>Founding Fathers that they realized this new type of society, the new kind<br>of man who developed on the frontier, the whole rich empty Continent at the<br>backdoor of the older sottlements--these offered a unique eppartantty to<br>establish here the sort ‘of Utopia that rationalist philosophers had Long<br>oe dreaming about: where, ‘regardless of birth or wealth, all men were<br>free and government was subject to their consent.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers were men of the Enlghtenment, one of the germinal<br>eras of Western civilization. They were steeped in the classics and in<br>rationalist philosophy. Indeed they were political philosophers of the first<br>rank, besides being eminently practical and skillful politicians. We have<br>never had their equal since. They took ideas that Western civilization had<br>painfully evolved over many centuries and expressed them in words of such force<br>and splendor that these not only won the enthusiastic support of the colonists<br>but have continued ever since to inspire men all over the world. The ideas<br>that sum up our political philosophy are contained in our Magna Carta--the</p>
<p>Declaration of Independence. The political framework that gives reality to them</p>
<p>is, of course, the Constitution.</p>
<p>Careful reading of the Declaration shows that our society pivots on the<br>free citizen. Observe the order of precedence: first.there is the statement<br>that all men are born equally endowed with &quot;unalienable rights&quot; and some of<br>these are listed; then the Declaration notes that governments Nare instituted<br>among men&quot; to &quot;secure&quot; these rights; and finally it is stated flatly that</p>
<p>government derives its &quot;just powers&quot; from the governed. Clearly, the Founding</p>
<p>Fathers wanted to make certain that never would Americans be ruled by_ anyone<br>who had not received their express mandate.</p>
<p>To set up a system of government subject to control of the people was<br>an extraordinary thing; all the wise and &quot;practical&quot; men of Europe knew it could<br>never work. But it did work and having proved itself in our sotaatiry, democracy<br>as reality, not as mere Utopia, made its way back to Europe. Thus the concept<br>of individual freedom came full circle. All the world now renders it<br>obeisance, bee thebaw who most blatantly violate it in practice. There is,<br>you know, a so-called &quot;eastern&quot; concept of democracy; pure Marxist double. talk,<br>of course. It defines democracy as government of the people, on behalf of the<br>people, and in the interest of the people.</p>
<p>In areas of the world where: the individual has never been held in high<br>esteem, where he derives his status and rights from membership in some group--<br>family, tribe, church etc.--in these areas this parody of Lincoln&#x27;s famous words<br>is sometimes actually taken as a species of democracy. In a negative way, this<br>Sluetwates a point I wish to make crystal clear: respect for individual freeden,<br>for the autonomous individual, is the foundation of a free society. As soon as</p>
<p>you think in terms of &quot;groups,&quot; the foundation begins to erode.</p>
<p>f~</p>
<p>This brings me to the first major threat to individual freedom: The attack<br>on the spiritual foundation of individual autonomy by the behaviorist view of man<br>or, to put it in popular terms, the replacement of the Protestant Ethic,<br>prevailing in this country until the turn of the century, by a new so-called<br>Freudian Ethic. The term does injustice to Freud who would have been horrified<br>at much of what goes by this expression. For the layman however, Protestant<br>Ethic and ‘veudian Ethie bring two opposed concepts of man into sharp focus.</p>
<p>Let me say nt the outset that I respect the so-called human or ‘behavioral<br>sciences--sociology, psychology, psychiatry-—-when they are true academic<br>disciplines, though I regret the terminology. The older term &quot;humanities&quot;<br>was more acourate. It clearly indicated the subject and did not tend<br>to mislead laymen into ascribing exactness to disciplines dealing with that<br>most unpredictable of subjects--man. Be that as it may, I fully recognize their<br>value when they are in the safe hands of first-rate scholars and professional<br>men, as. is the case abroad. But here they have bevane a@ popular fad and a<br>commercially profitable business.</p>
<p>So-called &quot; experts&quot; whose intellectual and educational qualifications are<br>well below professional Standards have become immensely influential in our schools,<br>in industrial personnel policies, in the mass media, even in art and literature.<br>They are in a fair way of transforming our free society into a &quot;manipulative<br>society&quot; where clumsy testers are allowed to probe the innermost recesses of the<br>mind and personality of children and adults; where admen use behaviorist tricks<br>to condition the public into buying what it doesn&#x27;t need and can&#x27;t afford.</p>
<p>On the occasion of his visit to this country in 1909, Freud is said to have</p>
<p>predicted we would some day use his discoveries to sell goods--to him a</p>
<p>Ar</p>
<p>profoundly shocking prospect.</p>
<p>Put in simple terms, Protestant and Freudian Ethic stand for two opposite<br>concepts. of man. The first, Calvinist in origin, sees him shaping his ow<br>destiny, being governed by standards he sets himself and by his own conscience, ©<br>therefore responsible for his om acts. ‘The second, originates in the belief<br>that man must live in society but that society compels him to suppress and<br>push into the unconscious strong instincts that are the sole or primary source<br>of human happiness, It sees man ruled by unconscious drives and external pressures,<br>hence not really responsible for his acts since he cannot help himself. His<br>life is shaped not by himself but by his socioeconomic environment; if he<br>becomes a failure or a criminal, not he but society is to blame.</p>
<p>This, at any rate, is how most laymen see the two contrasting views of man.<br>American egalitarianism reinforces this caricature of Freud&#x27;s concepts.</p>
<p>Mediocrity finds in it a splendid alibi for it looks upon itself as the normal</p>
<p>and the healthy. The Uncommon man who excels thus becomes a sort of unnatural<br>freak. Conformity to whatever the environment in which one happens to find<br>himself becomes the safe and approved aim. That this shrivels individual autonomy<br>is not immediately perceived,</p>
<p>The process starts with the progressive school and the permissive home,<br>Emphasis is placed on self-expression rather than on self-discipline; on group<br>adjustment rather than on development of the individual&#x27;s innate capacities;<br>on gaining popularity with the &quot;peer&quot; group rather than on becoming an independent,<br>self-determining adult human being. The educationists! avowed intent to use<br>the school for leveling out human differences strikes me as an assault on</p>
<p>the child&#x27;s basic humanity. Unlike animals who are equipped for only one kind</p>
<p>of Life, proper to their species--peer group if you liket--man 4s infinitely<br>3iwerse in talents and interests. The higher the cultural level, the greater<br>this diversity and the more is such diversity needed for . the proper Ponohigning<br>of society. Passive adjustment to a group belongs to a more primitive age<br>of man. It is inappropriate in our complex society.<br>Group conditioning in the school makes itself felt in adult life.<br>Increasingly, Americans seek comfort and security through belonging to a<br>particular segnent of society. People huddle together, in communities populated<br>exclusively by members of some one such segment, and pattern personal behavior<br>on group standards. What is particularly disturbing is the resentment that tends<br>to be generated in these closed groups against anyone who thinks independently<br>and who must therefore at times differ from approved &quot; group thought. &quot;</p>
<p>All new ideas begin in a nonconforming mind that questions some tenet<br>of the &quot;conventional wisdom .&quot; All improvements originate in a critical mind<br>that mistrusts the &quot;image&quot; projected by some powerful organism. The innovator<br>of ideas and the social critic are essential to a free society; they are what<br>make the society free. I an deeply disturbed at present tendencies to make<br>an outcast of anyone who innovates new ways of doing new things or who criticizes</p>
<p>old ways. Critics, in particular, are absolutely essential in a democracy like</p>
<p>ours where private and public organizations use clever public relations staffs</p>
<p>to propagandize the public.</p>
<p>A second threat to 4ndividual freedom comes from the impact of technology.<br>Technology, that is the utilization of science for practical purposes; has such<br>enormous potential for the good or evil of man and society that how we use it</p>
<p>requires careful rethinking. We have here a complex problem that calls for a</p>
<p>sigher order of intelligence than has so far been applied. We have left it almost<br>eatirely to the management of practical men. Now I subnit one can fairly say.</p>
<p>that the practical approach to a new scientific discovery is short-range and rivate;<br>it is concerned with ways to put the discovery to use in the most economical</p>
<p>and efficient manner, little thought being given to side effects and future<br>consequences. The scholarly approach--if I may use this term--is long-range</p>
<p>and public; it looks to the effects which the use of a new discovery may have</p>
<p>on people in general, on the nation, perhaps on the world; present and future.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I have a healthy respect for the categorical imperatives of</p>
<p>nature, imperatives constantly being disregarded for the sake of short-range<br>benefits. I feel strongly that technology must not be raised to the status</p>
<p>of an end in itself, but must always remain a means to an end, the end being the<br>welfare of human beings and of the nation as a whole. In determining whether</p>
<p>a given technology conforms to this objective, we need the help of both practical<br>and scholarly experts. But the final decision must rest with the American</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>It disturbs me that we allow ourselves to be pressured by purveyors of<br>technology into permitting so-called technical &quot;progress&quot; to alter our lives,<br>without attempting to control this development--almost as if technology were<br>an irrepressible force of nature to which we must meekly subnit. If we but paused<br>to reflect before acting, we should note that much hailed as progress contributes<br>little or nothing to human happiness. We need to divest ourselves of the habit<br>of regarding everything new as eo ipso good and everything old as obsolete.</p>
<p>We lose our moorings when we let ceaseless com ercial propaganda confuse</p>
<p>our sense of values; when we disparage principles thet have guided Western man</p>
<p>(or gery centuries. This may brand me as old-fashioned but I have not yet found<br>occasions to discard a single principle that was accepted in the America of my</p>
<p>i i</p>
<p>youth. Here is a homely example: lr. Micawber&#x27;s recipe for a solvent and<br>contented life: Income 20 shillings, outgo 19 shillings, result, happiness;<br>income 20 shillings, outgo 21 shillings, result, unhappiness.</p>
<p>Almost any American who followed this precept through life would end up<br>with some property to give him a sense of independence. Because we follow instead<br>the will-o&#x27;-the-wisp of the instalment plan huckster who plays on our<br>greed and on the puerile notion that we attain status by being expensively<br>&quot;packaged&quot; and propped up with numerous possessions, most of us remain what in<br>classical economics are termed &quot;proletarians,&quot; that is, propertyless.</p>
<p>The American standard of living is high, though much of our affluence is<br>not owned; we have the use of it so long as we keep up our instalment payments.<br>Awhile ago a leading magazine published two full-page spreads instructive on<br>this point. One showed a young couple living in a delightful new house,<br>equipped with all the latest conveniences and with attractive modern furnishings--<br>a gleaming new car stood in the driveway. The other picture showed how much<br>_the young family actually owned: the cement foundations of the house, the<br>wheels on the car, a few bits of furniture--the second picture looked as if a<br>hurricane had swept the property. Such a hurricane may indeed sweep it away<br>if the breadwinner loses his job. Most American families would be pretty close<br>to bankruptcy if that happened.</p>
<p>There is something topsy-turvy about the constant exhortation to go out,<br>be patriotic and buy, or the economy will collapse. Has our natiorial purpose<br>shrunk to the single objective of digging out our limited capital in nonrenewable</p>
<p>natural wealth, turning it into goods that will quickly become obsolescent, so</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>that more wealth can be dug out and more goods produced and so on<br>ad_infinitum until all our capital is gone? The implication is that<br>technology dictates human behavior and we can but obey its command.</p>
<p>I think we need to be quite clear in our minds that all this<br>is specious reasoning. Technology does not automatically render<br>obsolete the principles we found good in the past; they belong to<br>a different order of things. Technology is not concerned with them.<br>Principles have to do with the way we marshal our inner resources,<br>discipline our actions, and respond to the promptings of our conscience;<br>with the ordering of our personal lives and of our relations with<br>fellow citizens, both in private and in public life. They apply to<br>human beings.</p>
<p>Technology, on the other hand, deals with material things.<br>Technology can enlarge our powers of mind and body. With it we can<br>improve health, produce material abundance, leisure and comfort,<br>circle the earth with instant communications, etc. But technology</p>
<p>does not dictate either the manner in which we put it to use, or</p>
<p>the specific benefits we want to derive from it.</p>
<p>I suggest we reject the notion that man is no longer master<br>of his own and of his society&#x27;s destiny. Let us put man back in the<br>center of the stage and do some hard thinking about the kind of life<br>technology is currently creating for us and how we might improve it,<br>Let us not forget that under our political system it is the sovereign</p>
<p>citizen who, jointly with his fellow citizens, decides whether or</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>not to use his government for the purpose of minimizing harmful<br>uses of technology and maximizing the benefits that can be derived<br>from it.</p>
<p>We now possess scientific knowledge of such dangerous potential<br>that its use can no longer be safely left to private decision .<br>alone. In the past it was considered part of the American way<br>of life to permit private owners to despoil our Continent. We<br>allowed them to pollute our streams and lakes, to denude our<br>hillsides of trees, to erode our topsoil, to leave exhausted<br>mining sites in a state of desolation, to fill the air with<br>noxious gases. It will cost the American taxpayer a pretty<br>penny to undo the damage; much of it can never be undone. Only<br>now are we beginning to realize that careless use of dangerous<br>pesticides and weed killers may poison soil, vegetation, animals<br>and humans. It took the tragic case of the European thalidomide<br>babies to dramatize the fatal consequences that may result if<br>inadequately tested drugs are sold to an unsuspecting public.</p>
<p>A third point that needs careful rethinking is how to offset</p>
<p>the loss of specifically American advantages that once served to</p>
<p>bolster individual freedom, consequently the democratic process.</p>
<p>We are only beginning to be aware of the diminishment or disappearance<br>of such blessings of good fortune as vast resources in unelaimed</p>
<p>land and natural wealth; scarcity of people; de facto equality of</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>mearly all citizens; the Simplicity of frontier life; geographic</p>
<p>isolation from the world&#x27;s trouble spots. When we had them we<br>came to take these favorable circumstances for granted; we did<br>not notice them disappearing one by one. Yet to the Founding<br>Fathers their importance for the success of democracy was</p>
<p>evident. They often Spoke of them. And they did not envisage</p>
<p>a time when we should no longer enjoy them.</p>
<p>Jefferson, for instance, believed that there would be<br>free sland for many generations to come and that we would remain<br>a country of independent farmers, artisans and merchants. He<br>had a horror of the propertyless masses of Europe&#x27;s crowded<br>cities and was outspoken in his conviction that these could<br>never be trusted to govern themselves. But Americans, beholden<br>to no master, would know how to exercise the duties of democratic<br>citizenship; possessing property themselves, they would manage<br>public affairs with sober skill. Political equality would be<br>insured because abundant land made for equality in wealth and<br>would prevent division into master and servant classes.</p>
<p>Well, nine out of ten Americans now work for others, many for giant<br>organizations where they have little opportunity to cultivate the virtues<br>Jefferson thought essential to the success of democratic government. We now<br>have a greater gap in wealth than other Western democracies. According to a</p>
<p>study by Robert J.Lampman the share in national wealth of the top 1% of our</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>gGuulstion amounts to 28 percent of the total, that of the poorest one tenth to<br>“a= ome percent--a difference of 280 to one,</p>
<p>For a century and a half we have had a population explosion the like of<br>which the world has never seen, From 1800 to 1850 we quintupled, from 1850 to<br>1900 we trebled, from 1900 to 1950 we doubled in numbers, natural growth having<br>as much to do with this population increase as immigration. Since World War II<br>the growth rate has accelerated so that when the time comes to celebrate our<br>bicentenary, each citizen will have but one percent of the voting power possessed<br>by Americans in our first national election, A healthy infant born on that day<br>can expect within his lifetime to see our population soar to the billion mark;<br>unless, of course, we ponder the consequences to the quality of American life<br>_and reverse the trend. |</p>
<p>Space of itself bestows freedom and dignity; it gives man elbow room and a<br>chance to find peace and quiet and privacy. When men are scarce each individual<br>becomes important. Well, today seven out of ten Americans live in crowded cities<br>and suburbs, and the country as a whole is more populous per square mile than was<br>Europe in Jefferson&#x27;s time, It is hard to find quiet and privacy and a spot of<br>unspoiled nature within reach of home, Man-made ugliness presses on ie human<br>spirit, and there is no ‘place = for ‘our children to play in safety.</p>
<p>As long as a wilderness had to be subdued there was work in abundance, work</p>
<p>of a kind that ordinary men with willing hearts and hands could do; vitally «<br>| needed work that bestowed dignity on. the workman, But today when our sockety is<br>plemed with endemic unemployment it is difficult to hold fast to a sense of |<br>human worth and importance. The loss falls most heavily on those--and alas there</p>
<p>are all too many--who lack the skill and education for which there is demand in 2</p>
<p>wmmplex modern society. In the past, America offered unique opportunities for<br>social advancement to average men with average competence; today this is less and<br>less true. America offered steady employment even to men of below average<br>ability, but job opportunities for them have contracted drastically, Ours is still<br>a land of opportunity, but increasingly so only for the highly skilled ai<br>educated,</p>
<p>With the disappearance of preindustrial, rural America we lost a way of life<br>that was congenial to individual ‘fréedom:and democracy, Life was simple,<br>Ordinary men could understand the world they lived in; they could manage their<br>affairs without much trouble; they could reach independent decisions on public<br>issues that concerned them as citizens of a democracy, Doubtless this accounts<br>for the great interest in public affairs that so astonished de Tocqueville<br>and on which he comments time and again. &quot;If an American were condemned to<br>confine his activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of his</p>
<p>existence,&quot; he wrote; and again: &quot;The interests of the country are everywhere</p>
<p>kept in view; they are an object of solicitude to the people of the whole</p>
<p>nation, and every citizen is as warmly attached to them as if they were his<br>own,&quot; |</p>
<p>The individual is diminished when he cannot comprehend the problems</p>
<p>‘besetting his nation, I, myself, think that if we had a first-rate school</p>
<p>system, concentrating on basic education in the liberal arts, many more Americans<br>than at present would understand and express their views on public issues,</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I keep hammering at the need for school reforn,</p>
<p>Let me say in passing that in several of the smaller European democracies,</p>
<p>which have exceptionally good public education, ordinary citizens do take</p>
<p>Wy</p>
<p>@ more active interest. in public affairs, I fear that if we do not exercise<br>war right of self-government, we may eventually lose it. |</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers were fully aware of the inestimable advantage our<br>geographic isolation gave us: we had a chance to develop this country without<br>fear of foreign invasion, without need of huge military establishments and of<br>compulsory military service. We used to think their absence was a special virtue<br>of the American way of life, Now we know they were a gift of Providence.<br>De Tocqueville noted that &quot;Fortune which has conferred so many peculiar benefits<br>upon the inhabitants of the United States has placed them in the midst of a<br>wilderness, where they have so-to-speak no neighbors.&quot; Well, this advantage,<br>too, has disappeared. We are in deadly peril and so we have to divert men,<br>money and effort into military preparedness. We now have the world&#x27;s biggest<br>military-industrial power complex. President Eisenhower warned us in his<br>Farewell Address that so great a concentration of power is potentially a danger<br>to democratic institutions. It certainly dwarfs the individual, both the men<br>who work in this complex and citizens in general. . |</p>
<p>Serious as is the loss of these natural advantages, it need not be fatal<br>to individual freedom or to preservation of a free society. Many of the most<br>civilized modern European countries never had our social advantages yet they<br>were able to evolve out of feudalism and capitalist monarchy into democratic<br>nations where individual freedom is at least as well, in some cases better</p>
<p>protected than here. What is needed is a new perspective: 4 recognition that<br>we must now take positive action to create &quot;artificially&quot; the climate in which<br>the autonomous individual and the free society can prosper. We still are</p>
<p>many times richer in land and natural wealth than other Western democracies</p>

<p>More serious in its effects upon individual freedon is another development<br>not foreseen by the Founding Fathers. This is the rise of giant organizations<br>which interpose themselves between the citizen and his government. When the<br>nation was founded we did not even have political parties; there were only<br>seven commercial corporations in all the colonies. We had no labor unions,<br>vocational or professional associations, special interest groups or huge<br>government bureaucracies. The citizen faced his government directly--whether<br>local, state or federal. With his fellow citizens he shared control over his<br>government on a basis of complete equality.</p>
<p>Today the citizen&#x27;s wishes may be thwarted if they conflict with the<br>interests of powerful organizations able to bring their immense resources to<br>bear on government. Organizations have on the whole been successful in<br>preventing governmental action they consider harmful to their interests, or<br>at least in delaying action or rendering it innocuous. They also have been<br>able to obtain special government benefits and privileges not vouchsaved<br>ordinary citizens. Their ability to diminish the government&#x27;s responsiveness<br>to the wishes of the unorganized individuals who make up the electorate is<br>indicative of great inequality of political power within the ‘constituency of our<br>democratic government; this is a contingency the Founding Fathers could not<br>have foreseen. When society is dominated by huge and powerful or, anizations,</p>
<p>the autonomy of the individual is diminished,</p>
<p>Of course, the right to associate with others for the purpose of engaging<br>in joint enterprises is itself an important part of individual freedom. In</p>
<p>a huge, populous, technically advanced country such as ours both private</p>
<p>gmc so we have a margin of safety giving us time to adjust to altered circumstances.</p>
<p>mi pablic organizations are indispensable. Enormous good flows from them.<br>They are what makes ours a pluralistic society in contrast to the monolithic<br>structure of authoritarian or totalitarian countries. Many organizations<br>are exclusively concerned with serving their members and do not seek to influence<br>anyone; others are small and therefore a threat to no one; not a few are<br>big and powerful but exemplary in behavior and performance. These do not<br>concern us here. What does concern us is the threat to individual freedom<br>posed by huge power complexes that dominate our lives but over which we are<br>not able to exercise control. Among them are public as well as private organizations.<br>Large government bureaucracies are as indispensable to modern society as<br>are large private organizations. Many government tasks have to be entrusted<br>to special agencies set up for this purpose. “Although they are a part of government,<br>the citizen&#x27;s influence over them is not as effective as it is on the elected<br>branches of government; nor are the men who run these bureaucracies as accessible<br>to citizens who have legitimate business with them as are elected government<br>| officials. Nevertheless the citizen can, in an imperfect way, exert some<br>control over public agencies. a<br>It is otherwise with large private organizations. These tend to develop<br>bureaucratic rigidity which limits the freedom of employees whose working and<br>sometimes private lives may be needlessly circumscribed; they also tend to<br>misuse their power in relations with the public and the government, as when<br>they seek to hold up necessary legislation favored by the electorate. Often<br>those &quot;faults of bigness,&quot; as one might call them, are not essential to the<br>purposes of the organization or even relevant to their specific tasks. Once</p>
<p>we recognize what makes large organization a danger to freedom, we can deal</p>
<p>17.</p>
<p>with the problem without interfering with their lawful pursuits.<br>fact, protection of individual freedoms will benefit organizations<br>since it releases private initiative which we all know is one of</p>
<p>the great powers for good inherent in a free society.</p>
<p>Organizations act through men. In our country, they act<br>through a special category of career men, called managers or<br>administrators, whose competence quite often lies exclusively<br>in the field of “administration&quot;; that is what they have been<br>trained for. There is a curious analogy between the educational<br>courses in administration, in leadership, in personnel management,</p>
<p>-etc., that make up the qualifications of the “pure&quot; administrator,<br>and the type of &quot;training for rulership&quot; that at one time used</p>
<p>to be given heirs to monarchical thrones. Mirabeau made the<br>perceptive remark that &quot;to administer...is to rule.&quot; ‘One might<br>expand this to say that administration is a type of authoritarian<br>rule with no constituency and no direct popular mandate. As</p>
<p>such it is an anomaly in a democratic society. I will return to<br>this point later.</p>
<p>In nearly ali our large organizations administration stands<br>apart and above production. The men who do the real work of the</p>
<p>organization are placed below the administrators who rule then.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Administrators May or may not have competence in the organization&#x27;s</p>
<p>Special field of work; often they do not. In fact, this is<br>considered so unimportant that “pure&quot; administrators are freely<br>moved from one type of organization to another. On the strength<br>of their &quot;ability to rule,&quot; administrators make all organization<br>decisions, and, if they so desire, are free to meddle with the<br>technical work of even the most highly qualified professionals in</p>
<p>the production end of the organization.</p>
<p>The concept of the &quot;pure,&quot; technically untrained administrator<br>as ruler of an organization is virtually unknown abroad. Take<br>education: clearly the teachers do all the productive work<br>but it is not they who manage the educational enterprise<br>in this country. Teachers are bossed by administrators who<br>quite often are not themselves teachers but whose training has<br>been exclusively in management of the school&#x27;s housekeeping,<br>personnel and public relations chores. We are the only country<br>that so debases the productive professional and SO exalts the</p>
<p>organization&#x27;s &quot;ruler.&quot;</p>
<p>The larger an organization, the more powerful are the managers<br>or administrators. Their source of power comes from being in charge</p>
<p>of housekeeping matters, hence of the purse and so in turn of personnel</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>selection and promotion. Also they are at the communications center of<br>the enterprise and know what is afoot. Since they represent the organization<br>in external relations, they partake of its &quot;image&quot; and power.</p>
<p>Like all rulers, administrators are more important and better paid the<br>larger their realm. Since they lack the distinction which productive<br>men--whether technicians, professionals, scholars, or for that matter,<br>artistic people--owe to their own personal competence, administrators<br>identify with their organization. This is natural since it is only from<br>control of the organization that they derive status. This makes them<br>empire builders. It also accounts for a-tendency to authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Orders flow downward freely, but suggestions rarely rise upward in the<br>hierarchy. Administrators also tend to be more interested in the<br>organization as such than in the quality of its work. Outstanding<br>achievements count for little if administrative routines have been<br>violated. Administrators prefer personnel they can manipulate to<br>mavericks whose initiative may produce some new process or attainment<br>of enormous benefit to the organization.</p>
<p>The individual who must work in a large organization--private or public--meets<br>conditions of inequality not found elsewhere in our democratic society. Nor is this<br>inequality necessarily a result of unequal human qualities; it comes because one<br>party has behind him the power of the organization and uses it to prevail over the<br>other. This reminds one uncomfortably of the special rights and privileges which<br>once were enjoyed by men for no other reason than membership in a higher estate-~</p>
<p>as when society was divided into the nobility, the clergy and the third estate.</p>
<p>Recently a number of books and articles have come out, describing life in</p>
<p>the giant corporation. If one may believe them, a man looking for a job or seeking<br>advancement would appear to have to submit to a degree of invasion of privacy</p>
<p>that strikes me as intolerable, besides being quite unnecessary. No fifth<br>amendment protects certain categories of job seekers against being subjected</p>
<p>to personality tests of dubious scientific value which probe their soul and</p>
<p>inquire into their family life, churchgoing habits, and whether they have or do</p>
<p>not have an interest in cultural matters. Several Fortune: articles describe</p>
<p>the most extraordinary corporate &quot;sumptuary rules,&quot; reminiscent of the Middle</p>
<p>Ages, which prescribe the type of house, car, club, and even wife an aubitious</p>
<p>“organization” man is well advised to heed. Occasionally, he may even find it<br>advisable to reshape his personality to conform to the &quot;image&quot; the corporation<br>has of its management--the image being usually that of incumbent top personnel.<br>And since his social life is considered part of his corporate life, he will have<br>to drop old friends if they fall behind him in his upward march in the organization.<br>Of course, the corporation will move him around the country every few years, hence<br>neither he nor his family can put down roots. |</p>
<p>Corporations are by no means the only organizations run by autocratic managers<br>with an itch to meddle in the private lives of employees. Labor unions and<br>professional organizations as well as other special interest groups have been<br>known to offend in similar ways. The results have been harmful to the individual<br>and to society.</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers sought to &quot;secure&quot; the “unalienable rights&quot; of man by<br>associating the citizen with the business of governing; that is, by making the</p>
<p>consent of the people indispensable to the functioning of government. In order</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>:<br>|<br>;</p>
<p>to exercise his public functions a citizen must be free to make up his own mind<br>on any public issue, to speak out and to solicit the approval of his fellow<br>citizens; in other words, to be active politically. Freedom in private life is<br>important, for the citizen needs what Socrates called &quot;a private station,&quot; when<br>he engages in public activities. More than invasions of privacy, intolerable |<br>in a free society, are therefore involved when organizations presume to meddle<br>in their employees’. personal lives. Can a man who must submit to organizational</p>
<p>regimentation be a fully effective democratic citizen? Will he feel free to</p>
<p>‘engage in active politics if there is doubt in his mind whether the organization</p>
<p>he works for approves?</p>
<p>Another point needs to be considered: The citizen can form no autonomous<br>judgment on public issues unless he has access to relevant infomation permitting<br>him to verify the facts and evaluate the merits of the case. Large organizations--<br>private and public--nowadays engage the services of highly trained public relations<br>staffs whose job it is to project to the public as favorable an &quot;image&quot; of the<br>organization as possible, and to hide its defects behind a screen of persuasive<br>propaganda. To hold the reins of self-government, the citizen must be able to<br>penetrate this screen and get at the truth. He has but two means at hand: one,<br>the press, the other, the individual critic.</p>
<p>The importance of a free press cannot be overstated; it is absolutely ..<br>essential to the democratic process. An alert press mistrusts public relations<br>handouts and tries to get at the truth. But given their financial dependence on<br>advertisements, the mass media are under pressure to play down unpleasant facts.<br>More important, criticism is not always &quot;newsworthy.&quot; It may not hecone newsworthy</p>
<p>until individual critics have sparked public interest--as happened with education</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>in this country. Once there is public interest, the press takes a hand and helps<br>to get something accomplished,</p>
<p>The people must know &quot;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&quot;<br>on any issue and about any Organization&#x27;’s performance whenever the public interest<br>is involved. There is need for &quot;critics by profession&quot;~-conmentators, columnists,<br>etc., whose &quot;beat&quot; is the whole of the Social scene--but there is also need of<br>&quot;lay critics&quot; who look upon discovery and publication of truth as part of their<br>Civic responsibility. Even as we have need of volunteers whose charity is personal</p>
<p>alongside professional welfare workers who are paid to look after those in need</p>
<p>able to count the people on his Side. But, all too often, habits of conformity<br>and mistrust of iconoclasts lead the public to take a neutral position, as if<br>they were judging an &quot;adversary proceeding&quot; in a court of law. I+ is a sad<br>comment on the decline of individualism in America that the critic has no friend<br>at court. He is tagged &quot;controversial,&quot; the worst that can happen to anyone in<br>a conformist society. This makes him by definition a &quot;flawed&quot; personality, non-<br>group adjusted, one-sided, ill-informed, frustrated, and motivated by i11 will,<br>Epithets may therefore be thrown at him with impunity; he may be misquoted and<br>misrepresented, and what he Says may be contemptiously dismissed as requiring<br>no refutation,</p>
<p>I believe the public dislikes critics because it confuses two quite different</p>
<p>kinds of criticism: Meddling in private affairs and concern with public issues.</p>
<p>and force unbidden advice on us are obnoxious and not to be tolerated. But giant</p>
<p>organizations cannot preempt large slices of life as their private preserve--in<br>analogy to the citizen&#x27;s private life--and call anyone who inquires into what<br>Concerns the public a meddler in matters &quot;that are none of his business,&quot;<br>George Kennan tells a story of czarist Russia that illustrates my point.</p>
<p>The czars used to get rid of critics by sending them into Siberian exile.<br>This was done without court procedure by a special administration notorious<br>for corruption and inefficiency. For respectfully petitioning Czar Alexander Ill,<br>and imploring him to right a glaring miscarriage of justice--the wrong man having<br>been sent into exile--a Russian lady was herself exiled forthwith. The Czar<br>remarked contemptuously, &quot;hat business is it of hers?&quot;</p>
<p>Many people have been concerned over the danger of our becoming a pressure<br>group state. It has been proposed that the people be given a special department<br>to look after their interests. This misreads the problem. The government in<br>all its branches is set up to look after the people&#x27;s interests. To quote Madison,<br>it &quot;derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people,<br>and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a<br>limited period, or during good behaviour.&quot; |</p>
<p>What we must do, I submit, is find ways to pressive the autonomy of citizens<br>who work for large organizations as well as of those whose lives sre affected by<br>activities of these organizations. Government bureaucracies should be made more<br>responsive to the wishes of the voters; this means bringing them under closer<br>control of our elective bodies, Private organizations ought to be held more<br>strictly to the Specific mandate of their corporate charters, as well as to</p>
<p>&quot;public policy.&quot; Let me explain.</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>Nearly all large private organisms owe their existence to corporate charters;<br>they are creatures of the law, set up for specific purposes, and, to quote the<br>Encyclopedia Brittanica, &quot;restricted to actions concerned in furthering these<br>purposes.&quot; Unlike natural persons who may do anything not forbidden by law, these<br>synthetic persons may do only what the law expressly authorizes them to do.<br>&quot;Actions outside that field are ultra vires and can be restrained and declared<br>void,&quot; The distinction is important for in actual fact it is nearly always<br>ultra vires acts of organizations that adversely affect individual freedom. This<br>is as true of so-called “membership corporations&quot; as of &quot;stock corporations.&quot;</p>
<p>Incorporated organizations are in contemplation of and by force of law<br>deemed to be &quot;persons.&quot; The courts for all practical purposes grant them full</p>
<p>rights of federal citizenship. But’need this mean that their freedom should be</p>
<p>larger than the freedom of natural citizens, except insofar as the corporate</p>
<p>Charter gives them immortality and limited financial liability? Furthermore,<br>the law restrains activities of natural persons when these are contrary to<br>“public policy.&quot; It was on this basis, for example, that Utah was not admitted<br>to statehood until it prohibited polygamy. Should not in analogous fashion the<br>bay restrain activities of corporate persons when these are contrary to &quot;public<br>policy?&quot; For instance when ovkcigations diminish the autonomy of American<br>citizens or their influence on the government,</p>
<p>We have allowed the freedom of the individual to shrink while permitting<br>the freedom of the organization to expand to a point where it overshadows human<br>liberties. But this nation was founded for people, not for organizations, We<br>need to remind ourselves that organizations--like technology--are not ends in</p>
<p>themselves but means to an end. This end is a good society; a strong nations</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>human beings who in equal measure are assured the right to &quot;life, liberty and the<br>pursuit of happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>I have no simple solutions to offer. There are no Simple solutions for any<br>of the problems which urgently require our attention today. We can approach these<br>problems from many different angles. I approach them from the point of view that<br>individual freedom must be preserved. Fortunately, there are Signs that give one<br>hope we have passed the nadir and are slowly ascending toward the more rugged<br>individualism that was so marked a characteristic of earlier Americans. The<br>shock Sputnik administered to our self-esteem has led us to throw: ourselves<br>into an earnest search for flaws in our way of life. In speaking to you I am<br>motivated by the firm conviction that once the American people have been shown<br>at what points individual freedom has been weakened, they will speedily Pein force!<br>them.</p>
<p>They will be able to do this all the better if a general tendency is<br>overcome to think of ourselves as more unique than we actually are. A good<br>one of not wholly disinterested propaganda comes our way, seeking to convince<br>us that all the good things of life we assadiate with American democracy are</p>
<p>uniquely ours or, at least, originated here, There was a time when life in this</p>
<p>country differed greatly from life in other Western nations. For over one ‘hundred<br>years we were the model of the free society. But ideas have bean moving back and<br>forth across the Atlantic, leaving deposits on both shores, Democracy as a form<br>of goverment has long since become the Western--not solely the American--way of<br>life. It is well also to remember that its roots g0 back 2,500 years to Greece.<br>And that in evolving the concept of the equal worth of all men every Western</p>
<p>nation has played a part. The greatest glory of Western civilization is that it</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>‘alone, on its own’, came to accept the idea that man, as man, individual man ,<br>regardless of his particular attributes or possessions is “the measure of all<br>things&quot; (Protagoras) Since the political corollary of this idea is democratic<br>‘government, it is not surprising that democracy, too, is a uniquely Western<br>invention.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, all successful democracies are today to be found in<br>the West. All face Similar problems. All seek to solve them through the democratic<br>process. Each can learn something from the others without being untrue to<br>itself. There is, I believe, an irresistible trend toward changing government<br>from the &quot;night watchman&quot; to the &quot;service agency&quot; type. Something could be<br>learned from the way this transition is being made -in the most successful of<br>European democracies. Their reasons have been practical, not ideological, and the<br>process of transformation has been democratic. What has been recognized and<br>accepted abroad is that modern life is now so coupler, so dependent on careful<br>dovetailing of innumerable human activities, that the individual is in need of<br>greater protection by the law against being harmed by fellow citizens. There can<br>be no valid objection in principle against making necessary changes. The<br>Declaration of Independence states, &quot;it is the right of the People&quot; so to alter<br>the powers of government &quot;as to them shall seem most likely to effect their<br>Safety and! Happiawes..&quot; |</p>
<p>A friendly though critical visitor to our country once remarked that &quot;there is<br>nothing wrong with haben that Americans cannot set right.&quot; We can, if we will,<br>strenethien the autonomous individual in our free society. In so doing we will make<br>our nation a better, more humane place to live; a stronger, more flexible, more</p>
<p>influential nation.</p>
