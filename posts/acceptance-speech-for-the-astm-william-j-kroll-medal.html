      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s 1975 speech, &quot;The Decision to Use Zirconium in Nuclear Reactors,&quot; delivered at the William J. Kroll Medal Presentation, details the pivotal choice and immense engineering challenges involved in adopting zirconium for naval nuclear propulsion. Rickover honors Dr. William J. Kroll, emphasizing his crucial role in developing the zirconium production process at the Bureau of Mines. The speech highlights the 1947 breakthrough by Dr. Kaufman (MIT) and Dr. Pomerance (Oak Ridge), who discovered that the high neutron absorption of natural zirconium was due to hafnium impurities (about 2% by weight), leading Rickover to swiftly decide on its use despite its initial high cost ($300/pound in 1945) and limited availability. He recounts the subsequent hurdles, including the complex production using the crystal-bar process, the development of the Zircaloy-1 alloy, and bureaucratic conflicts with the Atomic Energy Commission over procurement, ultimately leading to his organization producing 85% of the metal for the successful Mark I reactor, which achieved criticality on March 30, 1953. Rickover stresses the distinction between scientific discovery and engineering implementation, advocating for individual effort over large organizations and the critical importance of practical facts and &quot;details,&quot; famously stating, &quot;The Devil is in the details, but so is salvation.&quot;</p>

        <p>Below is the full text of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover's speech titled &quot;The Decision to Use Zirconium in Nuclear Reactors&quot; from the 1975 Rickover Paper on Zirconium:</p>
<p>| am honored to be the first recipient of the William J. Kroll Medal for Zirconium. It is gratifying for me because it gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to an outstanding scientist.</p>
<p>| came to recognize his extraordinary qualities in the late 1940s and early 1950s. At that time, nuclear propulsion for naval ships was far from a reality. Those of us working on the project faced problems at every hand. One of the most crucial was the development of a production process to obtain zirconium once the material was chosen for use in the nuclear reactor. We did not know whether the metal could be produced in sufficient quantities or to the rigid specifications needed for naval reactors.</p>
<p>Dr. Kroll had worked on the development of a zirconium production process at the Bureau of Mines facility at Albany, Oregon. | made several hurried trips to see the work being done in that facility to furnish zirconium for the first naval reactors. Usually, Dr. Kroll—then a consultant to the Bureau of Mines—and several senior officials of the Bureau met me at the Portland airport on Friday evenings. We would drive to Albany, inspect the equipment, and discuss the results of the production effort then underway. Dr. Kroll always gave me straightforward answers. He was a scientist. |am an engineer. Our common interest was zirconium. | think we both understood the problems the other faced. | believe we had this understanding because we based our discussion on principles.</p>
<p>Dr. Kroll was convinced that great advances in science came through the efforts of individuals. He himself exemplified this philosophy. As he wrote in 1955, his early work on zirconium was conducted at his laboratory in Luxembourg, where his only assistants were an unskilled laborer, a mechanic, and a secretary. | also have found in my 57 years of naval service that engineering problems are most often solved through the efforts of technically competent individuals, not through the establishment of huge organizations or management systems.</p>
<p>Tonight | will talk about the decision to use zirconium and the principles that lay behind that decision. Circumstances change; events never repeat themselves exactly, but principles are long enduring. Much of what | shall say will be my personal recollections. | recognize, however, that without the zeal and hard work of scores of engineers and scientists from several</p>
<p>organizations, zirconium would not be—as it is today—the major structural material in naval reactors and in nearly all of the reactors in central station power plants in the United States.</p>
<p>A nuclear reactor is not a laboratory instrument. It is a piece of engineering equipment. When we were first assigned the job of building a reactor for a nuclear submarine, we had to develop a device that would work reliably and safely in the hands of operating forces. It had to function when the ship was moving, when the ship was at an angle diving or surfacing. It had to be safe and reliable. It had to be rugged to meet military demands. Finally, it would have to be operated by young sailors—men who were not scientists or engineers but who would be carefully trained.</p>
<p>These are engineering problems. At Oak Ridge, we were dazzled by the virtuosity of the scientists. They had accomplished much during the war. We soon discovered that scientists could give us only limited help. The goal of the scientist is to discover the laws of nature. The engineer uses and must obey those laws. The difference is fundamental. Theoretical concepts are crucial to science, but they can have a dangerous and hypnotic effect on individuals who are responsible for practical results. The engineer must seek out technical facts. He cannot run away from them.</p>
<p>The decision to use zirconium in a nuclear reactor is an example of engineering judgment. During 1946 and 1947, several groups of scientists and engineers were investigating metals for use in reactors. Zirconium was one such metal. Stainless steel, aluminum, and beryllium were others. The search was further complicated because several different types of reactors were under study. One of the most promising of these approaches for naval propulsion was the pressurized water reactor. However, for this application, a structural metal was needed which would withstand corrosion at high temperatures for long periods of time, which would maintain its integrity in an environment of intense radiation, and which would not absorb neutrons needed for the nuclear reaction. Furthermore, if the Navy was to have a fleet of nuclear ships, the metal had to be one which could be produced in quantity and at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Zirconium, too, did not look promising. Although its corrosion properties appeared reasonable, it was expensive and had never been produced in quantity. In 1945, only a few hundred pounds were manufactured in the United States. The cost was over $300 per pound. Above all, tests showed that zirconium absorbed neutrons needed for the fission process.</p>
<p>This situation changed suddenly. While visiting Oak Ridge in December 1947, | learned that Dr. Kaufman of MIT and Dr. Pomerance of Oak Ridge had just found that zirconium, as occurring in nature, was combined with the element hafnium. It was the hafnium—at about 2 percent by weight—which gave the zirconium the high level of neutron absorption. They were able to remove the hafnium in the laboratory and obtain zirconium which absorbed only a few neutrons. This was a scientific fact of great importance. At once | decided to choose zirconium for the naval reactor.</p>
<p>But the engineering problems were immense. At the time of this decision there was no assured source of zirconium, no estimate of how much would be needed, no certainty that any known or conceivable process could produce the required amount, and no specifications for the nuclear,</p>
<p>mechanical, or corrosion qualities the metal had to possess. It was also possible that removing the hafnium could destroy the other qualities that had made zirconium worth investigating in the first place.</p>
<p>The decision was a logical choice for the pressurized water propulsion reactor. It was a risk, but all development is a risk. Once the decision was made we did everything we could to reduce the uncertainty. We did so by trying to find out what were the natural phenomena—which is only another way of saying that we were searching for technical facts. This is the responsibility of engineering—its challenge—and its ethical content.</p>
<p>Several organizations helped us by running tests and performing analyses. This sounds simple, but it took us time to work out standards so that the efforts of one group could be compared with those of others. As research was going on to ascertain the engineering properties of zirconium, Dr. Kroll was continuing his work to improve the processes used to manufacture zirconium at low cost.</p>
<p>Soon we came up against a hard fact. The Bettis Laboratory needed zirconium. Procuring the metal was the responsibility of another organization of the Atomic Energy Commission. The indication was that the Commission, by following its procedures, could not procure zirconium on the schedule and in the quantity needed. | urged the Commission to authorize Bettis to manufacture zirconium for the Idaho reactor. The Commission overrode my recommendation.</p>
<p>| objected strenuously. | had been assigned the job of developing a nuclear submarine. The schedule called for having the ship ready for operation by January 1955—less than five years away. Zirconium at this moment was crucial in the development of the reactor. Further, this project was the only one committed to zirconium. The Commission was violating the principle that authority must match responsibility. | had been assigned the task, knew the facts, but other people were determining how my requirements should be met.</p>
<p>Certain factors were involved in the crisis. First, production application of the Kroll process was still under development and had not yet produced fully satisfactory metal. Therefore, we had to use the crystal-bar process which, at best, produced material of varying quality. In this technique bars were formed by deposition of a volatile zirconium compound on a heated filament. The individual bars were small and expensive. The Commission took the position that | should wait until a less costly process was available.</p>
<p>The Commission plan to procure the zirconium from a commercial company failed. As a result, Bettis in July 1950, was finally authorized to build a crystal-bar plant. Several organizations and facilities took part in supplying the zirconium needed for processing at Bettis. In August, the Commission transferred the authority to procure zirconium to my own organization. About 85 percent of the metal used for the Mark | reactor was made at Bettis. The rest came from industry sources. The successful operation of the Mark |, which achieved criticality on March 30, 1953, and reached full power on June 25, 1953, vindicated many technical decisions, among them the use of zirconium.</p>
<p>There still remained the job of developing a zirconium alloy which would be cheaper to produce and would have less variability in corrosion resistance. In this process the Kroll technique would be the final production step and eliminate the need for the crystal-bar step, an important factor in reducing costs. Test programs at Bettis and elsewhere examined the effects of adding various elements to zirconium. Tin proved most beneficial. A committee composed of men from several organizations, who had actually worked on zirconium development, recommended an alloy, later called Zircaloy-1, having 2.5 percent tin for the Nautilus reactor.</p>
<p>To say that it is necessary to obtain facts is little more useful than offering a soothing platitude. In engineering development, as well as in other fields, finding facts is arduous, exhausting, and time-consuming. They do not exist in isolation. The Romans looked at a constellation in the sky and called it Ursa Major. We call it the Big Dipper. The stars are the same, but we are different from the Romans. So it is with data: the use depends on your goal and your view.</p>
<p>The scientist can follow his quest in pursuit of knowledge; he can, to use popular figures of speech, explore an endless frontier or a boundless horizon. An engineer cannot. He has different responsibilities. He must proceed from one point to another. But even this is drastic oversimplification. The relations between means and the end are dynamic—a change at one point affects others.</p>
<p>It is this fluidity that places a particular responsibility upon the individual in charge of a development project. He cannot separate himself from technical work. He must not allow himself to be isolated by layers of administrators and managers. In Greek mythology, Antaeus was a giant who was strong as long as he had contact with the earth. When he was lifted from the earth he lost his strength. So it is with engineers. They must not be isolated from the real world.</p>
<p>When Dr. Kroll and | met at Albany, we dealt with details. We had to. We understood each other because we based our discussion on principles—his were scientific, mine were engineering. Far too frequently people, particularly those who have just come from universities, are convinced that if they learn the principles, that is all they need to know. As the decision on zirconium shows, this is not so. Of course you need principles, but that is not enough.</p>
<p>The Devil is in the details, but so is salvation.</p>
