      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address, Vice Admiral H.G. Rickover argues passionately for a fundamental reform of American education, asserting it &quot;isn&#x27;t good enough&quot; to meet the demands of a complex, competitive world. He contrasts the U.S. school system, which he characterizes by its short school year, wasted hours on &quot;trivia,&quot; and lack of rigorous teacher qualifications, with those of other advanced nations like Europe and Russia. Rickover proposes the establishment of a National Standards Committee to formulate and certify scholastic standards through examinations, akin to English national exams, to foster excellence and combat complacency, citing the &quot;painful shocks&quot; like Sputnik. He references Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s observation on America becoming &quot;crowded,&quot; Dorothy Thompson&#x27;s view on &quot;Democracy,&quot; a 1959 Ford Foundation report on education&#x27;s indispensability, and his testimony to Chairman Clarence Cannon of the House Appropriations Committee, also mentioning the 1956 Water Pollution Act as a precedent for permissive national standards.</p>

        <p>LET&#x27;S. REALLY EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>H. G@. Rickover<br>Vice Admiral, USN</p>
<p>&quot;Professional&quot; educators often accuse me of wanting to foist a foreign<br>school system on our children. Some are going about the country claiming<br>I intend to &quot;militarize&quot; education. Evidently none have ever read what</p>
<p>I have been saying. My argument is that, whether we look at American</p>
<p>education from the point of view of the kind of educated youth we need<br>in our complex society, or from the point of view of our competitive<br>position in education vis-a-vis other advanced nations, the answer is the<br>same: It just isn&#x27;t good enough. &#x27; .</p>
<p>Any ‘sensible person recognizing the need for improvement would look</p>
<p>into the ways other democratic nations go about educating their children.</p>
<p>The time is past when we were in the uniquely favorable circumstance of<br>being able to get along with Schools that were markedly inferior to —<br>those of countries with which we were competing economically or politically</p>
<p>or both. Nor do we now have the immense wealth in land and resources that</p>
<p>in the past offset our educational deficiencies. Woodrow Wilson observed<br>half a century ago, &quot;the stage of America grows crowded like the</p>
<p>stage of Europe. The life of the new world grows as complex as the life<br>of the old.&quot; Since then we have doubled our population and made deep</p>
<p>inroads. in our stock of nonrenewabile resources. The conditions of life</p>

<p>in this country daily approach closer to those of the older nations of<br>Europe. Of course, we are still a rich country; our resources still<br>exceed those of Europe and perhaps even of Russia; but we can no longer<br>afford to wasté time and money on an inadequate school system.</p>
<p>What then is to be done to improve American education? Well, local<br>communities and state governments have the power to increase the amount |<br>of classroom instruction per school year. We have the shortest school<br>day and school year among leading nations. They could eliminate from<br>curricula everything that can be learned elsewhere. We are the only<br>advanced country where precious school hours are wasted teaching children<br>how to make fudge, twirl batons, drive cars, budget income, handle the<br>telephone, catch fish, and similar trivia that any reasonably normal<br>person picks up on his own or learns at home. Most important of all,<br>they could improve teacher qualifications, bringing them up to the |<br>level. existing abroad, and they could then put the educational enterprise<br>under the supervision of our best teachers, giving them the necessary<br>clerical’.and administrative assistance. Abroad,where teaching is an<br>honored profession, no one would dream of putting nonteacher administrators<br>in charge of schools. We are the only country where teachers are bossed<br>by educational administrators. who often as not can lay no claim to<br>scholarship, superior intelligence or higher education, and who may not<br>have had experience in classroom teaching.</p>
<p>All this is important but I am convinced that we cannot . put through<br>a really effective reform program unless we set up a national scholastic</p>
<p>standard--a permissive standard, of course--but nevertheless potentially</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>a great influence for good. Many countries have, at one time or another,<br>discovered their educational systems to be unsatisfactory. I know of<br>none that has. been able to carry out speedy reform without making use<br>of some such standard. Indeed we are the only advanced nation without -<br>a national scholastic standard.</p>
<p>Now the word &quot;standard&quot; has many connotations. I use it in the sens<br>that comes first to mind: a specific requirement or level of excellence<br>deemed worthy of esteem or reward. Not a law, enforceable in the</p>
<p>courts; falling below standard does not put one in jail. Nor a conventior</p>
<p>‘ule imposed by society; failure to meet the standard does not get one</p>
<p>socially ostracized. No one has to live up to the standard. It is simpl}</p>
<p>‘an optional criterion for determining the value of an act or accomplishmer</p>
<p>For those who accept the standard it becomes the yardstick by which the<br>worth of these acts or accomplishments is determined. |</p>
<p>I do not share the pride our educationists take in the fact that<br>we are the only leading nation with a school system that does not challens<br>its children to meet a national scholastic standard in order to receive<br>academic rewards. I do not agree with them that children must not be<br>&quot;judged;&quot; that each child has a right to &quot;equal education and equal<br>status;&quot; hence that, as one superintendent of schools put it, &quot;straight<br>thinking and democratically minded school administrators&quot; will hand out.<br>the same diploma, &quot;regardless of the variation of high school courses and<br>the range of scholastic achievement that are presented by the graduates<br>as evidence of accomplishment.&quot; ‘I think this educator misreads the whole</p>
<p>purpose of academic certificates when he notes with approval that: &quot;No</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>longer does the diploma in its wording discriminate among the graduates,<br>as was once the case when it carried the name of the course in which<br>the student vent through school, consequently implying that the<br>accomplishments of the youth who did not take the highly academic lane<br>were less worthy.’ ;</p>
<p>Nor do I share educationist concern that children who do not measure<br>up to a standard will suffer pain and lose face. I suggest we set up a<br>standard for different levels of aptitude, but in each case representing<br>not the &#x27; &#x27;average” accomplishment but the &quot;highest&quot; level children of this<br>ability can with effort achieve. . _</p>
<p>All of life is a series of tests. Young people will be better able<br>to take these tests in their stride if at an early age they begin to learn<br>that everything worthwhile requires great effort but that the satisfaction<br>derived from attaining 4 standard makes effort worthwhile. Given the wide<br>differences of aptitude with which we are born and which we do not know</p>
<p>how to alter, is it not good for young children to discover that some</p>
<p>goals are beyond their capacities; that they cannot win all the tests? | .</p>
<p>Is it not better to know one&#x27;s limitations, as well as one&#x27;s capacities;<br>not to live in delusions which life sooner or later will rudely shatter?</p>
<p>Every American wants the best for our children. In education the<br>best we can give them is the chance to stretch their minds and reach the</p>
<p>highest goal their intellect can encompass. &quot;Democracy, &quot; wrote the late</p>
<p>Dorothy Thompson, &quot;4s not to be conceived of as an invitation to share</p>
<p>a common mediocrity, but a system that allows each to express and live</p>
<p>up to the special, excellence that is in him.&quot;</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Last May, in testimony on English education before the House<br>Appropriations Committee, Chairman Clarence Cannon asked me by what means<br>I thought Congress might help to speed educational progress. I suggested<br>that a National Standards Committee be created. | This would be a&amp; small<br>Committee composed of men of national stature and eminence--trustworthy,<br>intelligent, scholarly and devoted to the ideal of an American education<br>second to none. ‘The Committee would have two tasks:</p>
<p>The first would be purely informational; it would act as an educationa<br>watchtower announcing danger when it Saw it approaching. The members.<br>would keep under continuous scrutiny, and periodically report on the<br>state of American education. Does it meet the needs of our times? Is it<br>competitive with education in countries at similar levels of culture and<br>technology with whom we compete economically, politically, or militarily?<br>How do American children compare in academic knowledge with children: in<br>Europe or Russia, say at age 12, or 16, or 18; taking, of course, into<br>consideration different ability levels? ;</p>
<p>The Committee&#x27;s Second task would be to formulate a national scholastic<br>standard on the basis of its findings; &amp;@ standard which would make us<br>internationally competitive and would aiso respond to our specific domestic<br>needs. The Committee would do this by means of examinations set at<br>different ability levels. No one would have to take them, but those who</p>
<p>passed would receive national accreditation. The Committee would in no</p>
<p>way interfere with established institutions now granting diplomas or<br>degrees. It would simply set up a higher standard, offer it to anyone</p>
<p>-who wished to meet it, and certify those who had successfully done so.</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>Neither the Committee&#x27;s informational nor its standard setting<br>function would represent a radical departure from established practice.<br>Many federal agencies collect and distribute information, We need a<br>disinterested agency to tell us the unvarnished truth about the true state<br>of American education. The Committee would help prevent complacency and<br>illusions of superiority and thus save us from the kind of Painful shocks<br>that Sputnik and other evidence of Russian scientific proficiency have<br>given us in the past few years. There is precedent, too, for the<br>Committee&#x27;s setting of permissive national standards. We have something<br>very like it in last year’s amendment to the 1956 Water Pollution Act.</p>
<p>This amendment authorizes the federal government--1f so requested by<br>&#x27; &amp; State--to research and develop new methods of pollution control and to<br>award grants-in-aid to localities and states wishing to use these<br>federally established methods. In principle, you have here &amp; national<br>standard very much like the scholastic standard of the proposed Committee,<br>in that it 1s not imposed but merely offered as @ service on a take it</p>
<p>or leave it basis. | |</p>
<p>In both cases, we face a problem that cannot be solved by local and.<br>state authorities alone but requires some assistance from the federal<br>government. Population growth threatens us with @ severe water shortage<br>unless we devise better means to preserve the quality of our water resources<br>so that they may be used over and over again. Pollution abatement has<br>therefore become a national Problem and we accept anew kind of federal<br>aid. I believe improvement of the. quality of American education is at</p>
<p>least as pressing as the need for an assured supply of clean water.</p>
<p>6 a</p>
<p>“gaucation, &quot; says the Ford Foundation report for 1959; ™s now the<br>andispensable medium for survival and progress. &quot; Education 4g so basic to<br>the quality of our national life that by steering 4t in the right direction<br>we can change America&#x27;s future; we can make it secure. To steer it right,<br>I believe we need a new kind of federal aia--the Kind of aid that the |<br>proposed National Standards Committee would offer. oo</p>
<p>Let ‘me make 4t erystal clear that nothing in my proposal would violate<br>che constitutional separation of power petween federal and state<br>government 5 ; nor g0 counter to our tradition of control of schools by</p>
<p>the local community . r envisage the rendering of a service, not regulation</p>
<p>in any way» shape Or manner. The proposed Committee would not usurp</p>
<p>the functions of any existing institution.</p>
<p>Its job would be to draw uP national examinations going deeply into<br>a candidate&#x27;s true knowledge and sntellectual caliber--not TBM graded<br>multiple choice tests. I suggested to the appropriations Committee</p>
<p>that we might well model them on the English national examinations which<br>come at three levels and which offer many subject tests. Students choose<br>the number of subjects and the level at which they wish to be examined. :<br>is marked on their certificate which will list their so-called &quot;passes.&quot;</p>
<p>; The Committee might provide © one set of examinations at the level<br>appropriate for a high school graduate who aspires to enter @ first-rate<br>college; another set of examinations at the level of students who may<br>wish to prepare for a semiprofessional or technician&#x27;s job not requiring</p>
<p>pachelor degree put still requiring a good high school education. ‘still</p>
<p>another for gradua ates of various types of colleges; especially those</p>
<p>| 7</p>
<p>bound for the teaching profession. I stress again that no one would</p>
<p>meed to take these examinations; but those who did pass them successfully<br>would obtain national certification; perhaps the notation N. g, --National<br>Scholar --stamped on their regular diplomas or degrees. The seal would<br>clearly indicate what the holder had achieved. There are many occasions ©<br>when admissions officers of higher educational institutions or<br>prospective employers have &amp; valid reason for wanting to know what an<br>applicant&#x27;s scholastic qualifications actually are. Think how much time<br>and money would be saved if the diploma were clearly to indicate this!</p>
<p>Everywhere abroad it is taken for granted that academic degrees conform to</p>
<p>specific standard--a standard known to everyone. Setting the standard is</p>
<p>not regarded as government 4ntrusion or tyranny but as a welcome service</p>
<p>to students, their parents and the taxpayers who pay for public education.</p>
<p>Everyone penefits when there is a standard. At one stroke it does<br>away with misleading educational labels 50 that any layman has the means<br>to judge whether @ school or college is doing its job properly. By<br>offering the reward of a certified diploma to our children many who now<br>drift through school would be encouraged to aspire to higher academic<br>goals. |</p>
<p>In his “introduction to the Hearings before the Committee on<br>Appropriations, Chairman Cannon wrote that this &quot;committee hopes the<br>Admiral&#x27;s remarks will stimulate a national debate on She question of</p>
<p>whether there shall be set up an agency of some kind to provide permissive</p>
<p>national standards by way of national examinations leading to national</p>
<p>acereditation of diplomas and degrees.&quot; Those who are interested in this</p>
