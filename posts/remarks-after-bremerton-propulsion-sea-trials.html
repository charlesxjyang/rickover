      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This memo from December 1, 1980, details Admiral Rickover&#x27;s post-sea trial remarks for the Bremerton propulsion plant, emphasizing the paramount importance of quality and proper construction in submarines. Rickover asserts that &quot;first-class quality&quot; must always be the &quot;prime consideration,&quot; overriding concerns for lower cost or speedy construction, a principle he highlights by citing historical company orders from Electric Boat Company presidents L.Y. Spear (1945) and J.W. Jones (1965). He expresses concern that modern shipbuilding conglomerates often prioritize profit over quality, warning that &quot;transient management&quot; may lead to &quot;the loss of a submarine.&quot; The Admiral concludes by underscoring the intrinsic value of quality and integrity, referencing Matthew 6:21 (&quot;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also&quot;) and sharing an anecdote about the difficulty two &quot;experts&quot; had in locating this particular Bible verse.</p>

<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER&#x27;S REMARKS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE BREMERTON PROPULSION<br>EE RERUN ERUPULOLON<br>SEA TRIALS</p>
<p>CAPTAIN ANDERSON: THIS IS THE CAPTAIN SPEAKING. ADMIRAL RICKOVER HAS<br>SOME REMARKS FOR THE CREW AND THOSE EMBARKED.</p>
<p>ADMIRAL RICKOVER: WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST TRIALS OF THE BREMERTON.<br>THE PROPULSION PLANT OPERATED SATISFACTORILY.</p>
<p>I RECOGNIZE THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF ELECTRIC BOAT HAS BEEN IMPATIENT TO<br>GET THIS SHIP TO SEA. BUT IN SUBMARINES, THERE IS NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE<br>TO HAVING THE SHIP BUILT PROPERLY.</p>
<p>A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE ELECTRIC BOAT COMPANY, MR. L.Y. SPEAR, UNDER-<br>STOOD THE NECESSITY OF HAVING HIGH QUALITY WORK IN SUBMARINES. ON JUNE</p>
<p>26, 1945, MR. SPEAR ISSUED ELECTRIC BOAT COMPANY ORDER NO. 13. THIS ORDER<br>WAS A RESTATEMENT OF COMPANY POLICY PUBLISHED AS ORDER NO. 4 DATED<br>SEPTEMBER 1, 1932. IT WAS PUBLISHED BY THE NEW LONDON SHIP AND ENGINE WORKS.<br>ON NOVEMBER 17, 1965, ANOTHER FORMER ELECTRIC BOAT PRESIDENT, MR. J.W.<br>JONES, REISSUED MR. SPEAR&#x27;S ORDER TO ELECTRIC BOAT EMPLOYEES. THE ORDER<br>INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>&quot;FIRST-CLASS QUALITY NOT ONLY WITH RESPECT TO MATERIAL<br>AND WORKMANSHIP BUT ALSO AS TO DETAILS OF DESIGN IS TO<br>BE REGARDED ALWAYS AS THE PRIME CONSIDERATION NOT TO BE<br>SACRIFICED IN THE INTEREST OF LOWER COST OR OF MORE<br>SPEEDY CONSTRUCTION EXCEPT WHEN THE LATTER IS ESPECIALLY<br>AUTHORIZIED BY THE BUREAU.&quot;</p>
<p>HE ALSO SAID:</p>
<p>&quot;WHILE ECONOMY OF CONSTRUCTION MUST BE KEPT CONSTANTLY<br>IN MIND AND DILIGENTLY SOUGHT FOR, WHEN CONFLICT<br>ARISES BETWEEN ECONOMY AND QUALITY, THE LATTER IS<br>TO PREVAIL.&quot;</p>
<p>IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN THE SUBMARINE BUSINESS<br>UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW THESE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES. THERE HAVE BEEN<br>OCCASIONS WHEN SOME -- EVEN SENIOR OFFICIALS -- HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD<br>THIS. UNFORTUNATELY, SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE LOSS OF<br>A SUBMARINE TO BRING THIS FACT HOME TO THEM. BUT THIS IS TOO HIGH A<br>PRICE FOR YOUNG MEN TO PAY FOR TRANSIENT MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>SHIPBUILDING IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOW CONTROLLED BY LARGE CONGLOMERATES.<br>IN SOME CASES THE CONGLOMERATE&#x27;S PRIMARY INTEREST APPEARS TO BE ONLY TO MAKE<br>MONEY - REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY ARE MAKING, TOYS OR NAVAL SHIPS.</p>
<p>IN CONNECTION WITH THIS I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU WHAT IS STATED IN<br>MATTHEW:</p>
<p>“FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS, THERE WILL YOUR HEART BE ALSO.&quot;</p>
<p>I HAVE ALWAYS REMEMBERED THAT STATEMENT, AND THAT IT IS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.<br>BUT TO MAKE SURE OF ITS ACCURACY I ASKED LT R.T. EGOLF, WHO I HAD BEEN TOLD<br>WAS A CHURCH-GOING CHRISTIAN AND FAMILAR WITH THE NEW TESTAMENT, TO VERIFY<br>IT. HE MANAGED TO FIND A BIBLE , BUT HAD DIFFICULTY LOCATING THE VERSE.</p>
<p>SO HE ASKED ET3 M.A. STONE, ANOTHER REPUTED BIBLE &quot;EXPERT&quot;, TO ASSIST HIM.<br>AFTER ONE HALF HOUR, THE TWO &quot;EXPERTS&quot; FINALLY LOCATED THE VERSE. IT IS</p>
<p>IN MATTHEW 6:21.</p>
