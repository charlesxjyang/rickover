      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Delivered at sea in the North Atlantic on February 9, 1981, Admiral Rickover&#x27;s remarks commemorate the successful initial sea trials of the USS *San Francisco*, commending the engineers and craftsmen of Newport News for their excellent work and praising Commander Marshall and his crew for their outstanding performance, despite many being new to sea duty. Beyond the technical report, Rickover delivers a &quot;homily,&quot; reflecting on the vast changes from his early 20th-century childhood—a time of horses and darkness—to the modern era of nuclear weapons, space travel, and the silicon chip. He laments a perceived societal shift, noting the absence of a &quot;unifying faith&quot; and a decline in reliance on reason and common sense. Rickover passionately advocates for a rebirth of honorable conduct, confidence in human reason, and national pride, asserting these non-material ideals are fundamental to a nation&#x27;s true greatness.</p>

<p>Admiral rickover’s remarks on the san francisco sea trials</p>
<p>] especially want to congratulate the officers and men of the san francisco. Anyone witnessing these trials would find it hard to believe that only half the crew has been to sea before these trials except for short training periods.</p>
<p>Ons: there were then no automobiles on the road; horses were still ‘man’s most important companion and friend from the animal world. At night with*no electricity, there was total darkness). Only lit by the moon or stars, except for the barking of a dog or the hoof-beats of a horse, it was quiet, _ in the present age there 1S no unifying faith 79 bind US together: in its place there 1S only a hale-hearted adherence to many conflicting and divisive forms of ideolsgical or emotional nonsense,</p>
<p>Another attribute of that vanished age which distinguished it from that of the present day was a reliance of reasons on the cumulative knowledge of the pasts on common sense, instead of “pop”, or fashion or craze,</p>
<p>Alone, are what make a people great. And what our people are ~</p>
