      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his 1971 address upon receiving the General Leslie R. Groves Gold Medal Award, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover passionately argues for a strong national defense, emphasizing that weakness invites attack and dismissing the notion that modern war is obsolete. He highlights the alarming military expansion by the Soviet Union, particularly their burgeoning submarine fleet, noting they had built 580 modern submarines in 26 years compared to the US&#x27;s 113, and were outproducing US nuclear submarines 3-4:1, projecting a 50% lead by 1975. Rickover underscores the devastating lessons of World War II, citing figures like 26.8 million total soldiers killed and the immense Soviet losses, while quoting President Nixon on the necessity for the U.S. to maintain military superiority. He concludes by urging the American public to confront this &quot;unpalatable truth&quot; to avoid the catastrophic consequences of unpreparedness, recalling Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s ill-fated &quot;Peace for our time!&quot; declaration.</p>

<p>F THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY FOR RELEASE 8:00PM (EST)<br>OR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1971</p>
<p>AN EFFECTIVE NATIONAL DEFENSE--WHY?<br>y<br>Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy<br>upon accepting<br>THE GENERAL LESLIE R. GROVES GOLD MEDAL AWARD<br>from<br>The American Ordnance Association<br>New York Hilton Hotel</p>
<p>New York, New York<br>Wednesday, November 17, 1971</p>
<p>I have been asked to give you an estimate as to where we are and where we are<br>going and what needs to be done in a military way in these times of turmoil and<br>peril. There is, as you know, a division of opinion among the American people<br>regarding the necessity of reinforcing our military strength.</p>
<p>The first point I would like to make is that in judging between conflicting views<br>on this matter, the deciding factor must be their relevance to the world as it is, not<br>as we would wish it tobe. Granted the hideousness of modern war, can we deduce<br>therefrom that mankind is now wise enough to forego recourse to arms? A look at<br>history should put us on guard against those who claim that humanity has now<br>reached a state where, in formulating national policy, the possibility of armed<br>aggression can be safely disregarded.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the intense opposition to the Navy&#x27;s 15-cruiser bill in 1929.</p>
<p>It was argued by many that with the signing of the Kellogg Peace Pact the year<br>before it was no longer necessary to build new warships. And this in light of the<br>lessons of World War I which erupted despite the various Hague peace treaties.<br>Copyright 1971, H. G. Rickover</p>

<p>4 ships were of inestimable value in helping us win World War Il. The war</p>
<p>“gel was prolonged because Congress—heeding the &quot;merchants of death&quot; argument--<br>in 1939 prohibited shipment of war materials to Britain and France.</p>
<p>Then, too, weight must be given to the credentials of those propounding opposite<br>views. Are they public servants charged with the awesome responsibility to secure<br>our country against foreign conquest, or are they private individuals not accountable<br>to anyone for the consequences of their opinions; are they private individuals who feel<br>free to express their personal abhorrence of war and to agitate, within the screen of<br>rhetoric, for a reduction of the financial burden that military preparedness imposes<br>on the taxpayer? Would the majority of the electorate accept their argument that,<br>given our unmet domestic needs, we cannot afford an effective defense position<br>vis-a-vis our potential adversaries? Or that war is so horrible that it is better to<br>suffer defeat than to fight?</p>
<p>There can surely be no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the American<br>people are opposed to relinquishment of our defense capability, recognizing full well<br>that there will then be no one left to prevent the takeover by Communist power.<br>Whether one takes the optimistic view that a permanent East-West détente can be<br>negotiated, or the pessimistic view that ultimately we shall have to fight for our<br>liberties, this Nation has no future if it allows itself to be outmatched militarily.</p>
<p>As for the high cost of preparedness, the approximately 70 billion dollars<br>allocated to defense for fiscal year 1971 was the smallest percentage of our Gross<br>National Product in 20 years—just seven percent. Defense expenditures in that fiscal<br>year represented about 35 percent of our total Federal budget outlays, compared to</p>
<p>44percent in FY69. Omitting the costs of the Vietnam war and allowing for inflation,</p>
<p>Ar Armed Forces have less buying power today than they had two decades ago.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, on the other hand, resources have been diverted from the<br>farm sector to defense, and there appears to be increasing preoccupation with<br>national security. And you must bear in mind that actual war costs absorb but<br>a small portion of their expenditures while we are spending many billions of<br>dollars a year in Vietnam. As for myself, I would rather be alive at ten percent<br>than dead at seven percent.</p>
<p>If history teaches anything it is surely that weakness invites attack; that it<br>takes but one aggressor to plunge the world into war against the wishes of dozens<br>of peace loving nations, if the former is militarily strong and the latter are not.<br>Yet there are those who deprecate the need to maintain military supremacy or at<br>least parity with the Communist empires, on the grounds that other nations have<br>accepted a decline from first to second or third rank and that we ourselves for<br>most of our history were militarily a second-rate power yet secure enough within<br>our borders. They forget that we then profited from the Pax Britannica, even as<br>the former great powers of Europe who have lost their defense capability enjoy polit-<br>ical freedom today only because we are strong enough to defend them and ready to<br>do so. What it means to be weak and without American protection should be evident<br>to all who observed the tragic drama of Czechoslovakia &quot;negotiating&quot; with Russia<br>the continuing subjugation of her people.</p>
<p>The concept that a &#x27;&#x27;weapons race&quot; is the cause of war was a widely held theory</p>
<p>prior to World War I. Many historical studies of the causes of that war have</p>
<p>| proved this fallacy. And certainly it cannot be claimed that World War II was</p>
<p>caused by an armaments race. In fact that war might well have been prevented had<br>Britain, France, and the United States been better prepared. It was for this very<br>reason that at the end of World Wars I and II we vowed never again to be caught<br>unprepared. Whether or not to use our military forces is decided by our civilian<br>leaders, not by the military. The military is asked for advice, but the decision is that<br>of the civilian leadership.</p>
<p>Our Navy is not a direct threat to any country. Its strength lies in its ability to<br>be deployed rapidly at distances from the United States. Its very existence as a<br>&quot;fleet in being&quot; serves to deter those who might otherwise think lightly about starting<br>hostilities.</p>
<p>Many valuable lessons for today can be drawn from our experiences in past wars.<br>For example, when Germany decided to invade Russia in 1941, their staff studies<br>showed that the Soviet Union would be defeated in eight weeks, ten weeks at most.<br>Our military attaché in Moscow advised the War Department that the war would be<br>over in three months. I well remember that the German estimate for the length of<br>World War I was also three months.</p>
<p>These estimates should place us on guard against those who believe that long,<br>worldwide wars are no longer possible. Even the present &quot;minor&quot; Vietnamese war<br>has endured for longer than the foremost defense civilians and our military leaders<br>predicted. Having served in both World Wars, I may perhaps be forgiven for not<br>being as optimistic about permanent peace, the beneficence of unilateral<br>disarmament, and the current belief held by many--especially by our &quot;intellectuals&#x27;&#x27;--</p>
<p>that the sheer horror of a long war will compel its avoidance.</p>
<p>A brief look at some of the grim statistics of World War II will show why</p>
<p>prevention of war is an order of magnitude less costly than engaging in it. The<br>money we save today in lowering our defenses will surely be but a pittance compared<br>to what it will cost us if we are not strong enough to deter war.</p>
<p>Russia was invaded in June 1941. By winter of that year the cost of the war was<br>already truly colossal. To the six million, possibly as many as eight million<br>military losses in killed and captured were added millions of civilian casualties, a<br>million or more dead of starvation alone in Leningrad during the winter of 1941-1942.</p>
<p>By the end of 1941 the Soviet Union had lost 47 percent of her inhabited places,<br>territory in which 80 million persons had lived. That territory had produced 71<br>percent of Soviet pig iron, 58 percent of its steel, 63 percent of its coal, and<br>42 percent of its electricity. By the end of their 1941 offensive the Germans had<br>occupied areas that had produced 38 percent of the grain and cattle and 84 percent<br>of the Soviet sugar.</p>
<p>The total military service deaths on the Soviet side reached more than 12 million.<br>The West German estimate of Soviet military losses is 13.6 million, including 1.75<br>million permanently disabled. The war also cost the Soviets some seven million<br>civilians. The losses, civilian and military, of Finland, the Baltic States, and of<br>eastern and southeastern European countries added millions more.</p>
<p>The German military dead in World War II numbered between three and 3,5<br>million; their civilian dead 1.5 million.</p>
<p>The figures I have stated are vastly increased by the military and civilian dead</p>
<p>of Great Britain, France, the United States, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Japan, China,</p>
<p>And of many more countries. Poland lost one quarter of her entire people. The</p>
<p>total of all soldiers killed in World War II was 26. 8 million.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, few people study history, which accounts for the truism that<br>history repeats itself. In fact, not many of our people understand the devastation<br>wrought by World War Il. That war ended a quarter of a century ago. Half the<br>people in the United States were not alive then; they, as well as people then in<br>their early teens had no direct connection with the war. It is not too farfetched to<br>say that 75 percent of the American people have no vivid memory of what a world<br>war really means. The lesson of that war, its page of history, is worth a book of<br>logic.</p>
<p>You may remember Blackstone&#x27;s statement that security of the person is the<br>first, and liberty of the individual the second &quot;absolute right inherent in every<br>Englishman.&quot;&#x27; Just so, the first right of every American is to be protected against<br>foreign attack, and the first duty of Government is to keep our Nation alive. Given<br>the world situation, this calls for maintenance of a defense capability adequate to<br>discourage potential aggressors. President Nixon has said: &quot;. . . itis essential<br>to avoid putting an American President, either this President or the next President,<br>in the position where the United States would be second rather than first, or at<br>least equal to any potential enemy.&#x27;&#x27; He has also said, in discussing the Cuban<br>Missile Crisis: &quot;I do not want to see an American President in the future, in the<br>event of any crisis, have his diplomatic credibility--impaired because the United<br>States was in a second-class or inferior position. We saw what it meant to the</p>
<p>Soviets when they were second.&quot;</p>
<p>rning back to the present, you may ask what needs to be done in these times<br>of turmoil and peril. The blunt situation facing us is that Soviet Russia is doing<br>all the things a nation would do if it wanted to be the number one military power<br>with clear unequivocal superiority. The U.S. Navy has not taken any further<br>steps to increase its strategic offensive force. There has not been an arms race;<br>the Soviets have been running at full speed all by themselves.</p>
<p>However, as 1am most familiar with the threat posed by the Soviets to our<br>naval power, I would like to confine myself to this area, and specifically to<br>submarines. But the logic of what I say is valid for our land, sea, and airpower<br>as well.</p>
<p>The Soviets are embarked on a program which reveals a singular awareness<br>of the importance of seapower, and an unmistakable resolve to become the most<br>powerful maritime force in the world. They demonstrate a thorough understanding<br>of the basic elements of seapower: knowledge of the seas, a strong, modern<br>merchant marine, and a powerful new navy. They are surging forward with a<br>naval and maritime program that is a technological marvel.</p>
<p>Starting with 200 diesel powered submarines at the end of World War II, most<br>of which were obsolete, the Soviet Union embarked on the largest peacetime<br>submarine construction program in history, producing over 580 modern subma-<br>rines in 26 years—most designed for long-range operations. During the same<br>period the United States built 113 submarines. In two years alone, 1955 and 1956,<br>the Soviets completed 150 submarines, almost one and one half times the total<br>number of submarines this country has produced in the past 26 years.</p>
<p>The Soviets have applied tremendous national resources to the expansion and<br>modernization of their submarine construction yards. They now have the largest</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Es Sa</p>
<p>and most modern submarine building yards in the world, giving them several<br>times the nuclear submarine construction capacity possessed by the United States.</p>
<p>They are credited with a nuclear submarine production capability of 20 ships<br>a year on a single shift basis. They have the facilities to increase this rate of<br>production considerably. At present, while our Poseidon conversions are going<br>on, the maximum U.S. capacity to build nuclear submarines is less than half<br>that of the Soviets. Upon completion of these conversions—about 1977—the best<br>we could do would still be well below their capacity.</p>
<p>One of the most important steps they have taken has been the development of<br>a large reservoir of trained engineers to support their submarine design and<br>building program. They graduate ten times as many naval architects and marine<br>engineers per year as we. While we cannot specifically count the number of<br>Soviet scientists and engineers devoted to naval work, it is apparent that they have<br>created a broad technological base. They have committed extensive resources to<br>support development of their naval forces.</p>
<p>According to the latest unclassified data the Soviets now have a total of about<br>340 submarines, all built since World War II. About 100 of these are nuclear<br>powered. The total U.S. force is 137 submarines, 95 of which are nuclear<br>powered, the remainder diesel powered. Most of our diesel units were built<br>during World War II.</p>
<p>Today, as a result of the Soviet large-scale construction program, our lead<br>in nuclear powered submarines has disappeared. They are yearly outproducing<br>us in nuclear submarines by 3 or 4to 1. Even if we should decide at once to</p>
<p>reverse this trend, our efforts could not begin to bear fruit for several years; in</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>y the interim the Russian lead will grow substantially. By 1975 it is estimated</p>
<p>they will have something like 50 percent more nuclear submarines than the<br>United States.</p>
<p>Of even greater concern than total numbers is the fact that since 1968 the<br>Soviets have introduced several new designs besides converting older designs<br>to improve their capabilities. They have introduced significantly improved<br>second generation versions of the first generation attack, cruise-missile and<br>ballistic-missile nuclear submarine designs.</p>
<p>One of their current new designs is the YANKEE Class nuclear powered<br>ballistic-missile submarine introduced in 1968. These submarines look very<br>much like our latest Polaris type, and are capable of submerged launching of<br>16 ballistic missiles with a range of 1, 300 miles.</p>
<p>They now have come 35 of the YANKEE Class in operation or under construc-<br>tion; this class is being built at a rate of about six to eight a year. It is estimated<br>that they will surpass our Polaris fleet of 41 by 1974, probably sooner. Further,<br>it must not be forgotten that the Soviets also have over 30 conventional and nuclear<br>powered ballistic-missile submarines of an earlier design. Thus, we are faced<br>with the imminent loss of our lead in numbers of sea based strategic missiles—no<br>matter what action we take today.</p>
<p>While the extent of their submarine design and construction effort is alarming,<br>this is not the only area of concern. We have long relied on superior quality in<br>our submarines to compensate for lack of numbers. But recent evidence indicates<br>that the Soviets are making considerable progress in all aspects of submarine</p>
<p>capability, thus markedly reducing whatever qualitative advantage we may have</p>
<p>‘<br>(aad. Weapon systems, speed, detection devices, quietness of operation all make a</p>
<p>significant contribution to the effectiveness of a submarine force. From what we<br>have been able to learn, they have attained equality in a number of these character-<br>istics, and superiority in some.</p>
<p>The Soviet submarine force, like the entire Soviet Navy, has become capable of<br>sustained open ocean operations and is being used to support foreign policy in<br>various areas of the world. Last year the tempo of worldwide Soviet submarine<br>operations was at an all time high. During their 1970 large-scale naval maneuvers<br>that included over 200 ships in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and in nine adjoining<br>seas, they deployed a large number of nuclear submarines away from their home<br>bases.</p>
<p>Because of their expanding range of operations, the Soviet Navy can now deploy<br>long-range missiles in submarines hidden underwater along the entire length of<br>our Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, they can bring<br>95 percent of American population and industrial centers within the range of their<br>submarine based missiles. We must now reconcile ourselves to living with the<br>possibility of Russian submarines targeting their nuclear missiles on us from nearby<br>ocean areas we thought of until recently as friendly American waters.</p>
<p>The Russians are in the Mediterranean. They operate regularly and continually<br>in the North Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea. Russian naval units now are being<br>seen with regularity in the Indian Ocean and off both coasts of Africa. They are in<br>the Pacific, the Arctic, and the Antarctic. The swimming Russian bear is not yet</p>
<p>ten feet tall, but he is five feet, eight inches, and growing rapidly. He has not yet</p>
<p>ested supremacy of the seas from the free world but he is making a very<br>determined effort to do so. If we are not alert, we may find tomorrow that our<br>strength has been checkmated at sea.</p>
<p>Throughout our history the waters that wash our shores have been friendly.<br>They have given us geographical protection, making it practically impossible<br>for anyone to attack us. They have also given us time to build up our strength<br>when danger threatened.</p>
<p>But the tempo of modern technology has changed all this, as it has changed<br>so many other things. It has stripped this country of our &quot;friendly oceans.&quot;</p>
<p>The Atlantic and the Pacific are no longer &quot;friendly&quot;; they have become broad<br>highways whence attacks can be launched against us.</p>
<p>The fact that our country, previously invulnerable, has now become vulner-<br>able must sink into the public consciousness.</p>
<p>Today it is fashionable to advocate a reduction in defense and to use the money<br>saved for domestic purposes. Those who so advocate do not test their theories<br>or their deductions by events. While men are perishing from the eruption of a<br>volcano they are blissfully beating time and listening to the music of the heavenly<br>spheres and marveling at the harmony. Meanwhile Soviet Russia is preparing a<br>military establishment which, by 1975, can be ahead of ours in virtually all<br>respects.</p>
<p>The bearer of bad news is always punished. In ancient times, he might be<br>put to death. Today he becomes &quot;controversial&quot; and unpopular. But if there is<br>one subject on which the American people must know the truth, however unpalat-</p>
<p>able, it is our military position vis-a-vis the Soviets.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>&quot;Peace for our time!&quot; declared Neville Chamberlain. And what was to<br>follow was six years of one of the bloodiest conflicts ever experienced by<br>mankind—a conflict that nearly wrecked Western Civilization. Let us hope</p>
<p>that the lessons of appeasement and unpreparedness have not receded into the</p>
<p>dim shadows of past victory.</p>
