      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his May 17, 1960 speech, &quot;The Talented Mind – An Opportunity and an Obligation,&quot; Admiral H.G. Rickover asserts that a &quot;good mind&quot; is a priceless endowment carrying a profound obligation to be intelligently developed for both personal fulfillment and national strength. He argues that while physical frontiers may have closed, intellectual pursuits offer new, deeply rewarding &quot;adventures of the mind.&quot; Rickover highlights significant demographic and resource changes since the nation&#x27;s founding &quot;hundred and eighty-four years ago,&quot; noting the population&#x27;s surge from four million to 180 million (increasing by three million annually), and the drastic shift from exporting 15% of raw materials 50 years prior to depending on imports for 10% today. He projects that within 25 years, the U.S. might consume 80% of total world production. Rickover champions &quot;brain power&quot; as the essential solution to resource scarcity and technological advancement, criticizing &quot;anti-intellectualism&quot; and &quot;watered-down curricula&quot; for failing to cultivate the talented youth needed to address these critical challenges and secure the nation&#x27;s future.</p>

<p>THE TALENTED MIND - AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION</p>
<p>As I look at the bright faces of the young men and women —<br>whose achievement we have come here to honor, I am impressed. with<br>the thought: How fortunate are these young people! Fortunate,<br>in that God has blessed you with a priceless endowment. What. has<br>been given all of you is the most lasting, the most persistently<br>satisfying, the most all-around useful of natural endowments - a</p>
<p>really good mind. | | : ee</p>
<p>I trust that you will not let yourselves be proud of this<br>gift. It reflects no particular credit on you. Nor is it a<br>guarantee of success in life. Rather does it resemble a vein of<br>precious metal imbedded in rock - valuable only when it has been<br>mined intelligently and laboriously. But with it, an unusual —<br>Copyright H. G@.

<p>opportunity is granted you to develop yourselves into successful<br>human beings in fields of activity where success must always be.<br>rare and difficult. :</p>
<p>You are here because you have already taken the first step<br>towards making use of your good fortune. You have given that<br>good mind of yours what it most needs - exercise in meeting an<br>intellectual challenge. In doing this you have shown yourselves<br>worthy of the endowment with which you have been blessed. You<br>have demonstrated that you can marshall the ambition and stick-to-<br>itiveness which a good mind demands. You have taken the first<br>&#x27; step towards success in your chosen. fields, but only the first.</p>
<p>Like most of today&#x27;s youth, you must at times have felt you<br>missed something exciting and important because you were born in<br>the 20th century, at a time when almost a all frontier areas of<br>this country had disappeared and with them the adventure<br>formerly enjoyed py many a young man and woman, of hewing out<br>their destiny, dependent on no power on earth but their own will<br>and ability. Today there is hardly a spot on this globe which<br>has not been discovered and mapped. For most people, life, while<br>doubtless more comfortable, lacks the spice of discovery and<br>adventure so dear to young spirits.</p>
<p>Yet it 1s precisely in this respect that your good fortune<br>manifests itself most dramatically, for you carry in your own a<br>minds potentialities for adventure and discovery not shared by</p>
<p>most of your contemporaries. You have as many opportunities for</p>
<p>exciting living as people born a hundred or more years egos a ?<br>different in kind, perhaps, but opportunities not one whit less<br>exciting and rewarding than those which vanished at the turn of<br>this century.</p>
<p>Capable and ambitious young people could once fashion their<br>lives by their own efforts in wild and unmapped areas of the<br>physical world; you can be pioneers today in the wild and unmapped<br>world of the arts and the sciences. In the short span of three<br>centuries, since man first learned to think and experiment<br>scientifically, enormous advances have been made. But enough<br>remains to be discovered and mapped to guarantee excitement and<br>sdventure..to more young men and women than we are likely to have<br>for many years to come.</p>
<p>I recommend that you make your life an adventure of the mind.</p>
<p>This will at times be hard, but always deeply rewarding. When you</p>
<p>reap the fruits of your own intellectual labor you will experience<br>the satisfaction of having proved yourselves good cultivators of<br>the talents given you by Providence. Over and above all this,<br>you will know that yours is a kind of pioneering which yields not<br>alone personal gain and satisfaction, but also contributes<br>significantly to the cultural and economic and hence the political<br>strength and security of our country. This you will find the<br>greatest reward of all.</p>
<p>There never has been a time in the history of our country<br>when it so greatly needed the services of its talented youth. one</p>
<p>hundred and eighty-four years ago, this nation was born one new :<br>_eontinent, sparsely populated by four million people. Seldom has<br>a new nation started life under such favorable circumstances.</p>
<p>Not the least of these was the political inheritance which :<br>&quot;enabled the founding fathers to devise a form of government ae<br>marvelously suited to a vast land with fabulous natural resources<br>which had to be developed by a small population. The Constitution<br>4nsured fullest scope for each individual&#x27;s abilities. Moreover,<br>our continuing scarcity of labor helped us to hold fast to that |<br>basic respect of the individual which the first settlers brought<br>with them from England, and which 1s the foundation of our</p>
<p>democratic way of life.</p>
<p>The open frontier kept us socially mobile and therefore<br>checked any tendency towards the class barriers so apt to<br>accompany advances in civilization, and which are characteristic<br>of most highly civilized but static societies. Respect for the</p>
<p>-4ndividual, full opportunities for all, abundance of land and<br>natural resources, and a government eminently suited to our<br>particular needs built this nation into the formidable giant it<br>is today.</p>
<p>In recent years some of the foundations upon which we built<br>in the past have begun to crumble or have vanished altogether.<br>Instead of four million people, lost in a vast wilderness hardly</p>
<p>touched by man, we now have 180 million, increasing annually by</p>
<p>three million, or almost as many new Americans as lived here on</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>the eve of the Revolution. In fact, we may goon reach a density<br>of population close to that of the old ccuntries of Europe. =<br>Virtually no good free land is left; much of the wilderness which<br>nurtured the free spirit of earlier Americans has all but been<br>buried under factories, cities, and suburban developments. Ana,<br>where even as recently as 50 years ago, we exported 15% of our<br>raw materials, we now depend on the rest of the world for 10% of<br>our raw material needs.</p>
<p>The turning point occurred only a few years ago. Today our<br>consumption of raw materials grows at a compound rate. If we<br>continued to expand our consumption at this same pace for the<br>next 25 years, our needs would reach &amp; fantastic 80% of total<br>world production, leaving only 20% for all other countries. Let<br>me illustrate with a few figures what this momentous change in<br>our raw materials position, from @ resources-exporting to a<br>resources-importing country, portends for our economic health and<br>political strength. -</p>
<p>Advances in medicine and public sanitation have quadrupled<br>the world&#x27;s population since the middle of the 18th century, and<br>population is increasing at a geometrical rate. Our own country<br>has the highest percentage of natural increase in population of<br>the large industrial nations of the world - an increase higher<br>even than that in Japan and Italy. Scientific calculations give<br>“us the astonishing estimate that one out of every 20 human beings</p>
<p>who have ever trod this earth is alive today.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>This enormous and ever-growing population must now be fed,<br>clothed, and housed by cultivating land which over vast areas has —<br>become depleted through erosion and faulty agriculture; by<br>harvesting the.products of the sea and of inland waters which<br>likewise have become depleted by unintelligent overfishing and by<br>pollution; and by consuming irreplaceable mineral and fuel |<br>resources. The United States alone, for example, has consumed a8<br>much in irreplaceable mineral and fuel resources since 1914 as<br>had then been used by all the world in all of the 5,000 years of<br>history since man first discovered bronze. And much of this ne<br>priceless heritage has been and is being squandered in anappall ingly<br>wasteful manner. :</p>
<p>From a scarcely populated, fabulously resources-rich country<br>184 years ago we have changed to a densely populated, resources-<br>poor country today. We are, of course, not as poor in resources<br>nor as heavily populated as most of the industrial powers of the<br>world. We are still rich compared to such countries as Britain<br>‘ or Italy. In fact, with but 10% of the population of the free<br>world and 8% of its land area, we consume close to half the free<br>world&#x27;s volume of materials. These figures are frequently used<br>to illustrate that we have the highest standard of living in the |<br>world. What seems more significant to me is that these figures<br>also indicate our increasing dependence on foreign countries for<br>vitally needed minerals and fuels. When measured with our wealth</p>
<p>of but a few short years ago, we are therefore poor, and we are</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>poorer still when measured against our future needs.</p>
<p>The shrinking of the once broad mate<br>industrial civilization makes us for the<br>history dependent on foreign countries fo</p>
<p>technical organization. So far we have h</p>
<p>what we need abroad. But it would not be</p>
<p>rials base of our<br>first time in our<br>r materials pasic to our<br>ad no difficulty buying</p>
<p>wise to count on this.</p>
<p>We shall not remain truly free and powerful unless we compensate,</p>
<p>to the fullest possible extent, for lack</p>
<p>of materials resources</p>
<p>within our own borders. There 4s one way, and only one way; that</p>
<p>this can be done. It is by using far more effectively than</p>
<p>heretofore our natural resources 4n brain power; we must substitute</p>
<p>4ntellectual resources for diminishing ma</p>
<p>terials resources.</p>
<p>Applied to this problem, brain power can devise ways of</p>
<p>extracting at reasonable cost the considerable store of low-grade</p>
<p>minerals and fuels still remaining to us which we are not</p>
<p>utilizing today because of excessive cost</p>
<p>in time and labor - thus</p>
<p>taconite and shale oil may in time make up for the threatened</p>
<p>deficit in high-grade ores and oil. It can discover ways of</p>
<p>replacing scarce materials with plentiful</p>
<p>-‘eonsidered unusable, as aluminum is repla</p>
<p>Trained minds may be able to relieve shor</p>
<p>and fuels by creating man-made substitute</p>
<p>materials heretofore<br>cing scarcer copper.<br>tages of natural minerals</p>
<p>8 as plastics and</p>
<p>synthetic rubber have reduced our dependence on imported tin and</p>
<p>natural rubber, or as atomic power may replace coal and oil.</p>
<p>Similarly, synthetic products made from renewable resources nay</p>
<p>serve as substitutes for irreplaceable ma</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>terials.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need brain power most to teach us the folly of<br>needlessly wasting the inheritance of our children. Using “<br>irreplaceable materials resources is like using up your capital<br>4nstead of learning to live on your interest or earnings. No<br>matter how slowly we deplete capital, the day must come when we<br>have nothing to leave our descendants. For almost two centuries<br>we have been wasteful because we thought our natural resources<br>were inexhaustible. |</p>
<p>It will take wise and 4ntelligent guidance — to change our<br>ways. But eventually we may learn to deny ourselves today&#x27;s<br>pleasures for the sake of leaving enough for our children to let<br>them enjoy the blessings of civilized living. We may even learn<br>to deny ourselves such pleasant luxuries as large, chrome-trimned<br>ears, powered by high-octane gas which discharges thousands of |<br>tons of scarce and irreplaceable lead into the air. Changes in<br>national outlook such as these can only be pioneered by people<br>whose minds are able to grasp the scientific problems involved,<br>and who can make them understood by the average citizen.</p>
<p>It is a truism needing no elaboration that as society becomes<br>more complex technologically, it needs proportionately more, a8<br>well as qualitatively petter, trained professionals. - Thus, while<br>the population of the United States has doubled in the last 50<br>years, the number of 4tes professional men and women has quadrupled.<br>We have today five times more engineers and ten times more</p>
<p>scientists than half a century ago and yet there are still not</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>eae sour ena ee —<br>: Ss : eee eee signee</p>
<p>Se a ee</p>
<p>_—e</p>
<p>enough. To increase our national product by a given percentage<br>annually we must increase our seientific and engineering poesonnel:<br>twice as fast. With every step forward in technological progress,<br>the nation pecomes more dependent on 4ts trained brain power.</p>
<p>Moreover, the closer we come to scarcity of natural materials<br>resources, the heavier grows our demand upon the quality of our<br>trained man power. Just as q° is far easier to dig a lump of<br>coal from a surface vein than it. 4s to pump oil from a deep well,<br>perhaps puried under tons of! sea water, 80 it is more difficult ©<br>to release the power locked in the atom than the power held in<br>falling water. Substitution of man-made for natural resources,<br>petter utilization of inferior natural resources, elimination of<br>waste - all these demand the raising of our entire body of<br>engineering and scientific knowledge to &amp; higher plateau.</p>
<p>In the past, man&#x27;s advances in technology have been slow<br>whenever theoretical knowledge failed to move forward. Rome, for<br>example, had everything she needed to puild structures of |<br>reinforced concrete except the necessary theoretical ‘ymowledge of<br>stresses, thrusts, and distribution of weights. From Egypt and<br>Greece, Rome had 4nherited practical knowledge in puilding<br>structures based on lintel and post; from the Etruscens she had<br>inherited the arch; and in Italy she found the raw materials from<br>which she learned by accident to develop a hard and durable</p>
<p>cement. Greece had already ‘.xperimented with strengthening</p>
<p>masonry by imbedding 4ron rods in grooves. ‘Had Rome been able to</p>
<p>Sabine these methods with theoretical kmowledge, she could have<br>puilt her aqueducts and pipe Lines more durably and far less<br>expensively with reinforced cement. =: j<br>In a sense we are today at the Roman stage as regards<br>metallurgical science for nuclear reactor requirements. We must<br>advance not only our knowledge of theoretical and applied nuclear<br>physics but also our entire level of engineering and metallurgy.<br>Similar advances in theoretical knowledge are needed throughout<br>the entire field of science and engineering 4f technical civilization<br>is to be maintained and advanced in a resources-poor world; . How<br>successfully a country manages to raise itself by its own oe<br>pootstraps to ever higher stages of scientific and engineering ion<br>competence will determine that country&#x27;s position in the world.<br>The fate of our country rests in the hands of those of its<br>citizens whose natural endowments enable them to push back the<br>boundaries of knowledge. :<br>You young people have the ability to grow into empire<br>puilders of the 4{ntellectual realm. I hope you will be inspired<br>to adventurous search beyond present boundaries. I hope you will |<br>not let yourselves be deflected from pursuing this aim by accepting<br>positions having less 4ntrinsic importance put greater material<br>rewards. I hope you will firmly withstand the constant pressure<br>by the advocates of the greatest of modern fallacies - that</p>
<p>_ material possessions are the mark of the successful man. Man&#x27;s</p>
<p>acquisitive traits are not what make him great. Nor can true</p>
<p>greatness be measured in dollars and cents. What money value can</p>
<p>you assign a book on which the author has labored for years and</p>
<p>which may inspire you to actions having incalculable effects? Is</p>
<p>4t worth only its price of three or five dollars? How would you</p>
<p>value the piece of paper on which Einstein scribbled the simple</p>
<p>equation which in its ultimate effects may preserve the freedom</p>
<p>of the West by providing 4t with nuclear power to replace coal</p>
<p>and o11? Is the pay you receive to be the only measure of the</p>
<p>value of your job? No! Nothing material can ever give the</p>
<p>intelligent man or woman such deep satisfaction as successful |</p>
<p>solution of an intellectual problem that challenges the mind.</p>
<p>We are ‘engaged 4n a grim duel. You are familiar with the</p>
<p>threat to American technical supremacy which may materialize af</p>
<p>Russia succeeds in her ambitious program of achieving world</p>
<p>scientific and engineering supremacy by turning qut vast numbers</p>
<p>of well- trained scientists and engineers. Democracies move |</p>
<p>slower than totalitarian dictatorships. We have let our edugational<br>problem grow much too big for comfort and safety. We are.</p>
<p>beginning to see now that we must solve it without delay.</p>
<p>The theories Qf progressive educationists have left a deep<br>4mpact which sannot easily be erased. Stung by criticism American<br>educationists are making an effort to shift the entire responsibility<br>for watered-down | curricula on the American public. But the public<br>has now awakened to the need for school 4mprovement while</p>
<p>educationists still erect roadblocks to genuine reform. One has</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>but to steep himself in the writings of leading educationists to</p>
<p>sense their profound anti-intellectualism and dislike for quality<br>education.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest danger has been our failure to provide<br>adequate educational opportunities for our gifted youth and, in<br>particular, to seek out the talented at an early age and to give<br>them an education which challenges their minds and induces them<br>to become trained professionals. 7</p>
<p>We must remember that democracy is not merely a political<br>and social device to insure that under a popularly elected ee<br>government each citizen may enjoy complete personal freedom,</p>
<p>bounded only by the equal rights of other citizens. It is far<br>§</p>
<p>more than that. Democracy guarantees to the individual freedom<br>and opportunity to develop his mind and character to his maxdmum<br>potential without hindrance from external sources so that he. may<br>put them to use not only for himself but for the community ap<br>well. eas = ;<br>Sometimes we forget democracy is not a matter of rights<br>alone; that it depends for its very life on acceptance of<br>corollary duties. If democracy meant no more than freedom of<br>each citizen to enjoy himself, provided in so doing he harmed ‘no<br>one else, it would be a shabhy creed indeed for the people of a</p>
<p>great country; an uninspiring banner under which to fight the |</p>
<p>enemies of freedom.</p>

<p>The men who established this nation and who devised the<br>political institutions which have served us 50 well realized that<br>democracy puts heavy obligations upon the citizen.
