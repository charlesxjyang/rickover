      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this 1954 address, Admiral Hyman Rickover outlines his philosophy for &quot;Administering a Large Military Development Project,&quot; emphasizing that effective management centers on people, not just technical facts. He challenges traditional notions of leadership, asserting that a &quot;God-like&quot; figure possessing all virtues is impossible, and advocates for a &quot;political approach&quot; to achieve objectives, even citing George Washington&#x27;s use of politics in appointments. Rickover details the development of the naval nuclear propulsion program as a case study, highlighting the importance of individual initiative, continuous training, personal responsibility, and the strategic acquisition of &quot;Hunting Licenses&quot; (official authorizations) and funding from agencies like the AEC. He critiques organizational inertia, short tours of duty, and &quot;over-coordination,&quot; stressing the need for leaders who can foster open-mindedness, challenge rules, learn from failure, and integrate scientific research with technological application, ultimately seeking to make scientists and engineers work in harmony.</p>

        <p>Ruring the vast Lifteon years I have addressed the students of the</p>
<p>Posteraduste School at Annapolis on 2 number of occasions. My talks heave etl been confined to technical matters, and they have not required exten- . sive preparation, beceuse I was talking about datters faniliar to ne, and</p>
<p>vhich dealt with things, with engineering facte, which I coulda diecuss with</p>
<p>_ some fncility and with objectivity. Sub when one talke about how a job 42 dons, he necessarily talks about peonle, ani not about things. He enters the realu of the subjective. His _ thoushts and his actiong stem from his personality, fron his om experience, from hie own view of things. &quot;The temétntion is strong to talk in goneraite | ties, to define eccomplishmert in texms of standards of ormanization; or to | stress the ofterepeatad qualities of leatership, ‘such og AIntellivonce, wicdon, ; honssty, virtues, tact, grace, sgressiveness, huni lity, courege, tenncity, ond - So on - in other words to describe not a man but who possesses tio cbtributes of a God, In my younger days I was pyothered ty these eriteria, Somehow, thinzs uu Just didn't work out the way the hooks on administration end on losdership weld they should, and I early beceme aware that I could never qualify as a | leader, if it were really necessary that I possess the twenty or so qualie | - thes most books or articles on leadership claimed te be necessary. So far, . I havo found no one in the Nevy or in industry who possesses more then a fow of thees qualities, and co I have rezretfally come to the conclusion that ths only person who ever possessed all of them died some 1900 years ez. I mention this because the quest for the Snnoasihle may so condition ug 2g to prevent us from accomplishing ths yoesibdie.</p>
<p>“olitics has teen detinad as the art of the possible. In my opinion,</p>
<p>politicians ara those men who more face up to the realities of the world ard of mankind, then any other grou of citizens. A politician must set things gone, or ha loses offices, T commend to you the politica? approach towards accomplishing objectives.</p>
<p>. ne thing that can be said for it is that 1+ works. 4A very eminent Secretary | ‘of the Navy, iy. Forrestal, onea saids &quot;Government without polities is Like conception without sex.&quot; And 4¢ will probably surprise you to iow | - that even George Vashington practiced politice 4n the appolatment and / promotion of officers when he considered 1% necessary to do so for ths , public good. He once wrote: |</p>
<p>‘Sut if officers will not see into the political motives by which I am sometines governed in my appointments, and which the mood of the common enusa renders indi spensably necessary, it is unfortunate; but 1% cannot, because it ought not, divert me from tha nrsctice of a duty, which I think promotes the interests of the United States, and is consistent with the view of that power under which 2 nat, =ha development of naval nuclear propulsion plants is a good exan ole ' of how one goes about getting a job done. It 18 a good subject to study | for nethods, becnuse 1% involves not only the accomplishment of a vecos- ninod diffiewlt techaical operation, tn which emenditura of hundreds of millions of dollars is necessary, but also because it involves the intl- ; mate working tomether of tvo large governmontal orzmisationa, the Usvy on on the ones hand, and a civilian orzant zation, she Atomile Enerey</p>
<p>Comission, on the other. It has involved the establishment of procedures</p>
<p>= and wayo.of doiria government business for which there was no precedent,</p>
<p>ond which I beldave will b@ necessary in future for dA miler large projects. The first step toward aoconphi shing saything 4a to have a + BOUL, Senda</p>
<p>woot 4% gome point, sooner or later, orem’ entions lend their nemes to’ a project, but the concent and the Initial - wor't 4 always started by on individual, This is difficult for military weoole to comprehend, because they ars used to operating mier a rolatively niga 4rmorsonal aystem. Offictal letters, for exomle, are written in | the third person; the Sumgarancg ig thet &amp; Bureau or an Office does sone~ thing. It should be obvious that Burenna and Offices are insninate, and | - therefore carmot generate ideas or do things. Zar}y in 1046 the Nanhattan District decided to. build an atomic power . pile to demonstrate penesful avplication of atomic energy. Industry, £2 | . well ag the Amy, Rav$ and Air Corns, vere invited to perticipate in the + technical work at Oak Aides. Several officera and civilians were sent hy the Uavy. I was the senior one of the group. All of the neval officers .ené the civilian engineers were sent as individuals to be essigned by the Kanhatten Dietrict as they considered necessary. At Oak Ridge the Navy people ware assigned to various disconnected activities and no serious | . thought was given to their education. i goon realized that voless the “ivy people were organt sed into a unit and their training and education tystematd zed we vould comlote our year's stay at Oak Ridge and still not he srepared to commence work on an atonie propulsion plant. Since the</p>
<p>+ Sureau of Ships was in no position formally to request such organization,</p>
<p>I established versonnl relations with the military and selentific people at Oak Kidge, and soon all of the Navy people were aseigned to me. I arrenged for their seneral education dn nuclear mattors, and, in addition, ‘eesigned ench one 2 specialty in which he was to become proficient. The _ Tesult was thet by ‘the tine we left Ons Ridge we had the nucleus of a  -tecknierl orzand sation. ‘The oreparation and the writing of reports is a tedions and wnveleoe. _ gob, when one 4s already devoting moat of hie time to study. But I kmew | that it was important that the Chter of the Buresu understend vhat we were oF &quot; doing. So I compiled a list of reports which were to be prepared during _ the year and essicned them to individusls to prepare. The result was, that ones every two wocks &amp; report covering 4 spocific technical subject was sent out. ‘hese reports served two valuable purvorses; they forced the . Students to learn the specialized subject, and at the semo tine they served ts educate the leading paowle in the Bureau of the actual statue of nuclear power. the next step was to select a muiteblo navel vessel, and a suitable reactor to be developed. After considerable disausston we agresd that the subserine offered the greatest promise, and that a thermal neutron, water cooled reactor, the beat propulsion plant. Betause we were closely organi zed and fairly well trained in nuclear technolozy in aécordance vith vhat was known. at the time, we were in a “position to take adyantoge of any opportunity which might arise. Such om opportuni ty goon cane. | Bec ause work on the power pile at Oak Ridge ¢ ase not pan out -vell,</p>
<p>the “tonde Energy Comnission, which hed replaced the Nanhattan District,</p>
<p>| decided to cancel the project. Becnuse we were on the spot, becauss we were organized as a grows and knew what we “wanted, we were able, without</p>
<p>- the Vashineton authorities realizing it, to divert the people ang the offort - at On Ridge to the atudy of a submarine nile.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, we all returned to “achington. The naval grow</p>
<p>| wes broken up and assigned to different duties. Wavertheless I continued in ny effort to achieve nuclear propalsion for-a sabmorine. There was now &amp; ztoup of scientists end engineers studying the problem at ate Ridga, but ‘no anthorizetion for the work, and no requirement for a nuclear submarine by tha Favy.. Obviously 1t was only a matter of a short time before the work would be terminated, unless the Navy itself decided it wanted an atonie | - gubacrine ond suscecded in couvincing the Atomic Shorey Conni sation that it was important. ,</p>
<p>30 the next aten was to obtain a &quot;Hunting License*. This is a piece</p>
<p>of pnger which authorizes one to do a certain thing. It is frecuently</p>
<p>_enlled a directive, or sone much descriptive tora. One must have such a</p>
<p>fe : piece of paper as a &quot;Huhting License&quot;in Governnent, «if he 13 to gat anye | thing dons. | — Contrary to what most navel officers balievs, nerticularly those uho | heve not had duty in Vashington, policy letters and other important Jocae~ ments sigaed by the Secretary of the Nevy or by the Chie? of Naval Qperations sre not prepared by then, but by the particular individual who. wente the Job done. It de he who must fight the policy letter through . tho various layers and levels before 4t reaches the Chief of Level .</p>
<p>| Cnerations or the Seeretory of the Mary,</p>
<p>fhig requires tenacity and considersble patience, becouse the Navy</p>
<p>Zopertmont te like an autonobile with elx indtytdnal brakes; the car cannot start until oll six passengers agree to release their breke. Many individuals in a large orgenisation have the power to cay &quot;Ho¥ = and many orofects are stouved because the originator nects discourasenent after Giscournasenent ond finslly saye “vhat the hell&quot;, or else is transferred to other duty. .</p>
<p>Therefore, one nust Lave a seleable 4ten which Appeals to a larze group of ngople « preferably to thore in responsible positione, 4g a rule, the “hd. dher paople ara in an orsont za tion, the more receptive they are to new. . idens, and the problem is how to get to thege high people, This requiras | a thoroush knovledse of the organiantion, of the mental attitude of those who misht eporove and of thosa who nicht disesnrove. There ere many who will disapprove. They ars like onlookers. in a struzele in which they have not vergonal stake. They are aden’ at the etiquettes of orsint zations,</p>
<p>Dat nt thout experience in doing things. They must be by-passed,</p>
<p>In Shia procesd of obtaining the ‘Hinting License*, as well as obteine ing npproval of any other important idea, the method of presentation 1s imortant. If you have a proposal with five pointe, for exemple, don't . trv to call all five at one time. Likewise don't try to sell 5 points</p>
<p>sinulteneously to a group of 5 people. If one of the § objects to one of the moposdle, he will: vote against your entire vacknse. . If three of the &amp; gach object to one of the proposnle, then your whole packaze is dest, Sut if you only present one proposal at a time, you cnn atend to heve two people vote againat you, snd still win out.</p>
<p>It 4s also well to renember that mony important veople fail to become</p>
<p>rserested in various projects, not because they lack interest, but because</p>
<p>‘they lack tine. Therefore, you must so plan that your own project receives the sttontion of these veoyla,</p>
<p>Having obtained the “Iunting License” you must set about imolenenting</p>
<p>4%. &quot;Hunting Licenses&quot; are not too difficult to obtain. The possession of</p>
<p>&amp; license is no fuasrentee of success. Thare are generally more hunting . icennes iseued than there are deer to be hunted. Only the persistent hunter ever gete aceer. First the honter must get a sun; this 4a vulearly mown an governnent as *monsy&quot; « end without money nothing but good will can he . obtained. | it takes considerable thoucht, work, and time to obtain the funds necessary to carry on 2 large nroject. But since nothing can be done withe _ out money, this necessarily takes sriority over all other matters, In the . ; Defense Zatadlishment there are about § offices we must eo throuch before | * tha ‘ease is presented to ths Bureau of the Budget. And any one of these . ‘omn deny the funds or decrense the anount. . In the ATC It is much less difficult. The case is presented to the five Consissioners, and, if they approve, 1+ coss directly to the Bursau of the Budvet. | It 4s extrenely fortunats that in the early years of cur project we were finenced almost entirely by the A&quot;C. To have hed te go throuch the avy procedure in thoss deve, and to convince the many people who possessed</p>
<p>veto power = might have resulted in considerable delay in getting started. .</p>
<p>in the besinning wa obtained nearly all of our funds from the AZC,</p>
<p>Gradunily the Novy sertian ‘ian heen ineronsing, until now the AUC supplies ‘. about 75° of the resonrch snd development fonds, and tha Kevy avout at. | the ability to draw on funds from two distinct agencies is a very valuable one. shen the rules of one do not nernit certain work to be done, the rules of the other generally do. ) ‘ihe ARG, by law, controls all atonic energy work: no one, including the | &quot;avy, can ennace in this work unlass authorized by the AZO. It hecame abviows to me from the first, that if we wore to olay an active and simmifie cant role in developing navel atomic propulelon vlants, we had to beeane . z estsdlished 2s an integral part of the AEG. After about one year of nolitike | ing I wae finally ordered to duty in the AEC as Chief of the Haval Rexctors Branch, Abt the eane time I was assigned additional duty es Head of the Nuclear Power Division of the Surenu of Ships, Thus, one nerson, one sroun of seovle, aeved for both the ARC and the Navy. Sy being nart of the ALC ve achieved a powerful position to assist in formulating volicy and in obtaining monoy. We have offiecss in the ARC and in the Wavy.

Ag far as 1 know this was the first instance tn fovernmen’t where PS gingle #rous of people acted in 3 line eamacity for hoch a nilitery aroney | ond a otvilian agency. , In modern war the military ennnot stand alone. ‘The armed Yoreas are but the catting eda of a swords tho civilian effort, “‘dneluging industry, goverment and the national institutions and culture —</p>
