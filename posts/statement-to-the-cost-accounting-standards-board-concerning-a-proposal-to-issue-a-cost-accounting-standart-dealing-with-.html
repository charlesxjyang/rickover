      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s October 31, 1973, statement to the Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) urges the adoption of realistic depreciation standards for defense contracts, arguing that current tax-based methods are inappropriate for cost accounting. He praises the CASB&#x27;s initial work, including lowering the disclosure threshold from $30 million to $10 million, but presses for a faster pace and less susceptibility to industry complaints. Rickover highlights the unique, non-competitive nature of defense procurement, where 90% of contracts are negotiated and higher costs can lead to greater profits, enabling conglomerates to prioritize cash flow for other ventures over efficient facility investment. He refutes common industry arguments for accelerated depreciation by citing *American Machinist* inventory data showing two-thirds of U.S. machine tools are over 10 years old, and examples like dry docks being depreciated over 12 years (vs. a more realistic 40-100 years) leading to significant cost discrepancies (e.g., $1.2 million vs. $200,000 annually for identical jobs). Rickover concludes by calling for the CASB to enforce standards based on actual service life and use, ensuring comparability and transparency, which he deems essential for the integrity of the accounting profession and the broader capitalist system.</p>

        <p>October 31, 1973 by VADM H, G, RICKOVER, USN</p>
<p>You have asked me to talk about depreciation, One should not always feel it is</p>
<p>incumbent on him to make some profound statement on a subject in which he</p>
<p>is not an expert, I am not an expert in accounting, but I will try to give</p>
<p>you some observations from my experience, I cannot refrain from also making</p>
<p>some observations about your work during the past two years,</p>
<p>I have been honored to know your chairman, Elmer Staats,</p>
<p>time, lie is one of the Outstanding men in public life,</p>
<p>The nature of his</p>
<p>job, which he does with quiet distinction, denies him the public recognition</p>
<p>his performance deserves,</p>
<p>As this Board surely knows, Government is not a bit of machinery that</p>
<p>needs only to be properly fueled to run well. It needs clear direction,</p>
<p>You are fortunate to have Mr. Staats! leadership in your important work,</p>
<p>When the board first was established, I was concerned about the</p>
<p>pressures which would be brought to undermine your work, have an excellent staff and, in Mr, Schoenhaut ,</p>
<p>executive secretary. So far you have done well:</p>
<p>Fortunately, you</p>
<p>- You have fought off efforts to move the Board to the executive branch,</p>
<p>- You have resisted pressures to include loopholes in the standards you have issued,</p>
<p>- You have lowered the threshold for contractor Disclosure Statements from $30 to $10 million in negotiated defense prime contracts.</p>
<p>- You are gaining a reputation as a competent and dedicated group, Although some defense contractors have criticized the Board for some of its decisions, as you could expect them to, I have never heard them question the competence of the Board or its fairness,</p>
<p>In a Government of large and frequently ineffective organizations, it is a pleasure to see your small group having a major impact. Although only part of your job has been done, you have already had a far- reaching effect. The requirement that defense contractors disclose their cost accounting practices and follow them consistently provides a basis for open and fair dealings with the Government, Even nondefense agencies have now invoked the Board's standards for their negotiated contracts. The idea of setting standards has spread also to the field of financial accounting, where the accounting profession recently established a full-time Financial</p>
<p>Accounting Standards Board. I would hope that they face their challenges</p>
<p>with the intelligence and dedication which characterizes your Board--</p>
<p>and not become just a facade for the accounting &quot;profession.&quot;</p>
<p>Reform does not come easily, It is easy to do nothing, It is easy</p>
<p>to concentrate on attacking the symptoms, to seek short-term placebos,</p>
<p>What is more difficult but essential is to review the system as a whole and to define--then insure--the conditions of its survival. You are doing this, Although these are positive signs of your progress, I do have two</p>
<p>recommendations:</p>
<p>- First, I would like to see the pace of the Board pick up, To date you have issued only five cost accounting standards, and work is underway on an additional twelve or so areas, I had hoped you would be further along by now, You must guard against a tendency to study issues to death, Thought without action is not worthwhile, There are many who would like nothing better than to see you tied up on issues which are not central to your work,</p>
<p>- Second, you must not be overly concerned by complaints from industry. Industry will never be satisfied. Their Opposition is compulsive and there is little reason for you to be overly persuaded by the predictable tone of anguish, no matter what your position might be.</p>
<p>I am not an accountant, Nor am I prepared or qualified to debate the various theories put forth by accountants and industrialists. You are all experts in accounting and well versed in the traditional arguments. The accountants have had many years to wrestle with these questions and they often end up settling on whatever method of depreciation has been accepted for tax purposes, When I first talked with you shortly after the Board was formed</p>
<p>in 1971, I said that a major accomplishment of the Board would be to establish</p>
<p>profit contractors actually make in producing it,</p>
<p>A significant potential for distortion of Cost stems from use of tax rules regarding method of depreciation and useful life of equipment, We all know that the tax rules result from a political process which considers Social goals, financial incentives and other factors, These tax rules are</p>
<p>inappropriate for Cost accounting. Mr, Staats made that point clearly in</p>
<p>on defense work, The first point is that competition in defense procurement is the</p>
<p>exception, not the rule. Ninety percent of the defense procurement budget</p>
<p>y cannot expect competitive behavior in an industry which does not have a</p>
<p>&quot;competitive Structure, So, in setting a standard for the defense industry, ‘ you cannot presume that competition is an effective restraint on the contractors’ financial decisions, such as those involving how fixed assets will be depreciated.</p>
<p>Your letter inviting me to this session included the statement that defense contractors use accelerated depreciation methods much more than those in commercial business, I think it is often to their benefit to do so. In a non-competitive business such as the defense industry, where profit is based on estimated cost, the contractor is less constrained, The higher the cost, the higher the profit and, in the case of depreciation, the greater the cash flow. Profit should be the result, not the objective of efficient management , but many defense contractors do not appear to understand this,</p>
<p>This brings me to my next point: Defense business today is concentrated among a few large contractors, many of which are Conglomerates. Conglomerate policies on investment and cash flow have a major impact on depreciation policy. In many cases, they are reluctant to invest profits in new and improved facilities as long as higher maintenance costs can be passed to the Government, They do their best to increase return on investment by reducing investment in facilities, When forced to invest in new facilities, the higher depreciation costs under accelerated methods of depreciation help free up cash which can be used to acquire other firms or invest in other business ventures,</p>
<p>These pressures--minimized investment and increased cash flow--have little</p>
<p>to do with legitimate costs of defense work. And these pressures will not</p>
<p>go away under conditions of limited competition, If we are to ascertain the legitimate costs of defense work with regard to depreciation, the cost accounting standard must require contractors to base depreciation policy on more</p>
<p>realistic service lives and on the actual rate of use or deterioration, rather</p>
<p>than on providing some artificial set of financial incentives.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example which illustrates the relevance of the two issues I have raised--lack of competition, and volume of defense business in the hands of conglomerates . Several years ago We tried to compare the cost of Poseidon submarine conversions at two major shipyards, Since these contracts were negotiated with profit as a percentage of estimated cost in a non-competitive situation, we found that the contractors were not paying much attention to reducing costs, In fact, the higher cost contractor was making the most profit, He had no incentive to improve his facilities or control their cost of maintenance to make them more efficient, For several years his investment in facilities had been declining while his maintenance costs were increasing dramatically. The higher costs provided him a higher profit base. He could get away with this in defense business because there was little effective competition to hold prices down; we had to use both shipyards for the conversions and they both knew it, It is not surprising that under such conditions, cash flow and investment considerations outweigh those of efficiency and economy .</p>
<p>In case after case, We find contractor top management far removed from the day-to-day operations of the company, They are preoccupied with numbers at the bottom of a profit and loss statement and with how much cash they can generate from the operation. Those who do well by these standards are rewarded, When the manager runs into trouble, he is under great pressure to take advantage of whatever accounting flexibility there is at his disposal to portray his results in the most attractive possible terms, regardless of the impact on cost on Government work, Is it any wonder then that he focuses most of his attention on the financial aspects of the job?</p>
<p>This is where your depreciation standard comes into play.</p>
<p>Let me now discuss two key issues on depreciation: Physical deterioration</p>
<p>of assets and the issue of service life. I have heard contractors advance</p>
<p>three major arguments for acceptance of accelerated depreciation. One is</p>
<p>that equipment is consumed at a faster rate during earlier years of life, with the corollary that output declines later in life or that maintenance costs must increase and effectively offset the reduction in depreciation in later years. The second argument is that accelerated depreciation is a way of compensating defense contractors for the high risk inherent in the business. Finally, contractors argue that accelerated depreciation enables them to modernize plant, using the increased cash flow for investment in new plant,</p>
<p>I am involved primarily in manufacturing work where heavy machine tools are used, I have not observed the phenomenon of these machine tools wasting away faster in the early years, On the contrary, it is not at all unusual to find precision machine tools actively in use 30 to 40 years after they</p>
<p>have been acquired,</p>
<p>I checked and found that every five years American</p>
<p>Machinist publishes an inventorv of machine tools in the United</p>
<p>States. The results of the 1973 inventory have just been published. It shows that two-thirds of all machine tools in use by American industry are over 10 years old--28 percent are over 20 years old, Another revealing statistic is that three major types of metal working machinery--turning, boring and drilling machines--have been getting relatively older for the past 30 years, For example, 66 percent of boring machines were under 10</p>
<p>years old in 1945, at the end of</p>
<p>World War II, This was because of the large expansion of industry in the</p>
<p>preceding five years, Now only 30 percent are less than 10 years old,</p>
<p>These statistics on age of equipment in the United States machine tool</p>
<p>inventory compare with Internal Revenue Service &quot;guideline lives&quot; of 12 years</p>
<p>and IRS &quot;asset depreciation range'' minimum of 9-1/2 years for companies in</p>
<p>the &quot;metal fabricating industry.'' The comparison shows Clearly that the</p>
<p>actual service lives of machine tools in the United States far exceed the service lives accepted for tax purposes,</p>
<p>The statistics on age of the machine tool inventory are backed by my experience. Rarely do I see contractors disposing of capital equipment at the end of guideline life, This would be wasteful. No contractor buys equipment he expects to be unable to use over a Significant period of time, Of course, at some point, if a machine is used long enough, wear and tear make it less able to hold tolerance for precision work; errors in machining then increase the amount of rework and thus reduce output,</p>
<p>But this phenomenon rarely occurs within the shorter service lives over which the equipment can be depreciated today and certainly not in the short time</p>
<p>it takes to charge off the major part of the cost of an asset using accelerated depreciation,</p>
<p>The argument advanced by contractors that accelerated depreciation is necessary in consideration of risks in defense business is not valid in my view, More often the risks in defense work are greatly exaggerated, As I mentioned earlier, there is little effective Competition for complex military equipment to drive prices down. Most complex defense equipment is procured under cost-reimbursement or incentive-type contracts under which the Government bears a substantial portion or all the risk of cost overruns,</p>
<p>From press accounts, you know that large defense contractors faced with</p>
<p>financial problems often have been able to obtain financial assistance from</p>
<p>the Government through claims, contract repricings, guaranteed loans and ~ like.</p>
<p>The so-called market risks in defense procurement are also often exaggerated, In many cases, contractors perform major Government work in profit centers which are more certain of a continued market than are comparable profit centers in the competitive commercial world. Defense industry representatives often talk about the high degree of technological obsolescence in defense business. It is true there have been significant technological advancements in weapon systems themselves, but my experience has been that these advancements seldom make production facilities obsolete, In the majority of cases, components of new weapon systems can be manufactured using general purpose machine tools and production methods. Some items of specialized test equipment may become technologically obsolescent before the end of physical life, but in many cases these are not capitalized, I think you will find that most defense work is performed on general purpose machine tools which do not have a high degree of technological obsolescence and which can be used on defense or non-defense work to the end of their physical life, The concept of excessive market risk is not applicable for most large defense contractors,</p>
<p>Accelerated depreciation methods are based on cash flow, not risk. The contractor wants prompt cash flow. The procurement regulations allow it, and he would be foolish not to claim it. But, cash flow considerations are not a sound basis for determining cost. I suggest that the Board should not accept as cost, depreciation amounts that are not in line with the</p>
<p>expected rate of consumption of the asset,</p>
<p>Accelerated depreciation has not been an effective incentive to modernize</p>
<p>defense plants either. Often, in non-competitive situations, contractors</p>
<p>can optimize their cash flow and profits by not investing in capital improve- ments, Conglomerates can use the cash flow generated in their defense oriented divisions to finance other corporate activities, In such cases the defense work may absorb the high cost of accelerated depreciation, but the contractor uses the proceeds for non-defense work. On non-competitive defense work, contractors may continue to operate older equipment beyond the point where</p>
<p>it is economical to do so because they can pass on the higher costs to the Government through contract prices, I mentioned earlier that, since profits</p>
<p>on defense contracts are negotiated as a percentage of estimated costs, the</p>
<p>higher costs may actually result in higher profits in the long run,</p>
<p>The problem of unlimited repair and maintenance costs also needs attention, One approach would be to put limits on the allowability of repair costs, Another would be to exclude repair costs from the base on which profits are figured, But these are beyond the scope of this Board, What you can do is require contractors to account for repair costs in a way which will enable procurement officials to make judgments on reasonableness and refuse reimbursement for excess repairs unless adequate explanation is provided, I find that some defense contractors do not even keep cost records adequate to show when maintenance costs on major items of equipment have become excessive,</p>
<p>Some contractors also argue that, in an inflationary economy, fast write-offs generate the cash necessary to buy replacement equipment at higher price levels in later years. Obviously, in a period of rising prices, replacement equipment will cost more than the original, But the question before the Board is what is cost. It seems to me that depreciation</p>
<p>cost should be whatever you actually paid for the asset rationally prorated</p>
<p>r its useful life, The question of how contractors might finance possible F future plant and equipment acquisitions is a separate issue which should not be factored into cost calculations on current contracts.</p>
<p>With regard to service life, I have noted that two-thirds of machine tools in the United States are over 10 years old. Yet service life &quot;guidelines&quot; used by the IRS permit equipment to be depreciated over shorter periods in many cases, For example, in the case of horizontal and vertical boring mills, the bread and butter equipment of many large manufacturing operations, IRS rules permit the asset to be depreciated over a period of as little as 9-1/2 years by companies in the metal-fabricating industry. This is too short a life for such equipment,</p>
<p>There is also the issue of uniformity and comparability between two companies with the same type of assets, As I understand the present cost accounting Situation, which is based on IRS rules, there is no requirement</p>
<p>that plants doing identical work should use similar depreciation charges.</p>
<p>For example, several years ago one of our suppliers decided to invest in more machine tools, He proposed to depreciate them over an eight year life rather than the 12 year life other suppliers doing identical work, had told us was the minimum service life accepted by IRS for that type of equipment, He assured us the eight year life was acceptable under IRS guide- lines, We checked and found that apparently he was right. The difference between the eight year service life he could use and tne 12-year life used by other manufacturers is that his parent corporation was classified in a different industry grouping where a more favorable &quot;guideline&quot; was available to him than to his competitors. Under procurement regulations, he could use</p>
<p>the shorter service lives,</p>
<p>A second example concerns a private shipbuilder who, under IRS rules, was writing off the cost of a dry dock in 12 years. In contrast, another shipyard in the same line of work was depreciating its dry dock on a straight line basis over 40 years. As a result depreciation charged on identical jobs done by each shipyard varied significantly--$200,000 per year for the company using straight line over a more realistic life, and $1.2 million for the company proposing accelerated depreciation over a very short life, There is little wear to a dry dock and it is not uncommon to find dry docks 50 or 100 years old still in use. In this case, we finally got the company to agree to write the dry dock off over a 20 year life for contract purposes, but this is still much less than its economic life.</p>
<p>Accountants permit the two managements to make different estimates of service life and to use different methods of assigning the cost over the different time periods. With that kind of ''flexibility,'' how do you expect a program manager to make sense out of cost estimates from two contractors?</p>
<p>I appreciate the difficulty of establishing accurate service lives, yet it should be done. You ought to be able to devise simple statistical tests whereby those contractors who continually understate service lives are required to make longer estimates for their write-offs. Since standards for useable lives should be uniform there may be cases where equipment will have longer or shorter lives than what is established in your standard, For the sake of equity, the Board probably will have to lean toward underestimating actual economic lives, Even so, if you are to arrive at a depreciation standard that fairly represents actual costs, realistic lives for depreciable</p>
<p>equipment should be substantially longer than presently permitted by IRS</p>
<p>for tax purposes, I hope you will provide rules that make similar circumstances</p>
<p>lead to similar depreciation charges,</p>
<p>I wish I could express complete confidence in contractors and their</p>
<p>accountants on the question of service life, But they do not appear to be trying to estimate actual service lives, Contractors are trying to justify short lives, and the public accountants seem to condone the practice. Accountants have a mania for measurement--the uncertainty is the yardstick they use, All too often their sophisticated calculations are based on simple false assumptions,</p>
<p>Let me summarize my main points:</p>
<p>1, tax rules are not adequate for cost accounting in depreciation of fixed assets;</p>
<p>2. the absence of effective competition in much of the defense industry results in depreciation charges based mainly on the desire for prompt cash payment;</p>
<p>3, ‘there is no justification in my experience for accelerated depreciation as the basis for cost accounting;</p>
<p>4. there is no evidence that machines deteriorate at a rate even approaching their depreciation under an accelerated method;</p>
<p>5, comparability between contractors doing similar work should be required; and</p>
<p>6. you should face up to the issue of service life, and establish standards which come closer to actual service life than the current tax</p>
<p>regulations.</p>
<p>These are important issues which deserve your careful attention, Never- theless, the work of this Board must also be viewed in a broader perspective: it must include the role of accounting and the role of business in our society. We are faced today with the large question of which type of society, the totalitarian or our democratic capitalist one, will predominate,</p>
<p>The totalitarian ethic is based upon the assumption of a sole and exclusive truth, It postulates a preordained harmonious and perfect scheme of things to which men are presumed to be irresistably driven,</p>
<p>Our system finds the essence of freedom in spontaneity and in the absence of coercion; theirs believes it will be realized only in the pursuit and attainment of an absolute collective purpose. The aims of our system cannot be realized through coercion. We consider the use of force for their</p>
<p>realization to be an evil. We believe that in the absence of coercion we will one day reach, through a process of trial and error, a state of harmony, Public opinion polls reflect the low regard in which the people hold business in America, These polls indicate an increasing public cynicism about the capacity of business to put its house in order. Our capitalist system is under attack, In large areas of the world it is no longer used, Elsewhere, such as in parts of Western Europe, it has become subject to extensive Government control, ‘ I believe in our Capitalist system. I believe in competition, Business</p>
<p>has a right to and should make a profit, It is to their best interest to</p>
<p>avoid practices for which hey have rightly been criticized. Business must</p>
<p>not ignore its shortcomings nor attempt to explain them away.</p>
<p>Should our capitalist system be destroyed, it will be accompanied by the destruction of most of our liberties. Therefore, for its own good as well as for the good of the people of our country, business must put its house in order.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;profession&quot; of accounting, because of its active participation, must share the blame for the state of our business morality. The difficulty in obtaining reliable and consistent information from company annual reports--with their calibrated phrasing--is but one example, A calling, to merit the name of &quot;profession&quot; must live up to a code of ethics and enforce that code on its members. On these terms, is accounting a profession? Accounting is presently self-governed, not because of any natural or constitutional right but because of public consent, Society considers itself without the necessary knowledge and expertise to review the quality of professional service or to evaluate professional judgments. If accountants do not start policing themselves the public will withdraw its consent and accountants should not be surprised one day to find an official-looking stranger scouring out their house with a detached and ruthless thoroughness.</p>
<p>I know that the task of the Board is complex, and that my suggestions cannot be adopted easily. Many in Government as well as industry are strongly motivated not to solve the problems they face because the solutions might interfere with their concepts. Some tend to adhere to abstract theory and to ignore imediately relevant problems, Others view solutions as endangering familiar ways of doing things,</p>
<p>As this Board has already demonstrated, it is not so much the ability,</p>
<p>the diligence and the hewing to the problems that are necessary. It is</p>
<p>loyalty, intelligence, perspective, judgment, and selflessness. You must continue to be zealots--not for a cause but for facts and for truth. Today is a time of new beginnings, a time of discovery. But it is also a time for developing better ways of managing what we have and of completing what man has begun, To understand is easy; to do is difficult, We are all imperfect in our endeavors, and we may be forgiven if we have done our best and advanced but little, In the light of the problem of survival of our democratic capitalism as well as our individual liberties, what you are doing serves a large national</p>
