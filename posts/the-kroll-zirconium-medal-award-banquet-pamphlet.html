      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document is the program for The Kroll Zirconium Medal Award Banquet, held on March 21, 1975, at the Brown Palace Hotel in Denver, Colorado. It primarily celebrates Dr. William Justin Kroll, a pioneering metallurgist recognized for developing the &quot;Kroll Process&quot; for commercial titanium production and his work on ductile zirconium for nuclear submarine reactors, who passed away in March 1973. The banquet&#x27;s highlight is an address by Admiral Hyman George Rickover, whose extensive biography details his instrumental role in creating the nuclear Navy, including the development of the USS Nautilus (launched 1954) and the Shippingport Pressurized Water Reactor (operational 1957), the first nuclear-powered electric utility. His career, spanning from his 1922 Naval Academy graduation to his leadership in the Energy Research and Development Administration, is marked by significant awards like the Legion of Merit (1946) and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal (1961), and his contributions to educational reform. The program also lists the various sponsors and the members of the award selection committee.</p>

        <p>PROFILE</p>
<p>Dr. William Justin Kroll was one of the foremost metallurgists of our<br>times. He was a devoted experimentalist with a remarkable ability to<br>ascertain the scientific and industrial significance of results obtained<br>in the laboratory. As a young man, Dr. Kroll was recognized for dis-<br>covering a process to remove bismuth from lead. Later he devised the<br>first commercial process to produce titanitum—the “Kroll Process.” His<br>last large-scale endeavor was a procedure to produce ductile zir-<br>conium; the resulting metal was used in building the reactor for the first<br>nuclear submarine.</p>
<p>Born in Luxembourg, Dr. Krol! received his university training in Ger-<br>many. He worked for the Metallgesellschaft until he established his own<br>research laboratory in Luxembourg. He turned out an astonishing series<br>of metallurgical developments on such diverse subjects as beryllium<br>production, age-hardenable alloys, vacuum metallurgy, and especially<br>the production of titanium by the reduction of chloride with magnesium.</p>
<p>With the start of World War II, he moved to the United States, working<br>for 4 years with Union Carbide in Niagara Falls and then transferring<br>to Oregon as consultant to the U.S. Bureau of Mines. He lived for many<br>years in Corvallis, Oregon, before returning to Europe, where he built<br>a house in a suburb of Brussels to be near his brother, Theodore.</p>
<p>W. J. Kroll died in March 1973; he was never married but he left a host<br>of friends and admirers.</p>

<p>ADMIRAL HYMAN GEORGE RICKOVER<br>U.S. Navy</p>
<p>In addition to his contributions to the development of the nuclear Navy,<br>Admiral H. G. Rickover also led the scientific, technical, and industrial<br>team which developed and constructed the first nuclear-powered elec-<br>tric utility in the United States.</p>
<p>Born on January 27, 1900, he attended high school in Chicago, Illinois,<br>before his appointment in 1918 to the United States Naval Academy.<br>He was graduated and commissioned Ensign in June 1922, and after<br>duties afloat, he returned in 1927 to Annapolis for instruction in elec-<br>trical engineering at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Rickover con-<br>tinued the course at Columbia University, where he received the Master<br>of Science in electrical engineering in December 1929.</p>
<p>In 1930 he had submarine training followed by submarine service,<br>then was attached to the Office of Inspector of Naval Material. Sea duty<br>as engineering officer aboard the battleship USS New Mexico came<br>next, then engineering duty at the Navy Yard, Cavite, Philippine<br>Islands,</p>
<p>In August 1939, he was assigned to the Bureau of Ships, Washington,<br>D.C., where he remained throughout the greater part of World War Il.<br>For overcoming tremendous procurement difficulties created by short-<br>ages in materials, manpower, and manufacturing facilities in electrical<br>equipment, he was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1946.</p>
<p>In the latter stages of the war, he served with the Nineteenth Fleet,<br>engaged in ‘‘mothballing” vessels of the Pacific Fleet, and was then</p>
<p>eo +</p>
<p>assigned to the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in the<br>development of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Duties followed in nuclear propulsion and in the design, development,<br>and construction of a nuclear reactor which would drive a naval sub-<br>marine. Under the direction of the Admiral, then a Captain, a land-based<br>prototype for the Nautilus was tested by the Atomic Energy Commis-<br>ston. For successfully advancing the submarine thermal reactor beyond<br>all expectations, he received a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion<br>of Merit.</p>
<p>On January 21, 1954, the first nuclear-powered submarine, Nautilus,<br>was christened and put to sea, “underway on nuclear power,” on Jan-<br>uary 17, 1955.</p>
<p>He then headed up the team that made possible the Shippingport Pres-<br>surized Water Reactor at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, which became<br>the first nuclear-powered electric utility central station on Decem-<br>ber 2, 1957.</p>
<p>On January 17, 1961, Rickover was presented the Navy Distinguished<br>Service Medal “for his skillful technical direction, unusual foresight,<br>and unswerving perseverance in the field of naval nuclear propulsion;<br>and for his training of the crews and his insistence on high engineering<br>standards in nuclear-powered ships.”’</p>
<p>In 1962, President Kennedy determined that Admiral Rickover, who<br>had reached retirement age, should continue on active duty; President<br>Johnson confirmed this decision.</p>
<p>On February 13, 1964, he received a Gold Star in lieu of a second Dis-<br>tinguished Service Medal for continuing contributions to the Navy,<br>including direction of the effort which developed the Polaris weapons’<br>system and nuclear-powered surface ships, and for his leadership in the<br>field of civilian reactors.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover continues to serve as Director, Division of Naval<br>Reactors, Energy Research and Development Administration, with ad-<br>ditional responsibility as Deputy Commander, Nuclear Power Direc-<br>torate, Naval Ship Systems Command.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, he has spoken and written on the need for<br>educational reform. His first book, Education and Freedom, attracted<br>international attention. His most recent book, published in 1972, traces<br>in biographical essays the impact of the careers of the 41 eminent<br>Americans for whom the Polaris submarines are named.</p>
