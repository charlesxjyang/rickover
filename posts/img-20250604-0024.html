      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document transcribes a March 26, 1969, House Armed Services Committee hearing focused on a critical retention crisis for nuclear-qualified submarine officers, a problem Admiral Hyman G. Rickover had long highlighted. The central issue is the severe shortage of these highly trained personnel, with figures indicating a 50% resignation rate in certain year groups, 370 total resignations, and an active manning requirement of over 1,400 officers against a total community of less than 2,000, compounded by an inadequate training pipeline (only 600 in training versus 950 needed). To address this, the committee considers H.R. 9328, a bill proposing special pay of up to $3,750 annually for officers agreeing to a four-year service extension, totaling up to $15,000, emphasizing the urgent need to retain these vital experts to ensure the continued manning of Polaris and nuclear attack submarines.</p>

<p>The committee met at 10:10 a.m., in room 2118, Rayburn Hou:<br>Office Building, the Hon. L. Mendel Rivers, chairman of the con<br>mittee, presiding.</p>
<p>The Crarrman. Let the committee come to order,</p>
<p>Before we begin our deliberations this morning, our distinguishe</p>
<p>\colleague from New Mexico has a very distinguished visitor he want</p>
<p>_/ to present to the committee.</p>
<p>d</p>
<p>I recognize Mr. Foreman of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Foreman, Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>I have with us here in the hearing room this morning a very out<br>standing young lady from Las Cruces, N. Mex., who was Mrs. Nev<br>Mexico, and now she is Mrs. United States Savings Bond.</p>
<p>Her name is Mrs. Joy Berman. She is from Las Cruces. She ha<br>been traveling around the United States—in fact, around the world—<br>promoting United States Savings Bonds, and she has recently beet<br>to Vietnam and Korea and other places, and I am pleased to have he<br>here.</p>
<p>Will you please stand, Joy ? [ Applause. ]</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. We are so happy to have you, and we are so grate<br>ful for the wonderful work you are doing.</p>
<p>I think the committee would be with one accord in my observa<br>tion. You could be Miss United States, you wouldn’t need any other<br>appellation. We are very happy to have you. We congratulate you or<br>the fine work you are doing. It is such a worthy cause.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Foreman.</p>
<p>Mr. Fornman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The Crarrman. Gentlemen, before we get started, our old and<br>esteemed friend, Admiral] Rickover, has something he wants to say<br>to the committee. | hes a</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, we would be very glad to hear from you.</p>

<p>of the agreement by the Secretary or his designee, the total amount payable</p>
<p>shall become fixed and shall be paid in four equal yearly installments, com-<br>_peneing at the expiration of the initial obligated. service; except, the Secretary</p>
<p>‘or his designee may accept the active-service agreement not more than one year<br>in advance of the expiration of the initial obligated active service and the<br>amount may then be paid in five yearly installments, not to exceed $3,000 per<br>year, commencing with the date of acceptance of the agreement.</p>
<p>“(b) No more than one agreement for each officer shall be accepted under<br>this section.</p>
<p>“(¢) Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy and<br>subject to such exceptions as may be prescribed in those regulations, refunds,<br>on a pro rata basis, of sums paid pursuant to this section may be required if<br>the officer having received the payment fails to complete the full period of four<br>years of active submarine service which he agreed to serve.</p>
<p>“(d) Nothing in this section shall alter or modify the obligation of a regular<br>officer to perform active service at the pleasure of the President. Completion<br>of the additional period of four years’ active submarine service under this sec-<br>tion shall in no way obligate the President to accept a resignation submitted<br>by a regular officer at the end of the four-year period.</p>
<p>“(e) The provisions of this section shall be effective only in the case of<br>officers who, on or before June 30, 1973, execute the required written agreement<br>to remain in active service.”</p>
<p>(2) by inserting the following new item in the analysis:<br>«312. Special pay ; nuclear-qualified submarine officers extending period of active service.”</p>
<p>Now, this is a long statement/we have here, and I want you to pay<br>close attention to it, and I will ask Mr. Slatinshek to read it, and I will<br>ask you to pay very careful attention to it.</p>
<p>We wrote this, and I will have something to say when Mr. Slatinshek<br>has completed his reading of it.</p>
<p>I think we are guilty—and this goes for the Navy too—of reacting<br>to conditions that we should have anticipated. We should have antie-</p>
<p>_fpated this, and let’s start a new era of not sitting down waiting for</p>
<p>somebody to hit us before we start these things.</p>
<p>T think Admiral Rickover has been a voice crying in the wilderness<br>on lots of these things.</p>
<p>You, too Admiral Duncan. I know what you have done about things<br>like this.</p>
<p>But we have a new manpower team now. I know of no better one to<br>head it than General Hittle. It shows how they are meeting these prob-<br>lems head on, and that is the only way to do this, and for this we want<br>to thank you and congratulate you.</p>
<p>But let’s see if we can’t plan this morning to avoid these crises, which<br>are inevitable, if we don’t see them. And there are others coming just<br>like this; let’s get ready for them.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Mr. Slatinshek.</p>
<p>Mr. SLatinsiex. This isthe chairman’s statement, and I read:</p>
<p>Our principal purpose in meeting today is to consider H.R. 9328, a<br>bill which, if enacted into law, will authorize the Secretary of the Navy<br>to pay a substantial monetary bonus to certain nuclear trained sub-<br>marine officers who voluntarily extend their period of obligated service.<br>- Tand other Members of the Congress have for the past several months<br>been concerned over disquieting rumors that the Navy was experienc-<br>ing genuine difficulty in retaining nuclear-trained submarine officers.<br>Subsequent inquiries made by me revealed that there was indeed a<br>serious problem which could, among other things, preclude us from ade-<br>quately manning our Polaris submarines.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Chairman, I have here a gavel which<br>made from wood from the U.S.S. Constitution. I know of no on<br>whom it would be more appropriate to present this than to you,<br>cause the Constitution was made of oak, and I believe your attit<br>is one which reflects the firm oak tree, which is protecting our cc<br>try. And therefore I would like to present this to you for all the thi<br>you have done for the United States.</p>
<p>T know that as a Congressman you, with all other Members of C<br>gress, must look out for your district. If you didn’t, you woul:<br>come back here. Every Congressman has to do that.</p>
<p>But on top of that, you have preeminently in your mind the wel:<br>of the United States, and you also know the first duty of a legislatc<br>to protect his country and keep it alive. It is in this spirit I would<br>to present this gavel.</p>
<p>The Cuatrman. Thank you very much, Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>Admiral, I certainly accept this in the spirit in which it was gi<br>and surely by the magnificent and gracious remarks which actu:<br>your bringing it here.</p>
<p>I accept it for myself, in great appreciation, but I accept it too<br>the committee, for the things for which this committee stands, and<br>backing they are always giving the program of this committee whe<br>is outlined by our policy committee.</p>
<p>I shan’t take this home, but I will leave it in this committee rc<br>remembering your words. We must be sturdy in these times, like<br>Constitution of the United States, and the ship from which this g<br>was made. We will cherish this and we will preserve this, and it<br>remain with the committee.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we are convened this morning for the purpose of |<br>sidering H.R. 9828.</p>
<p>[H.R. 9328, 91st Cong., first sess.]</p>
<p>A BILL To amend title 37, United States Code, to provide special pay to naval |<br>qualified in submarines, who have the current technical quslifvation for duty fe<br>nection with supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion, p)<br>who agree to remain in active submarine service for one period of four years be<br>any other obligated active service, and for other punposes.</p>
<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United &amp;<br>of America in Congress assembled, That chapter 5 of title 37, United States (<br>is amended—</p>
<p>, (1) by adding the following new section :<br>$312. Special pay: nuclear-qualified submarine officers extending perio<br>active service</p>
<p>“(a) Under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy<br>officer of the naval service who— : :</p>
<p>“(1) is entitled to basic pay ;<br>(2) is currently designated ‘qualified in submarines’ ;<br>“(3) has the current technical qualification for duty in connection<br>supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion ple<br>(4) has not completed ten years of commissioned service; and<br>“(5) executes a written agreement to remain in active submarine 8<br>for one period of four years in addition to any other period of oblis<br>active service,<br>may, upon the acceptance by the Secretary or his designee of the written a:<br>ment, in addition to all other compensation to which he is entitled, be pe<br>sum of money not to exceed $3,750 for each year of the active-service agreer<br>The Secretary of the Navy shall determine semiannually the necessity for<br>tinuance of the special pay and the rate of special pay per year for such ac<br>service agreements accepted within each six-month period. Upon. accept</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>The Navy, as of early February 1969, had in hand a ‘total of 370</p>
<p>_esignations from regular, nuclear trained submarine officers, plus 44</p>
<p>scheduled releases from Active Duty Reserve officers. Resignation rates<br>from these nuclear trained officers in year groups 1961 through 1964<br>approach, 50 percent, with new resignation requests being received at a<br>rate of approximately 30 per month.</p>
<p>The Navy tells me that 300 nuclear submarine officers are scheduled<br>for release from active duty in calendar year 1960, and if present<br>resignation deferral policy (1-year delay) were relaxed, at least 100<br>more would be released.</p>
<p>This alarming resignation rate becomes more meaningful when we<br>realize that most of these resignations are coming from relatively<br>junior officers who represent the only possible source for future depart-<br>ment heads and commanding officers for our nuclear attack and Polaris<br>submarines.</p>
<p>These are the circumstances which have resulted in the legislative<br>proposal which we have before us today. It is not the only action being</p>
<p>taken by the Navy to cope with this problem, but it represents, in the -</p>
<p>judgment of the executive branch, the most expeditious and meaningful<br>short-term solution to the retention problem.</p>
<p>CORRECTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION</p>
<p>In addition to requesting approval of authority to provide a con-<br>tinuation pay bonus to nuclear-trained submarine officers, the Chief<br>of Naval Operations, after meeting with his subordinate commanders<br>and the Chief of Naval Personnel, has initiated a number of other</p>
<p>administrative actions which hopefully will somewhat alleviate the<br>problem.</p>
<p>Among the steps taken are an effort to reduce substantially the ad-<br>ministrative burdens and paperwork heretofore confronting officers<br>in the nuclear program, as well as an intensified recruiting effort to<br>secure new qualified applicants for the program.</p>
<p>Our witnesses today can, of course, elaborate on these efforts made<br>by the Navy.</p>
<p>The bill before us would provide the Secretary of the Navy with<br>authority to pay a continuation pay bonus to nuclear qualified sub-<br>marine officers who have not completed 10 years of commissioned<br>service, and who agree to voluntarily extend their period of active<br>service.</p>
<p>The bonus will ordinarily be payable to these nuclear submarine<br>officers upon completion of their first sea tour—in return for a 4-year<br>active service commitment. The bonus, however, will be payable to<br>every nuclear-qualified submarine officer with less than 10 years of<br>commissioned service providing he had agreed to remain in the active<br>submarine service for one period of 4 years beyond his obligated<br>perod of service. The bonus can in no case exceed $3,750 for each<br>year of the active service agreement, with a maximum therefore of<br>$15,000 for the 4-year period.</p>
<p>The bill provides that this authority “shall be effective only in the<br>case of officers who, on or before June 30, 1973, execute the required<br>written agreement to remain in active service.” In other words, unless</p>
<p>_yve in the Congress act to extend the availability of this authority</p>
<p>554</p>
<p>The Navy is now acutely conscious of this problem and thered<br>has initiated a number of actions which hopefully will alleviate |<br>problem. Included among these actions is the decision to ask Cong:<br>to authorize the payment of a special monetary bonus to retain nucl<br>trained submarine officers who voluntarily extend their period<br>obligated service.</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p>The current nuclear submarine officer manning problem is a proc</p>
<p>of both inadequate input into the program combined with insuffic<br>retention of trained personnel. These factors result in a decrease<br>trained officer inventory, while ship manning requirements continu<br>increase.<br>_ The nuclear submarine officer community is relatively small, cons<br>ing of fewer than 2,000 officers. Of these, approximately 1,950 offic<br>1,850 are in the grade of commander and lesser grades, and there:<br>are of appropriate seniority for continued. service in nuclear :<br>marines. Approximately 950 of these officers are in the grade<br>lieutenant.</p>
<p>These officers currently man and operate 82 Polaris crews</p>
<p>SSBN’s), and 47 nuclear attack (SSN) submarine crews. Nine n<br>SSN’s will be manned prior to June 30, 1970, requiring additi:<br>personnel.<br>_ The manning of these nuclear powered submarines requires ar<br>imum of 11 nuclear-trained submarine officers per crew. Thus, n<br>than 1,400 officers are required to actively man the nuclear pow<br>submarines presently in our inventory, leaving very few officers<br>assignment to hard core shore and staff billets&#x27;as well as refresher ty<br>ing 1n the program.</p>
<p>Moreover, this very austere inventory of trained officers precl:<br>the Navy from providing this officer community with the norma:<br>to shore rotation opportunity that is afforded their surface con<br>poraries. This circumstance alone contributes heavily to the ‘cur<br>retention problem. For example, there are officers in this program<br>have not been assigned to a shore billet in more than 18 years—a t<br>incredible situation.</p>
<p>The nuclear submarine program because of its sophistication<br>highly technical nature requires officers of the highest possible cal<br>These officers, all volunteers, once accepted into the program, are g<br>intensive specialized training in both nuclear propulsion as we<br>submarine training. The total training period encompasses a peric<br>approximately 2 years.</p>
<p>T am told that despite the best efforts of the Navy, it has heretc<br>been unable to achieve the necessary input into the training pip<br>of approximately 475 officers each year .Thus, the current 2-year t<br>ing pipeline has an inventory of only 600 officers in training, wher<br>requirement of 950 (475 per year) is necessary to insure mainten<br>of adequate qualified officer inventories.</p>
<p>As I had previously indicated, the inability of the Navy to ol<br>enough qualified volunteers for training in the nuclear program -<br>coupled with a drastic decrease in the retention rate, has now res<br>in the problem we are discussing today:</p>
