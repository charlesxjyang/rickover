      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his remarks at the 1974 dedication of Rickover Hall at the United States Naval Academy, Admiral H. G. Rickover expressed his profound honor at having the engineering complex named after him, particularly valuing his inclusion among other distinguished naval leaders like Bancroft, Maury, and Mahan who also have buildings dedicated in their name. A core theme of his speech is the philosophy that all human achievement, including the naval nuclear power program, results not merely from individual effort but primarily from &quot;associative effort&quot; and the collective contributions of many. Rickover explicitly acknowledged the dedicated men and women whose efforts brought the nuclear Navy to fruition, and extended his gratitude for the firm support he received throughout the nuclear ship program&#x27;s history from Congress and the Atomic Energy Commission, as well as more recent support from Secretary Warner.</p>

        <p>&quot;)At Remarks of Admiral H. G. Rickover, USN at the Dedication of Rickover Hall at the United States Naval Academy March 29, 1974</p>
<p>Thank you Secretary Warner.</p>
<p>I am deeply honored to have this engineering complex named after me. It is a special honor to be included in the same company with the illustrious naval leaders for whom buildings have been named at the Naval Academy—men such as Bancroft, Maury, Dahlgren, Isherwood, and Mahan. I am grateful to be considered among them.</p>
<p>I have always felt that in honoring a person we must remember that all human achievement flows not only from individual effort but from associative effort as well. We, the living, are heirs to all the ideas and accomplishments of every human being who has ever lived. This is as true in the naval nuclear power program as it is in other endeavors.</p>
<p>In accepting this honor, I want to acknowledge the efforts and accomplishments of all of the dedicated men and women through whose collective achievements the nuclear Navy has been realized. I especially acknowledge the firm support that I have received from Congress and the Atomic Energy Commission during the entire history of the nuclear ship program and, in recent years, from Secretary Warner.</p>
<p>Thank you Mr. Secretary; I am grateful for this honor, and</p>
<p>particularly for the warm and kind thoughts that are behind it.</p>
