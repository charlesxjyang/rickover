      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a February 1959 speech to the North Carolina State College Union, VADM H. G. Rickover, a key figure in naval nuclear propulsion, underscored the vital link between national competence, technological progress, and a robust education system in a democracy. Drawing from his experience developing nuclear reactors for the Navy, he highlighted the demanding standards required for atomic energy, criticizing an &quot;educational lag&quot; in the U.S. that led to extended &quot;lead times&quot; compared to Russia. Rickover passionately advocated for a fundamental overhaul of American education, arguing against an &quot;easy subject&quot; curriculum and vocational training in favor of a rigorous, liberal education for all citizens. He asserted that a well-educated populace, capable of critical thought and understanding complex scientific and technical issues, is essential for a functioning democracy and for the nation to maintain its global standing, citing figures like Montesquieu and Jefferson to support his views on the necessity of widespread, high-quality education.</p>

        <p>Remarks prepared by VADM H. G. Rickover, USN, Assistant Director for Naval Reactors, Division of Reactor Development, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and Assistant Chief of the Bureau of Ships for Nuclear Propulsion, Navy Department, for delivery at a Forum sponsored by North Carolina State College Union, Raleigh, North Carolina, February 17, 1959.</p>
<p>I am delighted to be here, in the home territory of my good friend, the Honorable Carl Durham, and to speak to his many friends in North Carolina. I should like first to pay tribute to the Congressman and to his colleagues on the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy. The members of this Committee have an understanding of the technical aspects of nuclear fission and a grasp of the potentialities of atomic energy for naval propulsion today and for civilian power production tomorrow that is most unusual among laymen; it is unusual even among engineers! Their mastery of the complicated subject over which they exercise legislative supervision is not, in my opinion, matched by any other committee of the Congress. We are fortunate to have men in the Congress who possess the vision to look beyond the present power and affluence of our country to the needs of the future, and who are prepared to take action to meet these needs in time.</p>
<p>Nuclear reactors are, of course, but one of the many aspects of atomic development with which the Committee concerns itself. I speak from personal experience when I say that without the support that its members have unfailingly given to my group, conversion of our fleet to atomic energy would have been delayed and might have come too late to be of any practical use to the United States.</p>
<p>I hope that Mr. Durham will not consider me presumptuous if I say that when the members of the Committee began their work--a dozen or so years ago--they knew as little about nuclear physics and engineering as I then did. We are, so to speak, classmates for we began to work with nuclear energy about the same time. The Committee was given the unusual task of presiding over the birth of a power revolution that will doubtlessly have far-reaching effects equal to, if not greater than, those wrought by the revolutions that ushered in the ages of steam and electricity. I know of no previous case of a congressional or parliamentary committee being charged with responsibility for overseeing a similar enterprise. To carry out their assignment, the members of the Committee had to master the equivalent of a college course in a complicated technical subject and do it while carrying on their regular work. Similarly, we in the naval nuclear propulsion group had to learn this whole new subject through practical experience on the job. We kept passing on what we had learned to new members of our group, thus slowly building up a corps of nuclear engineers. The entire reactor program was a bootstrap operation from the start. Work, study, and teaching went on simultaneously. It didn't come easy. Few of us were exactly college age!</p>
<p>The specter of Russia's giant scientific strides lent urgency to our work. We decided to save time by telescoping the procedures usually followed in new engineering projects. As you know, the sequence normally runs from basic research to applied research, to the laboratory or &quot;bread-board&quot; model, and finally to the full-scale working model. We skipped the stage when theory is tried out on laboratory or &quot;bread-board&quot; models, and designed our reactors to fit directly into ships and power stations. This was a gamble that we could not have undertaken had we not been fortunate enough to receive the backing of the Joint Congressional Committee. With their support we were able to cut construction time for the first atomic submarine by several years. The NAUTILUS was in fact designed and built within the time usually required for the building of a conventional submarine. Omitting the laboratory model stage did increase our difficulties, however.</p>
<p>To most laymen--and alas even more so to public relations men--a laboratory model always seems to be practically equivalent to the finished, working product. But, this is not so. We have many laboratory reactors; reactors that produce some electricity under ideal laboratory conditions, and much is to be learned from them. There is a world of difference, however, between a research or experimental reactor and one that must actually produce useful power for a naval ship or a utility system. Whereas laboratory conditions favor the new project, reality is troublesome.</p>
<p>It is troublesome because as soon as you move from the laboratory to the practical world you must deal with people outside your own group, over whose qualifications you exercise no control. I use the utmost care in choosing the engineers--naval and civilian--for my own reactor group and I can, therefore, influence the quality of their design work. But for construction of our reactors and of the ships and power stations into which they are to be fitted, we depend on governmental and industrial organizations that do not specialize in atomic energy. Most of their work is with conventional types of ships and power plants. Their managers, as a rule, lack familiarity with the peculiarities of the atom. Therefore, they tend to go about building reactors and nuclear ships in the old and tried ways that were appropriate for conventional jobs. It has taken much time and effort to convince them that nuclear power is a more exacting kind of energy than steam or diesel power. Old established organizations develop undue veneration for routines and protocol and it is extremely difficult for their managers to realize that what suffices for conventional work is quite insufficient for new engineering projects. We had, and still have, the utmost difficulty getting the idea across that technological breakthroughs can never be brought about by routine methods and protocol. The essence of all progress is a shedding of preconceived ideas and accustomed ways of doing things and a venturing into the unknown where one is necessarily guided more by intuition and imagination than by established rules and regulations. How else can anything new be created?</p>
<p>Every attempt to pioneer beyond established techniques has to overcome two sets of problems. Both are the result of an educational lag which leaves us unprepared to cope with the increasing complexities of an ever rising level of technology.</p>
<p>The first set of problems is technical. All who work on design or construction of new engineering projects must be far more rigorously trained in their specialties than may have hitherto been necessary. They must, in particular, be more thoroughly grounded in basic principles. Furthermore, the mere ability to apply these principles routinely which may suffice in performing established engineering tasks does not suffice when engaged in developing a novel project. Only after mastering these basic principles, will they be able to devise the new ways of applying these principles which will make a pioneering project feasible.</p>
<p>The second set of problems is general rather than technical. Those in government and industry who administer or utilize novel engineering projects must be far more competent in their own fields of responsibility. Broader knowledge is also needed by the general public if it is to guide technological progress in a wise and efficient manner. We cannot advance unless we pay the price of progress which is increased competence and ability to think on higher intellectual levels. Education alone--whether formal or self-acquired--will enable us to rise to our new responsibilities and thus to move ahead rapidly.</p>
<p>The atom sets its own categorical imperatives which we have no choice but to accept. Specifically this means that the engineers in my reactor group must perform at higher levels of engineering competence; industry must raise its standards of management and productive accuracy well above those which suffice for routine manufacturing and construction jobs; the officers and men who operate nuclear ships and the personnel who run the Shippingport atomic power station must be far more competent technically than their counterparts in conventional ships and plants. When nuclear reactors enter into domestic or international policies, those in government who have to decide how reactors may be used to the advantage of the United States must have a thorough comprehension of the potentialities and limitations of nuclear power; above all, they must be familiar with the special safety considerations involved in the use of this relatively untried new force of nature.</p>
<p>At the present stage of development, reactors are complex pieces of machinery that cannot be designed, built, or operated except by highly competent persons under rigid safety precautions. Unfortunately, not all the people who exercise control in the reactor field understand this fully. Few indeed realize that one cannot deal efficiently--or even safely--with new and increasingly complex technical developments unless one has himself attained greater technical knowledge and achieved a higher level of human competence. I do not exaggerate when I say that a major part of my own time and that of my top engineers must be diverted from our regular job and devoted to a never-ending battle for higher levels of performance by people outside my own group who make decisions about the building or use of nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>To those of us who have gone through the laborious process of self-education on the job, which is required when one attempts a technological advance, it is self-evident that the need for more rigorous standards of performance is inherent in the nature of atomic energy and has nothing personal about it. In fact, personalities ought never to intrude into technical matters. They do, however, because in this country we place extraordinary emphasis on getting along with people, on conforming to accepted ways of doing things, and on maintaining pleasant social relationships in our business contacts.</p>
<p>Insistence on high standards of performance tends to be regarded as impolite, even rude. One is therefore confronted with the choice between letting standards slide and so failing in one's assigned task, or of incurring personal unpopularity. Of course, if it were generally understood that no new project can be pushed through without exaction of new standards of performance, our demand for higher standards would not be resented. It is ignorance of the complexities of nuclear fission which causes friction and a hostile attitude towards the rigorous specifications we are compelled to exact.</p>
<p>The climb upward is always difficult and painful. It is rendered still more onerous when one must periodically stop and convince reluctant climbers that it is really necessary to reach a higher plateau. Time thus lost in argument shows up in lengthening lead times, that is in prolongation of the period which elapses between conception of a new idea and it utilization in a useful object; as for example, between Einstein's formulation of the equation E = Mc² and completion of the first atomic bomb or nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>The imaginative creativity of the theoretical scientist who deals with abstract concepts is always ahead of the technical and administrative competence of those who translate the abstract into the concrete. How fast we progress technologically depends largely on the time it takes us to put new scientific ideas to practical use. Since the end of World War II, lead times have been lengthening alarmingly in this country--from 2 1/2 years during the war to ten years today. In Russia, meanwhile, lead time on military items is said to have been reduced to but five years. This is a serious matter for we are living in an era when technological progress has become a necessity if we are to deal adequately with the problems arising from population growth and resources exhaustion.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the world situation as it is today, our country must advance rapidly if it is to retain its present position of power. Delay in utilizing new ideas could spell disaster. Anyone familiar with history knows that a slight advantage, grasped and exploited by one side, has often totally altered power relationships. Today changes occur faster than ever before. We can no longer afford the luxury of ignorance of scientific and technical matters which produces delays and lengthens our lead times. Leaders in industry and government must acquire a better understanding of science and its inexorable laws so that they will find it less repugnant to consult technical experts, even those who are their subordinates.</p>
