      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s testimony to the House Appropriations Committee on April 27, 1959, provides a frank assessment of the U.S. nuclear power program, primarily advocating for a significant increase in nuclear-powered attack submarines. He highlights the unparalleled capabilities of existing nuclear submarines, such as the USS Sargo&#x27;s 18,900-mile, 99.5% submerged cruise, the USS Nautilus&#x27;s 8,000-mile trip under the North Pole, and the USS Seawolf&#x27;s 60-day submerged endurance, stating these make conventional submarines obsolete. Rickover warns of the growing Soviet submarine threat, estimating their conventional building capacity at 100 units annually and predicting their imminent development of nuclear submarines, likening the U.S.&#x27;s current antisubmarine warfare (ASW) position to 1941. He also strongly supports nuclear aircraft carriers, despite their initial cost being approximately $120 million more than conventional counterparts, emphasizing their strategic advantages like extended range and reduced logistic support. Finally, Rickover discusses the Shippingport atomic powerplant as a critical experimental facility, noting its current operating cost is eight or nine times that of conventional power but detailing plans for a $20 million upgrade to boost its capacity from 60,000 to 150,000 kilowatts, emphasizing the long-term, non-competitive nature of nuclear power but its strategic importance.</p>

<p>Monpay, aprit 27, 1959. U.S. nuclear power programs</p>
<p>Mr. Sixes. Do you have a statement for us, Admiral ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I do not have a statement. I believe I was to come here to answer such questions as the committee might ask me.</p>
<p>Mr. Sixes. Admiral Rickover, you were invited to come here in order that we might discuss with you the adequacy of the atomic sub- marine program, and to request your suggestions about any inade- quacies that In your mind exist in the naval program.</p>
<p>We would like you to be completely factual and frank with this committee, as you always have been.</p>
<p>We want your personal opinion and not the budget recommenda- tions on this matter.</p>
<p>As you know, any part of this record which cannot be made avail- able to the public is kept for the committee’s use only and not shown to any unauthorized personnel.</p>
<p>T shall open this, Admiral, by asking a few questions.</p>
<p>One, the nuclear propulsion of ships is one area of national defense in which we appear to have built up 2 commanding lead over the Russians. Nuclear power has made the submarine a new weapon, as yet untried in actual warfare. Just how effective would you expect it to be in all-out war? ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would like to answer that question more in the context. of the very first question you asked me, sir, as to what I thought of the adequacy of our nuclear shipbuilding program. think I can develop it better that way, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Stxrs. Very well; proceed please.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I believe our submarine program is adequate for the POLARIS type. It is not, at all adequate for attack subma- rines, and by attack submarines I mean the latest type such as the Skimjack or the Skate.</p>
<p>For the information of your committee, and this is secret, of course, the Skipjack can make knots. We actually made that speed when the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy was on board her 2 weeks ago. That is about as fast as any naval vessel can go, practically.</p>
<p>For example, I have been on a battleship where we were making almost full power, yet on account of the weather and the rough seas we could make only 8 knots, instead of the design full sy d of 21 knots but a submarine operating below the surface can, of course, make her design full speed indefinitely regardless of the weather or state of the sea.</p>
<p>The Skipjack is capable of operating under the ice. She is ca- pable of steaming at full power for about 90,000 to 100,000 miles.</p>
<p>To give you some idea of what our nuclear submarines are doing, let me give you some figures: the Sargo left Mare Island in January and was at sea in the Pacific continuously for 19,000 miles on one cruise. She returned 2 months later having steamed 18,900 miles of that 19,000 miles completely submerged.</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. Would you repeat that?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. The Sargo, on one cruise early this year, cruised 19,000 miles in the Pacific. Of that 19,000 miles, 18,900 were completely submerged.</p>
<p>That is a rather fantastic figure when you compare it with the op- erations of our diesel powered submarines. These submarines run an average of about 18,000 miles per year, at an average speed of about 10 knots; of the 18,000 miles shout 75 percent is on the surface.</p>
<p>The Sargo cruise was about 99.5 percent submerged.</p>
<p>Our nuclear submarines are operating sabmasrged about 75 percent of the time. They are designed to make higher speed submerged than on the surface.</p>
<p>They are also cruising at high powers. The average naval vessel in World War II cruised for about 1 percent of her time at full power.</p>
<p>The nuclear ships are cruising at full power a large part of their time; almost 50 percent in fact, their average power underway is about 50 percent of full power.</p>
<p>The Nautilus, on her cruise from Honolulu to England last August when she went under the North Pole, steamed over 8,000 miles. She was under the polar ice for 1,830 miles.</p>
<p>The Skate about a month ago made a 9,000-mile submerged cruise of which 3,000 miles was under the polar ice.</p>
<p>you know, 71 percent of the globe’s surface, some 140 million square miles of the earth’s surface is ocean, and the area of the Arctic Ocean is about twice that of the United States. The atomic sub- marine is opening up this entire new area for naval warfare.</p>
<p>The Seawolf steamed about 15,000 miles while completely submerged for 60 days.</p>
<p>I could go on quoting statistics of that kind.</p>
<p>There is one other significant statistic. The Navy requires a new conventionally powered ship to steam for only 4 hours at full power for acceptance.</p>
<p>Two years ago I ran the Jand prototype plant for the Mautilus for 66 days and 66 nights continuously at full power. This was far more than any propulsion plant—land, sea, and air—had ever run contin- uously, and a ship with that engine would have gone around the earth twice.</p>
<p>With this introduction, I will now attempt to answer your question.</p>
<p>Soviet submarine 'titreat</p>
<p>I do not believe we are building enough attack submarines. Today it is the best. weapon that we have for destroying enemy submarines. There is no better weapon.</p>
<p>The Russian submarines can come near our coasts. They can fire missiles. If their submarines come off our coast they can drop hydro-</p>
<p>ven or atomic warhead missiles into our cities. One such missile, aceurately placed, could destroy a city.</p>
<p>The best way we know to destroy these submarines is by other atomic-powered submarines.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. The Russian is not firing submerged is he?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Off the record.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. Our REGULUS type?</p>
<p>Admiral Riexover. Of the record.</p>
<p>So far as I know, they do not yet have nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that their automic-powered icebreaker, from what we know of it, which has three atomic engines, will be a forerunner for submarine propulsion. I am certain they would much rather have built a nuclear iobranvine than an icebreaker had they been able to.</p>
<p>With the experience they will get from the icebreaker there is no question in my mind that they will soon have atomic-powered sub- marines, too.</p>
<p>We should do everything possible, while we still have time to ex- ploit the lead we have. We can exploit that lead in two ways. It takes time to build up a nuclear power industry. It also takes time to explore the Arctic; we should be doing that a great deal more than we are now, The nuclear submarines have developed thousands of times as much scientific information about the polar ocean depths in the few cruises they have made in the polar area than have ever been developed before. Here is a large area of the earth, an area about, twice that of the United States, which should be charted as soon as possible so we can learn where to operate and where to hide out.</p>
<p>What nuclear power has really done for the polar regions is to make another large area of the earth insecure and bring it into war- like focus. It has been immune from war up to now, but any nation that possesses nuclear submarines can now use that area for warlike operations.</p>
<p>We have the capacity, right now, with the number of submarine building yards, to build about 10 more nuclear attack submarines a year. Their cost. is approximately $50 million each, Of course, if Congress were to decide to build more of these submarines and tack the cost onto the naval shipbuilding program, that would play havoc with the rest of the naval program,</p>
<p>It has been my opinion for some time that certain elements of our defense should be considered from a national standpoint, whether it is SAC or whether it is certain other new weapons, and not tied specifically to any of the military departments. TI believe we have made a mistake in not doing so. Among the Joint Chiefs of Staff there is naturally a tendency to bargain for each to get something for himself. You cannot blame a man who is on the Joint Chiefs of</p>
<p>Staff for remembering the loyalty that he has to his service, and that he inevitably must have if he is to represent his service. I believe some things should be taken out of the realm of the triservice argu- ment—not only submarines. If I were doing it, I would remove cer- tain items from the departmental budgets and call them national ob- jectives rather than Army, Navy, or Air Force objectives.</p>
<p>Mr. Foon. It is being suggested that POLARIS, being a strategic bomber arm, should therefore be a part of that service which has jurisdiction over strategic bombardment.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would like to answer that question. I do not believe you should take any weapon, whether POLARIS or any other weapon, from the particular service which is developing it until it is fully developed and proved operationally. At that point I be- lieve it would be wise to assign similar types of weapons to one service.</p>
<p>For instance, I could very well envisage that the service—it could be any one of the three—which operates SAC could also operate PO- LARIS, because both have the same mission, but I would not do that until they have proved themselves. That applies to missiles, too.</p>
<p>Mr. Srxes. Admiral, would you tell us to what extent you believe the Russians have the know-how to build nuclear ships? You men- tioned the icebreaker, but you mentioned it only in passing. I would like you to go into more detail on Russian know-how for the construc- tion of nuclear ships.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I can only give you a conjecture based on m personal convictions and intuition. There have been rumors which</p>
<p>1ave ranged all the way from our nuclear submarine effort being de- cried by Russian military papers—saying we really had more, and so on, to rumors that they are building them. I think they are capable of building them. I do not believe that their “backup” industry is as good as ours. That is, we, being an industrial nation with man years of experience, have built up a backup industry, by which i mean we have large numbers of small manufacturers throughout the country that can specialize on specific items.</p>
<p>Today they may not be quite as capable as we are to build nuclear submarines quite so fast as we can, but I do believe they can build nuclear submarines and that it is only a question of time before they will have a nuclear submarine. force.</p>
<p>Mr. Forpv. Why did they pick an icebreaker for their first nuclear- powered ship ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. My opinion is that it is because they could not do it as readily on a submarine. The Russian propaganda is that everything they do is for peaceful purposes, and that we are a warlike nation, whereas everybody in Russia has a dove of peace in his home.</p>
<p>Mr. Foon. I would like to ask this, Admiral, as I should have asked earlier: I am concerned. about the quality, nature, types, and kinds of testimony we get here because of these directives from the Bureau of the Budget, which is one of my pet hates. I just wonder under how many wraps you are appearing under this morning. Are you handcuffed?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. Have you been briefed ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I have not read that directive; consequently, I do not know what instructions there are in it.</p>
<p>Mr. Fxoop. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Does that answer you, sir?</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. I was sure of that. I just wondered whether you</p>
<p>would say so. _ Admiral Ricxover. I have never followed any directive in testify- ing to Congress. Once one of my seniors called me before I was due to testify and told me what his policy was. I said, “Fine. Thank you very much. When I testify I will say that this is what you told me to say.” He said, “Oh, no; you mustn't do that.” I said, “Didn’t you tell me?” Since that time I have never been directed,</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. That applies to this morning ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. If you want to put me under oath, sir, I will state this under oath.</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. No, no. I know. I just want to hear you say so.</p>
<p>Mr. Srxes. Would you foresee there is any possibility that we will lose to the Russians our present leadership in the manufacture of nuclear ships?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We can in a relatively short period of time. As you know, the Russians have a tremendous capacity for manufac- turing submarines, I am sure this has been brought out time and again before your committee. I believe a figure of 100 submarines as their yearly submarine-building capacity has been given you. Once they build the first one, they can build them very fast. In fact, it is quite possible if the Russians made up their mind to build nuclear submarines on a large scale they could soon outstrip us. They may be doing this now because it is known, as has been testified to your com- mittee, that they have given up manu facturing the types of subma- rines they presently have. That could be for one of two reasons: either they are preparing to build a new nuclear type or they figure they have enough of the present ones to do the specific job for which they have planned their submarine fleet. I believe that they do not consider the primary job of their submarines is to destroy commerce so much as it is to prevent our reinforcements reaching Western Europe and to fire missiles into our cities. I am sure they have learned the lessons that the Germans did not learn in two wars. If they are going to engage in an all-out war, they must first defeat the United States or at least make us militarily impotent; that there is no use in their merely winning a victory in Europe because that would simply be a prelude to what they have to do later on.</p>
<p>Mr. Srxes. How would you say we can best utilize our effectiveness m nuclear-powered ships and submarines for national] defense ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would build about 10 more attack subma- rines a year. That is a practicable figure. The cost is not prohibitive. The nuclear part of one of these ships only costs about $12 million. There appears to be a tendency for people to say that.it is the nuclear part that makes these ships expensive. Actually they are not so ex- pensive.</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. I think it would be most helpful for the committee to have the figures for an aircraft carrier, because I and I suspect others believe if we are to have another attack carrier in the budget for 1960, we should have nuclear power in it. Would you mind develop- ing your views on that?</p>
<p>dmiral Rickxover. Of course. I read some of the questions that, at various times, members of this committee have asked the witnesses, from Secretary McElroy on down, “Why didn’t you put in for a nuclear-powered carrier?” I believe testimony was developed before this committee that originally the nuclear carrier had been asked for. Well, the Bureau of the Budget says, “This is the amount of money you can have, and you have to operate within that amount.” You know that as well as I do. This is the essence of the matter. The Bureau of the Budget says: “you can have X dollars.” The Navy wants very much to have a carrier. I do not think it necessary for me to go into the reasons. They have been very well developed over many years before your committee. By carrying out the minimum additional shipbuilding requirements which the Navy has and by dint of making many sacrifices, the Navy will get a conventionally powered carrier, but they cannot get a nuclear carrier because they would have to sacrifice other essential items.</p>
<p>What do you actually save? For the first nuclear carrier the addi- tional cost over an equivalent conventionally powered carrier has been stated to be about $120 million. But you must bear in mind that this figure includes the cost of the nuclear cores. These cores cost more than ——— and they contain the nuclear fuel which will be used to propel that ship. Of course, the nuclear fuel is much higher in eost than oil, but I think we get ourselves confused too much in making these cost comparisons. There was an editorial in the Washington Star day before yesterday, 1 believe, in which General LeMay was quoted as saying that the B-52, our newest bomber, requires six times the amount of maintenance that the World War IL B-17 required. But the B-17 cannot. do today’s job. So the comparison becomes meaningless. If you compare the increased costs for nuclear ships with the increase for other new weapons, I think you will find they are quite a bargain from that standpoint. They are much more expen - sive, of course, but there is not this big increase comparatively that you get for other new weapons.</p>
<p>Take the Skipjack. Mr. Mahon is quite familiar with it, because he has been on board. That type can be built for $50 million. Look what you get for that. $50 million. You get a small task force in itself. The Navy has its large task forees. You have a carrier, and you have a protecting screen. You need lots of people and lots of ships to protect it. The nuclear-powered submarine actually, con- stitutes a small task force all by itself, for instead of having guns for its protection, instead of having other escort vessels, the ocean is its protector.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. And POLARIS?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That. is true of any nuclear submarine, whether it is POLARIS or an attack submarine. Tt carries a small number of men—about 100 to 130, depending on the type. It needs no armor. It stays at sea indefinitely. It needs no supporting forces. It.needs</p>
<p>no tankers. It is a task force by itself. It can hide out under the ice and cannot be discovered. What more do you want?</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. Have you ever made a comparative analysis of the an- nual operating costs of the attack carrier (1) with conventional power and (2) with nuclear power ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There has been such an analysis made, and of course it shows that the nuclear carrier is more expensive to operate. That is quite correct. It is more expensive.</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. Is that true?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir, inevitably, because the fuel cost will be greater. I think the cost of the fuel will be seven or eight times as great. But the Navy expenditure for fuel per year is about 1 per- cent of the total naval appropriation. So what if you go up to 2 percent ?</p>
<p>Think of the military value you get in the lack of tankers and the lack of other logistic support. ‘The nuclear carrier holds almost twice as much jet fuel, which is today the limiting feature in a carrier oper- ation. They can operate only ———— days at full blast with jet planes. If you double that, it means you-have the equivalent of twice as many carriers at the firing point.</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. In other words, you are saying: If you add in the sup- porting costs, this other disadvantage evaporates.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Mr. Ford, you know darned well that to buy an obsolescent ship is stupid. You know that. I am sure every mem- ber on this committee knows that. I do not care what arguments are given to you. What is the purpose of buying a ship—what is the purpose of having any weapon of war that is not the best? Whom are you fooling?</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. Will you yield?</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. Surely.</p>
<p>Mr. Marron. It is said we might not. get the second atomic carrier quickly enough, and in order to have a ship ready for the fleet we have to buy the conventional carrier,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxoyer. | question that very much, sir. Atomic power has been blamed for many things. Take submarines, for example. The record shows we are building them faster than the Navy is build- ing conventional ships. J think that the same thing will prove true of the nuclear carrier that we are now building.</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. Specifically, on the point that we have to have the conventional carrier because, among other things, we must have it on time for operation with the fleet and the second atomic carrier might not be ready. What is your view on that?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. IT do not. wholeheartedly subseribe to that. view- point. We are buying everything for the nuclear plants, not only for the submarines but for the carrier, from three different sources of supply on a 100-percent Jump-sum competitive basis. We have built up these sources of supply, by the way, 100 percent owned by indus- try. We have this capacity. This is one of the things which has not been remarked about much that. I have done in the last 5 years. I have three sources of competitive supply for everything T use.</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. To order a conventional carrier now would be order- ing an obsolescent ship, in your opinion ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Certainly. T think it is just. as much obsoles- cent as if you bought diesel submarines today.</p>
<p>You asked me at. the beginning of this testimony whether I was talking for the Navy or talking for myself. Iam talking for myself, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. Will the gentleman yield.</p>
<p>Mr. Forv. Surely.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. The life of a conventional-type carrier would be about the same ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There is no difference, sir. Twenty years is considered the standard life of a major warship.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. The nuclear carrier would cost approximately $120 million more than the conventional; is that right ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Yes, sir. I stated previously that about of that was the cost of the nuclear cores, the fuel. You cannot just knock off that from the cost. I want to make that clear. It is more expensive to build and operate it, but you have to pay something for having a ship which does more. If you knocked off the cost of that fuel, you would get down to only more for the carrier which is presently being built.</p>
<p>I am trying to answer your question, Mr. Andrews. I have to lead into it this way. What Lam getting at is that the present one is really onl more instead of $120 million more—if you knock off the fuel cost. The Bureau of Ships made a design study for a nuclear carrier unit with four reactors instead of the eight reactors which the present one has. With four reactors we would get a ship whose maxi- mum speed would be about 2.5 knots less, but have all the other characteristics, and we would save about this way.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. My question is this, Admiral: Over the 20-year period which you say is the expected life of each one of the carriers, would the. conventional type be cheaper than the atomic-powered type?</p>
<p>ye amiral Ricxover. Yes. It is cheaper to travel from Chicago to New York by a horse and buggy too. Yes, it is cheaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. Once you put the cores in, you do not have to buy the fuel, do you?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Once you put the cores in, they should last that ship about 5 years; that is, for a 5-year period you would be free of logistic support for propulsion fuel, and you could also carry nearly twice as much aviation fuel.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. I do not think you have answered my question. Over that 20-year period</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The nuclear carrier will cost more. TI see what you are getting at now. Tf you took all these other aspects into ac- count, the building of tankers, the oil storage facilities, and so on, and the reduction in supporting personnel, it might not cost any more, even discounting the additional military advantages you get.</p>
<p>Also, the fuel costs for a nuclear ship will drop as core life in- creases. For this reason, the development of long-lived cores is a major objective of our program. I believe that through increase in the life of nuclear cores, the nuclear fuel cost will be reduced.</p>
<p>Mr. Anprews. That answers my question. In other words, you have a cheaper operating cost. for your nuclear-powered ship over</p>
<p>for the exact same engagement, how many nuclear-fueled ships could we have had and still done the job?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I will try to answer that question, but my an- swer will necessarily have to be rather vague.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrren. I can realize that.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The Navy made a study several years ago about the impact of nuclear submarines in the Atlantic. It was estimated at that time that about nuclear-powered submarines could stop all shipping on the Atlantic. I can visualize if we had about nuclear submarines in the Pacific they would have done two or three times as much damage as all our soli thbe did. That is getting back to what you could have done if you faced knights in armor with bullets. You get into that sort of argument.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrren. Yes, but I was trying to develop that; to compare the cost of one ship with another ship gives an unfair comparison. You can get along with fewer nuclear-powered ships.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. There is no question that, from the point of view of its effectiveness as a military weapon, it is superior on a cost basis. Atomic weapons on a cost basis are all much more effective than any conventional weapons are. There is no question about that.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrren. But if you match their destructive capacity against an equal amount of destructive capacity of the other type, they be- come much cheaper. I was trying to apply that to the nuclear car- rier: how much normal-type operation it would take to equal it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The normal carrier can operate at full power continuously for about miles. The nuclear carrier will oper- ate about miles at full power continuously. Of course, that is the question Mr. Ford and Mr. Sikes were asking about the fuel cost.</p>
<p>Mr. Foon. I lost Mr. Ford’s answer. I heard the figure ——— million. I lost that series of figures.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Let me repeat them.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. What were you trying to prove?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovrr. Let me repeat those figures. The cost of the present nuclear carrier is quoted as being $120 million more than an equivalent conventionally powered carrier. In that $120 million there is included about million for the cost of the nuclear cores. If you knock that off, you get down to a difference of million. If, in addition, instead of using eight cores, which I am using in the present carrier, I use only four improved-type cores—we have made a lot. of developments since we started building the first carrier—I can save more. So even including the cost of the fuel, there would be million differential instead of $120 million differential. If you knocked off the cost of the fuel on the four-reactor carrier, then you havea million differential in the cost.</p>
<p>Cost of nuclear carrier 2% knots slower</p>
<p>Mr. Sixrs. Let me be sure of the statement which you gave us a few minutes ago. I understood you to say if we cut back on the speed about 214 knots we save about million, but is that cutting 214</p>
<p>knois below the speed of the conventional-powered carrier which ig Now proposed 2 Adinival Rickover. Yes, sir; that is correct. Al] carriers, nuclear and otherwise, which are being built generally have about the same speed, within close limits. With the new - our-core carrier there would be a 214-knot reduction in speed. Mr. Suces.” Would that mean it could not keep up with tho task force, Admiral Rickoverr. But the task force is supposed to keep up with the carrier, Mr. Sixes. Do you foresee any major problems in connection with having a 24%4-knot differential ? Admiral Rickovrn. This, sir, is a question which you should prop- erly ask the operating people. I am not competent to answer that. Discussion off the record.) Mr. Sixes. Did you get an answer, Mr, Whitten ? fr. Winrren. Yes, iral Rickover. Your question is hard to answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrren. I know itis. Not that you need any help, Admiral, but I was pointing out a comparison of one ship with another shj might leave unanswered the fact that one ship might be worth three of another kind. So the true comparison would be a nuclear ship as against the same capacity figured in normal ships,</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovenr. [ict me answer that. J believe that logistic Support is going to be an increasingly difficult problem for the Army, Navy, and Air Force from now on. Anything you can do to be self. contained logistically will be a tremendous help to you from now on because the logistic Support requires a rrangements with neutral coun- tries. You are not sure it will be available when you really need it, The whole thing could be a house of eards, Anything we can do to maintain logistic support under U.S, sovercienty is 9 tremendous help, the way the internat ional situation is developing,</p>
<p>don’t think that. you can determine before you build a nuclear ship that it is worth this or that number of conventional ships. ears ago, before the Nautilus Was built, the Navy tried to compare nuclear submarines with conventional ones, but they just couldn't imagine all the advantages of a nuclear submarine before it was ac- tually tried out. None of us could. But. it furned out that the Nautilus is really a new weapon that makes conventional submarines obsolete.</p>
<p>I think we'll probably find much the same situation with nuclear surface ships. There are the facts we have to consider:</p>
<p>1. World oil supplies are dwindling and a continual increase in the price of oil is certain,</p>
<p>2. The availability of oil from one of our principal Sources, the Middle East, is increasi ngly uncertain.</p>
<p>3. The ability of our surface forces to perform their deterrent function and to wage limited war is highly dependent on the uncer- tainty of their location. This uncertainty jis directly related to their endurance at sustained high speed. Nuclear ships have unlimited capability for this; conventional ships do not.</p>
<p>29747—59 —pt. 6——29</p>
<p>4. The ability of our surface. forces to evade submarine action, par- ticularly by nuclear submarines, is also highly dependent on sustained speed. The vulnerability of surface ships while refueling is partic- ularly important in this regard.</p>
<p>5. The ability of our surface forces to wage antisubmarine warfare against nuclear submarines is likewise highly dependent on their ability to stick to the target indefinitely. Conventional ships can’t</p>
<p>O this. Nuclear-powered aircraft</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. Admiral, I want. to get away from the carrier for a minute. When the Air Force people were here, research and develop- ment and aircraft procurement, nearly all of the members of the committee, certainly three or four, were harping on nuclear aircraft. For 10 years we have been talking about that. We are satisfied we are getting no place. So I said to these Air Force people, “I am pretty well fed up with the way you are going about this thing. Suppose I get hold of Rickover and send him over to you, what would you do about it?” First of all, they said they would be glad to have you. .</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That would be a dire fate, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. Now that you are here, what about this nuclear-powered aircraft? I asked them, “What has propulsion to do with the air- frame?” They said the chief problem is propulsion. You are the propulsion man, so why don’t you go over and build them a nuclear airplane?</p>
<p>dmiral Ricxover. First, you would not want me to upset all those Air Force people, would you?</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. Yes, sure.</p>
<p>Mr. Forp. You have had your own troubles.</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. You certainly cannot upset them any more than you have the Navy, so what difference does it make?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The Air Force is a bigger organization. They have more industrial organizations. They have more factories which the Government pays for, more lobbyists.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. Scratch the Air Force. Go and build it for the Navy.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is being worked on now, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. By you?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. I am talking about you. What do you think about it? You think about everything else.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. What do you think about running for Con- gressman from two districts?</p>
<p>Rs Foon. I want to take you out of one. Are you interested in that?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. Is it practical? Is it good? What do you think about it? Youare thenuclear man.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. I have enough troubles of my own, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. I know that.</p>
<p>You are going “chicken” on me.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, I am not going “chicken” on you. What would you want me to do? Would you get up and make speeches about your conferees in Congress from your State?</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. I don’t know anything about this nuclear aircraft. Mr. Boyle and one or two others as ed me particularly about, it. We are always talking about nuclear aircraft. It is a practical thing? Should we have it? I donot know.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. You gentlemen here are the experts in the United States on these matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Froop. I admit that, but now I want to share some of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Srxxs. Please, just a moment. Obviously the Admiral does not feel he wants to get into that discussion. We have a number of pertinent questions to ask him.</p>
<p>Admiral, what is the status of your Shippingport central station atomic powerplant !</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rickover. That station was authorized by Congress in 1953 because there was no full-scale nuclear powerplant underway in the United States. I said at the time I could have it in operation in 1957. We did. We had it running in December 1957, It was de- signed for 60,000 kilowatts of net electrical power. It is running at full power right now. I am not so sure when you get home that some of your electricity does not come from that station, Mr. Flood. It has delivered close to 300 million kilowatt-hours of electrical power since it started.</p>
<p>Mr. Fioop. Don’t say that. Mine isa coal district.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. By using atomic power, as I told you last year, we are conserving coal and your district will last longer.</p>
<p>Mr. Fxoop. I can’t give it away now.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We are designing a new nuclear core for the Shippingport plant which should generate about 150,000 kilowatts of electrical power instead of the present 60,000. We will need money from Congress to do that. We will need a total of about $20 mil- lion; $5 million of that will go for modifications to the nuclear part of the plant, and $15 million to put in more generating capacity.</p>
<p>Mr. Sixes. What is the comparative cost of power generated by nuclear means and power generated by conventional means? Have you any figures on that?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The cost of nuclear power is much higher to- day. It is higher for those plants which are operating. It is low for all plants which have not been built.</p>
<p>Mr. Srxes. I do not understand.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. All plants for which people come in here and ask for appropriations are always cheap, easy to build, and have no problems. The only problem is to get a pad of paper, 8 by 101% inches on which to do the figuring. But when you start building them they become more expensive, they become more difficult, and the power costs more.</p>
<p>Mr. Srxxs. Have you any comparative kilowatt-hour costs ?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. You mean what it is costing us?</p>
<p>Mr. Sixes. Yes.</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. Yes, sir; we have that. It is costing us about eight or nine times as much as conventional power. But we are using the plant as an experimental facility. We are not operating it solely</p>
<p>to generate electricity. It is thoroughly instrumented and we are learning many lessons. The lessons we are learning in that plant are being used by all other designers in the United States and all over the world. So you must consider it as a laboratory facility.</p>
<p>_ Mr. Sixes. What do you project as the future cost, say, in 5 years, in industrial operation ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I will now give you some more undirected testimony. I stated in 1946 that for a period of 10 years thereafter nuclear power would not be competitive, even if the Government gave the fissionable material for free. I stated in 1956 that for the next 10 years the same would apply. I state now, in 1959, that for the next 10 years nuclear power will not be competitive with fossil fuels, coal or oil. You will be given lots of figures by many people, as you have been given for many years, that nuclear power soon will be competitive, but I do not see it, not for a long time.</p>
<p>Mr. Suxes. Are you being given maximum support in your work? I am speaking of the broad program of the development of nuclear propelled naval vessels and the development of the central station nuclear powerplants.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I am being given maximum support by Con- gress particularly. You may get a request for appropriations for two items in my program. One is for the Shippingport reactor. In- stead of spending money for a complete new nuclear plant complex which might run $100 million to $120 million, I can for a total of about $20 million increase the capacity of the Shippingport plant 2% times. That is one item which may come up to your committee. That is presently being considered for authorization by the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy.</p>
<p>Another item is a natural circulation reactor plant for a submarine. That would be a considerable improvement over any submarine re- actor plant we have now. It would eliminate the main coolant pumps. It would eliminate the big check valves and simplify the piping and electrical systems. It would make the ship more reliable. I have adequate research and development money for that purpose. But I need an $18.5-million authorization to construct a land proto- type to try it out. Of this $18.5 million, I need, for the fiscal year</p>
<p>ou are considering, $6 million authorization and $2 million to spend.</p>
<p>hese two items may need your support.</p>
<p>But I would like to say here and now that I have always been treated well by all committees of Congress. I have no complaint. I have no complaint about the amount of money I am getting. I have never asked for more money than I need. At the same time, I do not waste money. If something is not right, I cut it off.</p>
<p>You can get the job done much faster if you do it efliciently. Really, even if the saving of money was not a consideration, you will do the job faster if you do not waste money. Wherever you waste money it takes longer to get the job done. I can tell you this from considerable experience.</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. Admiral, I did not quite get the next step in perfecting the atomic submarine, this new type you are working on.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You went through the Skipjack when you were in New London?</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. Yes.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. As you looked down into the reactor compart- ment, you noticed there were lots of valves and pumps. We can elim- inate a lot of that, which means a considerable reduction in mainte- nance and in difficulties. This is particularly desirable for ships that operate under the ice. The Secretary of Defense has asked the AEC for this. A request for appropriations may be coming to your committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. How long would it take you to develop that sort of submarine? When might it become operational ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I could have the prototype finished and opera- ting in about 214 years if I get authority to go ahead right now.</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. If this works as you think it would, that would be the powerplant type for the future?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir. You see, if we build seven or eight submarines a year, every year I delay I am turning out seven or eight ships which are not as good as they could be.</p>
<p>Mr. Sixes. Are you getting all the support you need from the Navy? You said you were getting maximum support particularly from Congress.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I am getting adequate financial support from</p>
<p>the Navy. As you know, there is a tendency in the Navy to keep me |</p>
<p>from getting involved in various parts of the submarine. It is prob- ably quite natural, but I believe if people in the Navy could forget per- sonality, they might make better use of me.</p>
<p>Mr. Sixes. Mr. Riley, you had a question.</p>
<p>Mr. Ritey. Admiral, when you put this new core into your Ship- pingport plant to produce 150,000 kilowatts instead of 60,069, will that reduce the cost per kilowatt proportionately ¢</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, because the cost of a core is mostly the fabrication cost and we think we can keep that about the same. Yes, sir, it will be a very significant step in the direction of approaching competitive atomic power. It will still not be competitive, and I do not want to leave that impression with this committee. As I said, I do not know of anyone who is realistic, who knows what he is talking about, and who comes to you not with the sole idea of getting appro- priations but also to tell you the facts, who will claim that a nuclear plant is competitive.</p>
<p>Use of nuclear submarines in an'tisubmarine warfark</p>
<p>Mr. Stes. Admiral, if we should find ourselves, in addition to fac- ing an overwhelming number of conventional Russian submarines, also confronted with a rapidly growing number of nuclear Russian submarines, what would be your recommendation about the proper procedure for coping with such a situation ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The only concrete suggestion I can give you now short of finding some easy way to kill nuclear-powered subma- rines, which we do not know, is to have more nuclear-powered subma- rines. I do not know any other way. Today the nuclear-powered sub- marine is the best weapon there is for killing any kind of submarine.</p>
<p>Mr. Mauon. Admiral, if we should have a war of considerable du- ration, my greatest fear in some ways is the threat of the enemy sub- marine. I fear we have not made the progress we should have in antisubmarine warfare, and I think we ought to do more than we are doing in order to try to find a better answer to this problem of anti- submarine warfare.</p>
<p>I realize we could have a war which was an all-out atomic ex- change which perhaps would devastate much of the world in a short time. If we have a war which lasts a considerable length of time and we have to keep the channels of shipping open, I am very much worried about our ability to do that in view of the threat of the sub- marine capability of the opponent. :</p>
<p>I would like your general comments on that overall problem.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I believe you asked this question in previous testimony as to whether we could categorically state we ever caused a Russian submarine to surface.</p>
<p>Discussion off the record.)</p>
<p>dmiral Ricxover. That highlights the point you are making.</p>
<p>I agree with you. I have been in the Navy since shortly after the First World War. I was in submarines between the two wars, I remember the statements then being made that we were overcom- ing the submarine menace. Looking back, it is plain that we were almost dormant in that effort. We did not make much progress between the two wars, and we nearly lost the last war because of that.</p>
<p>My opinion is that, relatively, we are no better off today than we were before 1941. That is, we are in no better position to defeat. to- day’s Russian submarine menace than we were to defeat the German submarine threat in 1941. If fortune favors us and we have the privelege of looking back from the vantage point of 10 to 15 years from now, we probably will find that relative to today’s requirements we are doing no better than we did between the two World Wars— that we have not learned the lesson.</p>
<p>Mr. Manion. Why do we not do better?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. May I talk off the record?</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. Off the record.</p>
<p>(Off the record.)</p>
<p>Mr. Manon. This has been a most interesting discussion,</p>
<p>The language in the bill, which is most important and some of</p>
<p>which will be highly controversial, will be the subject of the hearing</p>
<p>this afternoon. The committee will stand adjourned until 2 o’clock.</p>
