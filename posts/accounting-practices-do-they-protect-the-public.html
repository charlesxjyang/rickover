      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a scathing 1970 address to the Federal Government Accountants Association, Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover passionately argued that federal accountants have largely failed in their duty to protect the public interest, particularly regarding defense contracts. He highlighted the urgent need for uniform cost accounting standards, estimating potential savings of $2 billion annually, and criticized the ineffectiveness of the Truth-in-Negotiations Act (1962) and contract renegotiation due to widespread non-compliance and inadequate accounting rules. Rickover detailed how current practices, including profit calculations based on a percentage of cost and the unchecked growth of conglomerates, lead to inflated costs and discourage efficiency. Citing figures like the $40 billion spent on military procurement in 1969, and referencing thinkers from Lord Kelvin and Oscar Wilde to Peter Drucker, he challenged the profession to move beyond self-interest and corporate loyalty, urging them to embrace a broader public responsibility akin to the Hippocratic oath.</p>

<p>OR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY</p>
<p>ACCOUNTING PRACTICES - DO THEY PROTECT THE PUBLIC?</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U.S. Navy<br>at the<br>Federal Government Accountants Association<br>19th Annual National Symposium<br>Carillon Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida<br>Thursday, June 18, 1970</p>
<p>I welcome the opportunity to address your Association.</p>
<p>I have same definite views related to the theme of your Symposium<br>&quot;Prologue to Progress: Let the public service be a proud and lively career,&quot;<br>especially as it applies to the federal accountant.</p>
<p>It is my view that the accountant, particularly the federal accountant,<br>must accept a greater responsibility for the public well-being.</p>
<p>I am a Naval Officer and an engineer, not an accountant. My interest<br>in accounting stems from my experience in managing technical programs for<br>the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense, and from personal<br>concern as an interested citizen. It also stems from the fact that the<br>funds I am given are limited and must be expended as economically as possible<br>or we will have fewer ships to protect our country. Added to this is my<br>knowledge, based on much experience, that without the active help of account</p>
<p>ants, I cannot do my job efficiently.</p>
<p>Copyright 1970, H. G. Rickover<br>No permission needed for newspaper or news periodical use.<br>Above copyright notice to be used if most of speech reprinted.</p>
<p>For over 20 years I have been responsible for designing, procuring,<br>constructing and maintaining the nuclear plants in our nuclear-powered<br>warships. I was also responsible for the design and construction of the<br>Shippingport Atomic Power Station, the first full-scale central station<br>nuclear power plant in the United States. Managing civilian and military<br>programs has afforded me a unique opportunity to assess the contributions<br>as well as the deficiencies of federal accounting, particularly as they<br>relate to government dealings with industry.</p>
<p>Professional societies in all disciplines must, I believe,be more active<br>in looking out for the public interest. A year ago I made this same point<br>in an address to the American Society for Metals. I questioned whether<br>industrial safety codes developed by private industry associations were<br>adequate to prevent injury to the public health and well-being. I asked,<br>&quot;Who protects the public?&quot; The same question applies here. Who protects<br>the public in accounting matters?</p>
<p>Today our nation faces many difficult problems. Our cities are crowded<br>and run-down. We are using up our natural resources at a prodigious rate.<br>We have polluted our water supply and the air we breathe. The ecological<br>balance is threatened.</p>
<p>The ever-increasing concentration of econamic power in giant corporations<br>threatens our competitive economic structure. In a number of basic items,<br>our industrial society is no longer competitive in world markets. Balance</p>
<p>of payments deficits are a recurrent worry. Many of our institutions have</p>
<p>grown so large, they are almost unmanageable. For example, the Department</p>
<p>of Defense today is larger than the entire federal government was in 1939,<br>and federal employment has tripled since then. Inflation and cost overruns<br>are plaguing military programs. The public has lost confidence in military<br>procurement. The words &quot;economy in Government&quot; have lost significance.</p>
<p>Can the federal government accountants solve all of these problems?<br>Obviously not. But the point I want to make is that you could make a<br>greater contribution than you have in the past.</p>
<p>I am encouraged that your agenda includes panel discussions on three<br>topics relating to current problems in defense procurement: uniform cost<br>accounting standards, implementation of the Truth-in-Negotiations Act,<br>and profits on defense contracts. The problems in each of these areas<br>relate directly to your professional accounting responsibilities as well<br>as your responsibilities to the public.</p>
<p>The role of the federal government has expanded over the years. Today<br>the government affects the economic climate in which almost every industry<br>operates. It regulates banking, communications, broadcasting, transportation,<br>and utilities. It subsidizes farming, shipping, airlines, large and small<br>business. It spends $60 billion a year through government contracts. It<br>collects over $200 billion a year in income taxes, social security taxes,<br>excise taxes, and so forth. It greatly influences education, health and<br>welfare, scientific research and development--every aspect of national life.</p>
<p>The growth of large industrial and financial corporations has paralleled</p>
<p>the growth of the federal government. Years ago, the typical business unit</p>
<p>was a small, local establishment with a single owner. But for the past</p>
<p>one hundred years, the history of industrial development in the United States<br>is largely the story of the growth of large corporations. The advantages</p>
<p>of the corporation as an instrumentality for the conduct of business in a<br>free enterprise system have resulted in its phenomenal growth in the</p>
<p>United States. The reality is that a new economic order is emerging,<br>characterized by large industrial organizations that maintain a partnership<br>between themselves and government.</p>
<p>It may be that in this rapidly spiraling scientific and technological<br>age this is the best way to marshal our resources, both for national<br>security and for optimum economic use of resources and manpower. If this<br>is so, a great responsibility rests on all of us to see that these giant<br>organizations do not become, in effect, a fourth branch of aowutigient—a<br>fourth branch, but without the accountability to the public that is the<br>distinguishing mark of a democracy.</p>
<p>For if the tendency of the federal bureaucracy to make accommodations<br>with industrial corporations is not properly controlled, we will, in effect,<br>have a fourth branch of government, where men exert power without political<br>responsibility. This constitutes a threat to our democratic society and<br>makes it imperative that the federal accountant do his job properly, since<br>it is his responsibility to make relevant facts visible and to show the<br>financial consequences of management actions. It is therefore essential<br>that accounting be accurate in a total sense--that it be meticulous in</p>
<p>portraying facts as they are, not as sameone wants them to be. Lord</p>
<p>Kelvin once said:<br>&quot;When you measure what you are speaking about, and express it in<br>numbers, you know samething about it; but when you cannot measure<br>it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of<br>a meager and unsatisfactory kind.&quot;<br>It is the accountant&#x27;s job to insure that the relevant facts are expressed</p>
<p>in the right nunbers.</p>
<p>As our nation has grown, this role of the accountant, both in government<br>and out, becomes more and more important to the public and to those responsible</p>
<p>for the management and supervision of our large industrial and governmental</p>
<p>institutions.</p>
<p>Government, the public, and industry Management look to the accountant</p>
<p>for objective reports. They want differences in accounting figures to</p>
<p>reflect real differences. They want timely and responsive reports containing</p>
<p>reliable information so that they may be able to judge efficiency. This<br>cannot be achieved unless there are definitive rules and standards for</p>
<p>reporting costs.</p>
<p>The difference between Operating with and without definitive accounting</p>
<p>rules is like the difference between a man who has fallen into the water<br>and a man who is bathing--both have to swim, but one does it frantically<br>from necessity and the other deliberately from choice.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of accountants , and particularly of federal<br>accountants, to establish Proper standards. In my Opinion the federal<br>accountants have not, as a group, met their public responsibility in this</p>
<p>regard. Consider first the current Situation in defense contracting. The</p>
<p>Department of Defense spent over $40 billion for military procurement in<br>1969. Of this amount, about $4 billion was spent in formally advertised,<br>competitive contracts and the remainder, $ 36 billion, in negotiated procurements--<br>procurements which are not truly competitive. Of the $36 billion in<br>negotiated procurement, $24 billion was spent under sole-source contracts;<br>$12 billion in contracts involving only limited competition among two or<br>sometimes three bidders.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances supplier costs are bound to be the primary<br>consideration in determining contract prices. The government is,however,<br>compelled to rely almost entirely on the contractor&#x27;s estimates and cost<br>records for data to determine the reasonableness of the prices he demands.</p>
<p>I find that it is virtually impossible, without spending months<br>reconstructing each supplier&#x27;s books, to discover what it really costs to<br>manufacture defense equipment or how much profit contractors actually<br>make in producing it. The problem is the extreme variability of accounting<br>practices--the lack of uniform standards. Costs on some contracts are not<br>considered as costs on other contracts. Contractors price contracts under<br>one accounting system, yet charge their costs under a different accounting<br>system. On most defense contracts there is no requirement that the<br>contractor keep meaningful cost records. In these circumstances, it becomes<br>virtually impossible to determine true costs.</p>
<p>I first raised the issue of cost accounting standards for defense<br>contracts before Congress in 1963. Each year thereafter I testified before</p>
<p>Congressional cammittees about the serious need for such standards. Finally,</p>
<p>in 1968, the House of Representatives passed a bill requiring the development<br>of uniform cost accounting standards for defense contracts. Even at that<br>late date the accounting profession gave little heed to the problem..</p>
<p>In the 1968 Senate hearings on the House Bill, the Department of Defense<br>claimed that adequate standards already existed. The General Accounting<br>Office hedged and attempted to side-step the issue. The American Institute<br>of Certified Public Accountants opposed the bill. Financial executives of<br>company after company in the defense industry went on record against the<br>bill.</p>
<p>In all the accounting profession, only Mr. J. S. Seidman of Seidman<br>and Seidman, Certified Public Accountants, testified to the serious need<br>for cost accounting standards. The federal government accountants were<br>conspicuous by their silence. As a result, the bill that emerged fron |<br>Congress in 1968 required only that the General Accounting Office study the<br>Matter.</p>
<p>After studying it, the GAO agreed that aniitioem cost accounting standards<br>are both feasible and necessary. Mr. Staats, the Comptroller General, in<br>testimony before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, stated that he<br>believed uniform cost accounting standards would result in a substantial<br>saving of public funds. My own estimate is about $2 billion a year.</p>
<p>Industry, of course, strongly opposes uniform cost accounting standards.<br>It is lobbying to weaken, frustrate, or if possible kill wniform cost<br>accounting legislation. To hear industry tell it, wniform cost accounting</p>
<p>standards would be a tragedy.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Oscar Wilde&#x27;s famous quip about the death of Little<br>Nell in Dickens&#x27; Old Curiosity Shop a man would have to have a heart of<br>stone to read their stories without laughing. Industry naturally does not<br>like uniform cost accounting standards. It would like to continue the<br>system whereby it can nationalize its losses and privatize its gains.</p>
<p>To date this lobbying has been effective, aided to a considerable<br>degree by the reluctance of federal accountants, particularly the General<br>Accounting Office, to take the initiative in establishing such standards.<br>Several years ago, the General Accounting Office testified to Congress that<br>someone other than they should conduct the study of uniform accounting<br>standards. Ultimately, Congress had to direct it to make the study.</p>
<p>Now the study is complete and the need for uniform cost accounting<br>standards well established. However, the GAO--legally the most authorita-<br>tive accounting group in government--has once more testified that same<br>group other than itself should be given the job of setting these standards.</p>
<p>That office took a similar position when the Joint Economic Cammittee<br>asked it to study defense profits. The Comptroller General said it was<br>not his job; sameone else should do it--someone outside government:--or<br>industry might not cooperate.</p>
<p>One excuse given by the GAO in backing away from sensitive issues has<br>been that it lacks the legislative authority to do the job. Yet its charter<br>is extremely broad. Here is an extract:</p>
<p>&quot;The Camptroller General shall investigate at the seat of Government</p>
<p>or elsewhere, all matters relating to the receipt, disbursement,<br>and application of public funds, and shall make to the President<br>when requested by him and to Congress at the beginning of each<br>regular session, a report in writing of the work of the General<br>Accounting Office, containing recommendations concerning the<br>legislation he may deem necessary to facilitate the prompt and<br>accurate rendition and settlement of accounts and concerning such<br>other matters relating to the receipt, disbursement, and applica-<br>tion of public funds as he may think advisable. In such regular<br>report, or in a special report at any time when Congress is in<br>session, he shall make recommendations looking to greater economy<br>or efficiency in public expenditures.&quot;<br>Moreover, the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 states:<br>&quot;The Comptroller General *** shall prescribe the principles,<br>standards, and related requirements for accounting to be<br>observed by each executive agency ***&quot;<br>With such charters, the General Accounting Office has adequate authority<br>to get into virtually all aspects of government operations, The office<br>could, in a sense, became the conscience of our government; it could<br>also become a center of excellence, a locus of discontent. However, it has<br>waited for others to take the lead in these fundamental issues.<br>This characteristic is not peculiar to the General Accounting Office<br>alone. I see it in the conduct of other groups of federal accountants as</p>
<p>well. So in considering the matter of uniform cost accounting standards,</p>
<p>- ——————————aooaoqaqooooouooEaoEoEOoeooeeeeeeee eee</p>
<p>the question keeps occuring to me: Where have the federal accountants</p>
<p>been all these years? Why haven&#x27;t they raised the issue long ago? Whose<br>job is it to see that adequate accounting standards exist to protect<br>public funds? Is it among the duties of a naval officer? Is it the ja<br>of Congress?</p>
<p>Take another area--renegotiation of government contracts.</p>
<p>Renegotiation as it is presently carried out cannot be effective.<br>Because of exemptions in the law, large blocks of defense work are not<br>even covered by renegotiation. Moreover, the Renegotiation Board uses<br>Internal Revenue Service accounting rules for cost and profit determinations.<br>Any accountant knows that Internal Revenue Service rules were not designed<br>for cost accounting and that they are inadequate for the purpose. The<br>apparent standard is no standard at all. Industry can report, for<br>renegotiation purposes, almost whatever profit it chooses.</p>
<p>Time and again I find that cost and profit figures reported by<br>contractors differ substantially fram the figures found subsequently by<br>government audit. Yet the Board accepts these industry reports at face<br>value, without even auditing them. Its staff has been kept so small that<br>the Board, even had it wanted to, could not have closely checked contractor<br>reports.</p>
<p>Thus, we have the semblance but not the substance of effective<br>renegotiation. Uniform cost accounting standards are fundamental to making<br>renegotiation an effective process. The public does not understand this.</p>
<p>Nor are most members of Congress fully aware of this need.</p>
<p>- 10 -</p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if the Internal Revenue Service started<br>accepting tax returns at face value. The tax collection system would not<br>be effective or equitable. Yet the Renegotiation Board has been accepting<br>renegotiation statements at face value for years.</p>
<p>There are other loopholes in the renegotiation process. For example,<br>the Renegotiation Act permits a contractor to average profits over all<br>his business. The growth of conglomerates in recent years has made this a<br>significant loophole. In 1951, when the Renegotiation Act was passed,<br>most of the Navy&#x27;s major private shipbuilders were independent companies<br>devoted chiefly to shipbuilding, and with their own corporate managenents.<br>They had to file profit statements on their shipbuilding activities with<br>the Renegotiation Board. But today, most of these shipbuilders have<br>become divisions or subsidiaries of giant conglomerates. Electric Boat<br>Company is now a division of General Dynamics Corporation; Ingalls Ship-<br>building Company a division of Litton Industries; Puget Sound Bridge &amp;</p>
<p>Dry Dock Company a division of Lockheed Aircraft Company; Avondale Shipyard<br>a divisien of Ogden Corporation; and the Navy&#x27;s largest private shipbuilder,<br>Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Campany, has now been taken over by<br>Tenneco.</p>
<p>Consequently the Renegotiation Board no longer gets a direct look at<br>the profits earned by the Navy&#x27;s shipbuilders. The Board may review the<br>defense profit of the conglomerate, but that figure merely reflects the<br>total profit on all its defense contracts. The government has effectively</p>
<p>lost its ability to check against excessive profits on shipbuilding contracts.</p>
<p>-ll-</p>
<p>The rules established for renegotiation in 1951 are simply not</p>
<p>adequate today. We must have accurate financial reports to make the<br>system work. I should think federal accountants would be deeply<br>concerned with this problem since it so deeply affects the public interest.</p>
<p>Other areas of government activity besides renegotiation have been<br>adversely affected by the trend toward large conglomerates.</p>
<p>These continuing mergers of large corporations present a number of<br>problems in connection with their defense work. Besides having to pay<br>the normal operating costs of the division actually performing government<br>work, the government now has additionally to pay a tax in the form of<br>a corporate general and administrative expense rate levied by the parent<br>company on its division--hence on the government. Therefore, the cost of<br>government work goes Up. It is not clear to me what value the government<br>gets for the additional cost. I am involved in one case where the major<br>portion of the general and administrative tax levied on government work<br>consists of interest expense on the debt incurred by the conglamerate in<br>acquiring the company.</p>
<p>These mergers tend to result in what might be called &quot;pooling of<br>inefficiencies&quot;. My experience is that conglomerate managements generally<br>do not much concern themselves with improving efficiency of the companies<br>they acquire. Rather, they concentrate most of their efforts in seeking<br>ways to eke out more cash or profits fram the business. Much effort goes<br>into looking at ways to reduce the company&#x27;s investment in facilities and</p>
<p>inventories, even if this results in higher operating costs. Since most</p>
<p>- 12-</p>
<p>defense procurement is non-competitive, defense contractors are usually<br>able to pass these higher operating costs directly onto the government.<br>Under Department of Defense rules for determining profit as percentage<br>of costs, the higher the operating costs, the higher the profits.<br>Another problem concerns depreciation costs. Suppose Company A has<br>a plant making defense equipment. Company A is then merged into a cong-<br>lomerate. The government, in the price of its contracts, has absorbed much<br>of Company A&#x27;s depreciation expense. However, under current accounting<br>rules for acquisitions by purchase, the conglomerate may revalue Campany<br>A&#x27;s fixed assets to a new higher value--a so-called &quot;fair market value&quot;—-<br>as part of the merger. Campany A is then able to write off on government<br>contracts more than it paid originally for the plant. It can charge the<br>government higher depreciation costs for the very same plant, even though<br>the only &quot;improvement&quot; is a new name over the door.<br>Conglomerate mergers have been thriving for over 20 years, aided by<br>loose accounting rules and practices. The question is whether these loose<br>rules and practices are in the public interest. Today two companies may<br>merge without any recognition of a gain or loss in the transaction--even<br>if there is a large gain for one of the companies. I understand that<br>the Accounting Principles Board will be meeting in the near future to<br>consider new standards to restrict certain aspects of accounting for mergers,<br>but the situation has been allowed to go on far too long.<br>There are other illustrations indicating that you, as federal government<br>accountants, have been dilatory in facing up to problems affecting the</p>
<p>public interest.</p>
<p>-13-</p>
<p>Recently, I read that banks, unlike other industries, have not been</p>
<p>required to show losses on loans--or gains and losses on security trans-<br>actions--in their net income figures. So for years banks have reported<br>income figures higher or lower than their actual income.<br>The Federal Trade Comission, to put it mildly, has been slow in facing |<br>up to the issue of whether companies should be required to report costs<br>and profits by product lines. ‘The Securities and Exchange Conmission—- |<br>although it has extensive statutory authority over security issuers!<br>accounting methods--has been less than avid in requiring conglomerates to.<br>report profit and other financial information regarding the operations of<br>major divisions or subsidiaries. The Interstate Commerce Commission has<br>also managed to avoid getting involved in these disagreeable matters. In<br>1960, it ruled that public statements had to conform to a uniform system<br>of accounts. But two years later, the Commission rescinded this rule and<br>authorized carriers to issue public statements based on &quot;generally accepted<br>accounting principles,&quot;<br>In all these cases federal agencies and federal accountants could have<br>been more effective in making certain that the public gets relevant and<br>adequate financial information.<br>The Truth-in-Negotiations Act is another case where federal government |<br>accountants have not been adequately protecting the public. You have<br>scheduled a panel discussion on the subject. I hope you will consider<br>two major points: First, what positive action will your organization take</p>
<p>to pramote full compliance with the spirit and the letter of the Act?</p>
<p>- 14 - 1</p>
<p>The Act was Passed in 1962. It has not yet been fully implemented,</p>
<p>For example, I found recently that our major Shipbuilders had not yet<br>carried out its provisions. Steel companies, the forging industry, the<br>computer industry, and other material Suppliers all refuse to provide<br>the cost and pricing data required by the Act. These are merely the<br>industries where I have had first hand experience, [ understand there<br>are others that ignore the Truth-in-Negotiations Act,</p>
<p>Since your own membership would not raise these issues, I decided to</p>
<p>do so myself. [ investigated and Yeported that our Shipyards were not</p>
<p>I have given cane aS no surprise to you.</p>
<p>Defense procurement officials, however, Profess ignorance. They have</p>
<p>- 15 -</p>
<p>Congress has been led to believe that the Truth-in-Negotiations Act<br>has been an effective safeguard against overcharging. In truth,</p>
<p>however, in the case of a large number of favored companies and industries .<br>it is not being applied at all,</p>
<p>I believe that federal accountants should be playing a major role in<br>settling the long standing controversy over profits on defense contracts.<br>The issue is simple: the Defense Department pays out billions of dollars<br>each year in profits to defense contractors. My experience has been that<br>in many cases defense profits are too high; that in the public interest<br>we should know exactly how much profit each contractor makes on his defense<br>work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Department of Defense and industry contend that<br>defense profits are low. Yet they will not set up a profit reporting system<br>that would reveal factual data on defense profits.</p>
<p>Instead they have tried to assuage public concern with estimates of<br>defense profits based on questionnaires, surveys, stockholder reports,<br>volunteered information, Renegotiation Board data, and the like. Studies<br>by the Logistics Management Institute--studies financed by the Department<br>of Defense--have been the most publicized of these estimates.</p>
<p>These estimates are then used to support the Defense Department and<br>industry position that on the average, defense profits are low. Any<br>accountant however recognizes the hazards of averages. I am reminded of<br>the six-foot tall traveler who had been told that the river he was about to</p>
<p>cross had an average depth of three feet. He drowned, a victim of averages.</p>
<p>-16-</p>
<p>The public, members of Congress, and government officials receiving<br>these profit studies tend to accept the information at face value, not<br>understanding how easy it is to conceal serious problems in averages and<br>that, in the absence of definitive accounting standards, contractors can<br>report whatever profit figures will suit their purpose. The fact is that no<br>one in government knows how much profit is actually being made on defense<br>contracts.</p>
<p>In case after case you will find companies changing their accounting<br>system, or changing asset valuation, or changing their method of depreciation<br>to show a different overall profit figure. They have great flexibility in<br>deciding how to assign costs and profits between defense and non-defense<br>work. No one ever checks the details. Such checks would be of limited<br>value anyway because of the absence of definitive accounting standards.</p>
<p>Just a week ago, a large conglomerate--one of the nation&#x27;s largest<br>defense contractors--announced that the company was considering changes to<br>its 1969 financial statements. The campany stated:</p>
<p>&quot;These [changes] include some accounting entries involving a change</p>
<p>to an expense basis of accounting in one division, which became a</p>
<p>charge to income of $10 million, and another change in the reserve</p>
<p>for depreciation of another division, which became a credit of $13</p>
<p>million, and other miscellaneous items.&quot;</p>
<p>This shows the flexibility they have in accounting matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Peter Drucker, the management expert, stated the issue succinctly<br>when he said: &quot;Far too few management scientists...realize that practically</p>
<p>every single definition of accounting is based on assumptions of high</p>
<p>-17-</p>
<p>metaphysical content--and that any accountant worth his salt can convert<br>any profit figure into a loss figure, or vice versa, if given control of<br>the accounting definitions, all unquestionably within the limits of the<br>Proper accounting practice,&quot;</p>
<p>All of you no doubt recognize the problem. But is it not your<br>professional responsibility to make government and the public aware of it?</p>
<p>There is another aspect to the question of profits on defense contracts.<br>Industry&#x27;s accepted criterion for profitability is return on investment.<br>But the defense procurement regulation is based on computing profit as a<br>percentage of cost. |</p>
<p>The effect of this regulation is to discourage efficiency. Since<br>Campetition in the defense industry is limited, contractors who increase<br>their efficiency may, in the long run, actually lose profit under the<br>Present system. If it costs $100 to do a job and the prevailing profit<br>Paid under Department of Defense guidelines is 10 percent, the contractor<br>will get $10 profit every time he does that job. If he cuts his costs to<br>$90, he will get only $9 profit in the future. Thus, contractors get higher<br>profits in the long run by keeping costs up. So they have little incentive<br>to invest in facilities and in new machine tools which could make defense<br>work more efficient and less costly. There is instead a strong incentive<br>to maintain minimum investment with the highest possible cost base for<br>determining profit.</p>
<p>This is a problem apparent to federal government accountants. I</p>
<p>believe you have a duty to make it known to the government and the public.</p>
<p>- 18 -</p>
<p>In case after case I observe federal accountants letting others take</p>
<p>the lead in the very area where you should have been pioneers protecting</p>
<p>the public. Take the issue of uniform cost accounting standards which is<br>neither new nor revolutionary. This concept has existed in Continental Europe<br>for years.</p>
<p>In the early 1920&#x27;s the German professor Eugene Schmalenbach was<br>frustrated by his inability to make accurate comparisons of the financial<br>data made available by different companies. His Model Chart of Accounts<br>laid the foundation for the subsequent development of uniform accounting<br>in Germany and in other European countries.</p>
<p>Today, uniform plans of accounts are used in Germany for more than 100<br>applications. These plans range from simple classifications for individual<br>proprietorships and tradesmen to complex uniform plans of accounting for<br>large industrial enterprises. In France, the official General Accounting Plan<br>has been mandatory since 1947 for publicly owned enterprises and for firms<br>receiving government subsidies. other European countries have similar plans.<br>Yet in our country the notion of uniform accounting standards has been viewed<br>by accountants, including federal accountants, as an heretical idea.</p>
<p>Accountants in this country have been slow to face up to other aspects<br>of their public responsibility as well. Until 40 years ago they recognized<br>no legal or professional responsibility to anyone other than the inmediate<br>client. The 1931 court decision in the case of Ultramares Corp. v. Touche,<br>Niven &amp; Co. upheld this point of view. A creditor, relying on an accountant&#x27;s</p>
<p>certification of the corporation&#x27;s financial statements, lent money to a</p>
<p>- 19 -</p>
<p>small corporation. The corporation went bankrupt within a few months.</p>
<p>The creditor then sued the accountant, arguing that he had relied on the<br>accountant&#x27;s certification. Judge Cardozo ruled that the accountant was<br>not liable to the creditor. He said that, except in cases of actual fraud,<br>an accountant had no legal duty except to the person who hired him or to</p>
<p>a third party, if the accountant knew at the time of the certification<br>that the third party would rely on the certification. Of this decision<br>Iord Justice Denning said: &quot;I think it is to be regretted, for it means<br>that the accountant&#x27;s certification, which could be a safeguard, becomes ,<br>a snare for those who rely on it.&quot;</p>
<p>While the courts held to this precedent for 25 years, the 1933 law<br>establishing the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the government<br>broad powers over security issues, accounting methods, and public dis-<br>closure of financial information.</p>
<p>The accounting profession, too, began to consider its professional<br>responsibility. In 1938 the American Institute of Accountants established<br>a Committee on Accounting Procedure, forerunner of the present Accounting<br>Principles Board. The Committee was, however, largely ineffectual. In<br>the 21 years of its existence it published 51 research bulletins recommending<br>acceptable procedures. According to one analysis:</p>
<p>&quot;The Bulletins tended to present ad hoc solutions to unrelated</p>
<p>specific problems and frequently recognized the acceptability of</p>
<p>two or more procedures for accounting for identical transactions</p>
<p>occurring under identical circumstances. Furthermore, the Bulletins .</p>
<p>presented recommendations only; with the exception of the six rules</p>
<p>.7 20-</p>
<p>.<br>wee ee</p>
<p>adopted by the AICPA membership vote, the conclusions contained in the</p>
<p>Bulletins were not binding on the Institute membership. Accordingly,</p>
<p>procedures not embraced in the Bulletins might also be considered to</p>
<p>be ‘generally accepted&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the idea of increasing the scope of responsibility of public<br>accountants was growing in legal and financial circles. A. series of<br>judicial decisions in the 1960&#x27;s in effect overturned the Ultramares<br>decision. Thus, in the Yale Express case, an accounting fim, Peat, Marwick,<br>and Mitchell, discovered that figures previously certified in annual reports<br>‘ were false and misleading. But they waited more than a year before they informed<br>the Securities and Exchange Commission and the investing public of the<br>falsity of the certified report, In a suit against the accounting<br>firm by a group of investors and creditors, a federal court ruled that the<br>firm could be held liable to investors and lenders even though it had no<br>contractual relationship with these investors and had received no financial<br>benefit from the nondisclosure.</p>
<p>In Rusch Factors Inc., v. Levin, the court held that an accountant<br>was liable for his &quot;professional malpractice&quot; to any third party who might<br>foreseeably rely on the accountant&#x27;s certification.</p>
<p>In recent years more than 100 similiar suits have been filed, all based<br>on the concept of the public accountant&#x27;s public responsibility. These cases<br>involve some of the largest and most prestigious fixms in the profession.<br>Ernst &amp; Ernst faces a number of suits concerning allegedly misleading<br>financial statements about the Westec Corporation; and two partners of</p>
<p>Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery were held liable for inaccuracies in</p>
<p>-21-</p>
<p>the prospectus of BarChris Construction Canpany.<br>Mr. Leonard Spacek, chairman of Arthur Andersen and Company,is one of</p>
<p>the few public accountants who have recognized this issue of public</p>
<p>responsibility. He said:</p>
<p>&quot;The accounting profession hasn&#x27;t recognized the fact that public</p>
<p>ownership exists. The profession still labors under the impression</p>
<p>that it is working for entrepreneurs who know all the details about their</p>
<p>campanies—-the accountants have thought little about what the public</p>
<p>investor wants to know.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly the courts now recognize--even though most members of the<br>accounting profession may not~~that accountants have a broad general res-</p>
<p>ponsibility, not only to their clients but to the public as well. But</p>
<p>too often, loyalty to an employer takes precedence over the public interest.</p>
<p>The essential service of the accounting profession is to sort out and<br>direct attention to relevant facts regarding performance. The nature of<br>federal government accounting work carries you to the very heart of all<br>aspects of our government&#x27;s operations. You are in a unique position to<br>seek out fundamental deficiencies in the conduct of public business and<br>to pramote reform. This, moreover, is your primary responsibility, both<br>as individuals and as a professional association. .</p>
<p>The idea of individual responsibility is paramount. Time and again<br>in my work I have seen improper and wasteful practices by contractors go<br>uncorrected because the responsible government officials did not see to it</p>
<p>that government work was performed properly. These officials limit their</p>
<p>- 22 -</p>
<p>activities to the narrow confines of their jcb descriptions, ignoring<br>many basic deficiencies not literally spelled out as matters for which<br>they are responsible. After awhile deficient practices became accepted as<br>away Of life. As Alexander Pope said:<br>&quot;Familiar with her face,<br>We first endure,<br>Then pity, then embrace.&quot;<br>Inevitably when I look into these deficiencies I find that it is not<br>a question of an insufficiency of government personnel, or inadequacy of<br>government salaries. Rather, I find the deficiencies are prevalent because<br>government officials will not accept the responsibility to look after the<br>government&#x27;s interests in the broad sense of the term. They become instead<br>a sort of bystander, an cbserver duly recording what the contractor chooses<br>to show him. Whether he is an accountant, lawyer, engineer, or military<br>professionat, the principal duty of a government official is to protect the<br>government-——and thus the American public--financially, legally, and<br>technically.<br>Responsibility is a unique concept. It can only reside and inhere in<br>a single individual. You may share it with others, but your portion is not<br>diminished. You may delegate it, but it is still with you. You may disclaim<br>it, but you cannot divest yourself of it. Even if you do not recognize it<br>or admit its presence you cannot escape it. If responsibility is rightfully<br>yours, no evasion, or ignorance, or passing the blame can shift the burden<br>to sameone else.<br>I have been criticized because I, a Naval Officer, have intruded into.</p>
<p>accounting matters. My answer is that as long as accountants neglect their</p>
<p>-23-</p>
<p>own responsibilities, to the detriment of mine, I will continue to intrude.<br>It is my responsibility to do so. When an institution does not do its<br>job, a vacuum is created and some outsider always has to step in and fill<br>the vacuum.</p>
<p>If you as federal accountants desire to be considered professionals,<br>you must earn the title by your attitude and by your actions. One does<br>not become a professional simply by getting a degree. Professionalism<br>requires one to maintain constant awareness and consciousness of all matters<br>affecting his area of compentence; it also requires continued application of<br>one&#x27;s capabilities to advance his chosen field.</p>
<p>Nor does a society of accountants become a professional group merely<br>by holding meetings and symposia. It is the application of the total<br>effort of the group to correction of specific problems and to advancement<br>of the field as a whole in the public interest; it is acceptance of the<br>duties such a responsibility entails that is the distinguishing characteristic<br>of a true professional society.</p>
<p>Contractors, industry associations, Washington lawyers--all exert<br>tremendous pressure on legislators and government officials to loosen the<br>constraints of laws, regulations, and policies governing their conduct.<br>Federal government accountants mist became the counterpoise.</p>
<p>By failing to work for rules and standards of accounting protecting the<br>public, your profession has in my opinion neglected its public responsibilities.<br>For, in the absence of such standards, industry has been free to use</p>
<p>accounting flexibility to its own advantage and to the disadvantage of the</p>
<p>- 24 -</p>
<p>public. Moreover, because the profession has been laggard in promoting</p>
<p>authoritative standards , accounting issues are being decided by boards, by<br>courts, and by jndustry--instead of by accountants.</p>
<p>I want to make jt clear that in speaking sO frankly, I do so with no<br>derogatory intent. I am reminded of the old Indian prayer: &quot;Great Spirit,<br>grant that T may not criticize my neighbor until I have walked a mile in<br>his moccasins.&quot; My comments reflect my experience of nearly half a century<br>in government service. If 1 speak critically, I do so because I believe<br>that a camplex industrial society such as ours cannot be conducted efficiently<br>and for the public good unless there is a group such as yours that is<br>qualified for and faithfully carries out its duties. Only by informed<br>criticism can our society be improved; only so improved can it survive.</p>
<p>I believe that as federal accountants you have a responsibility to take<br>the lead in accounting matters affecting the federal government. You cannot<br>simply leave it to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants;<br>their actions have shown them to be incapable of resolving these issues.</p>
<p>Moreover, I do not think you can expect the public accountants hired by<br>industry to establish proper cost accounting standards for defense contracts.<br>Despite their best effort at objectivity and professionalism, they must<br>represent industry, since they are paid by industry. Unless they represent<br>industry, their services will not be retained. &quot;Whose bread I eat, his song<br>I sing.&quot; I am not sure just how much you can count on a firm&#x27;s objectivity<br>when its financial benefit depends on its business with a campany that has a</p>
<p>vested interest in the accountant&#x27;s report.</p>
<p>In contrast, the clear duty of the federal accountant is to the<br>public. If the Federal Government Accountants Association is to be more than<br>a social club, it must assume a greater role in locking after the public<br>interest in all accounting and auditing matters affecting public funds or<br>public well-being.</p>
<p>I suggest that your Association give consideration to adopting a creed<br>similar to the one formulated by Hippocrates for the medical profession same<br>24 centuries ago. That oath has stood the test of time. As I see it,<br>your responsibility as members of a profession rather than a business is<br>to bring out the truth in an area where the Government, and hence the<br>American public, must deal with manipulation of facts. You have the<br>expertise which the public lacks to cut through these manipulations</p>
<p>to the truth and to make it known.</p>
