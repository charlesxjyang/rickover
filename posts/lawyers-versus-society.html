      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his pointed March 30, 1979 speech, &quot;Lawyers Versus Society,&quot; Admiral H. G. Rickover delivers a scathing critique of the legal profession, asserting that its pursuit of money and power undermines justice, erodes public trust, and negatively impacts national defense. He argues that many lawyers prioritize their own interests, engaging in &quot;frivolous litigation, legal maneuvering, massive discovery campaigns, and delaying tactics&quot; that obfuscate issues rather than resolve disputes. Rickover substantiates his claims with striking examples, including a $500,000 overcharge case that took 15 years to reach trial, a $1 billion claim against the Navy comprising 64 volumes that diverted key personnel for years, and his own 40-hour deposition experience, all highlighting the cost and inefficiency of the system. He also criticizes patent lawyers for hindering competition and the American Bar Association (ABA) for acting as a &quot;protective association&quot; that fails to discipline members, citing instances of light punishments for serious misconduct and the &quot;revolving door&quot; phenomenon where former government lawyers litigate against their previous agencies. Rickover concludes by urging the legal community to address these issues by strengthening deterrents against false pleadings, establishing a forum that prioritizes professional responsibility over commercial gain, and actively policing their own, likening the task to cleansing the &quot;Augean Stables.&quot;</p>

        <p>I do not have the slightest interest in providing entertain- ment for dinner parties or for anyone else, I have always lived, among other rules, by the one “heaven is blest with perfect rest, but the blessing of earth is honest toil.” my sole reason for coming here is to impress upon you the need and importance for the legal profession to start playing a truly responsible role in our society,</p>
<p>There has been a breach of faith by lawyers--and the public knows it, a recent national poll found them ranked below garbage collectors in public esteem and that but a small part of the public has confidence in law firms, the chief justice of the supreme court recently concluded that a majority of lawyers practicing in court are not properly equipped to do so, the president himself has stated publicly that we are “over-lawyered and under-represented.” a foreign official has commented: “you have lawyers like other people have mice.”</p>
<p>It is argued that our adversary system of law demands that attorneys litigate vigorously, regardless of the merits of their client's case. This view has become a rationalization for practicing the law in a way that frequently offends justice and debases the integrity of our judicial system, too often the finances, patience, and time available to a litigant have become more important to the outcome of a case than its legal merits. Lawyers should instead strive to focus the court's attention on the legal or factual issues in dispute quickly and efficiently. But many of them do the opposite,</p>
<p>As one minor example, fifteen years ago, the general accounting office reported that a large defense contractor had overcharged the government $500,000 on one of my contracts. Last december the issue finally came to trial. I expect a</p>
<p>How is the common good served when lawyers obfuscate issues, delay and harass the opposition, and attempt to abrogate contracts? How is justice served by frustrating the legal institutions and procedures that have been established and are available to the public for resolution of disputes? Even when both parties can afford the legal costs, the delay and harassment now typically involved in litigation make it increasingly unattractive to all except the lawyers. Moreover, through delay, one party can effectively deny his adversary’s right to a judicial determination,</p>
<p>Taling more than $500 million under a special law congress had enacted to cover extraordinary actions determined 10 be necessary to facilitate the national defense. The secretary said that not granting such relief would inevitably mean long years of litigation and a disruptive relationship which would unreasonably jeopardize the national defense.</p>
<p>Some draw an analogy with other types of litigation, such as personal injury suits where a lawyer might ask for $1 million in damages in the hope of recovering $25,000, in such cases, no one takes the initial amount seriously. The judge or jury arrives at a figure independently, based on the testimony of witnesses,</p>
<p>Wide ranging interrogatories and extensive discovery requests have become a standard legal tactic. I understand some law firms have thousands of questions stored in computers, available at the press of a button, thus, even the limits of an attorney's imagination or time need no longer be a constraint on the mischief he can cause,</p>
<p>Information. Yet under another statute, they can be fined and imprisoned for releasing a company's proprietary data, one company sues the government to disclose data about a competitor; the competitor then sues to forbid its release, this is an example of the chaos produced by the fertile minds of our lawyers, it is also an example of the advantage lawyers are taking of the system to promote the interests of their clients--and themselves, I doubt that those who enacted the freedom of information act envisioned the uses to which it has been put by lawyers,</p>
<p>The patent lawyers here tonight may have been wondering why so far I have not alluded to them, yet patent lawyers exhibit the same tendencies that pervade other segments of the profession, they too are skilled in the tactics of obfuscation and delay, moreover, I believe that many patent lawyers do harm to the economy and to the credibility of the patent system, frequently they represent the narrow economic interests of their clients, to the detriment of the public, by using such tactics as indiscriminate patenting of minor design details,</p>
<p>The patent lobby is actively promoting the concept that the government should provide businessmen greater incentives to invest in technology in order to combat a perceived decline in this country’s technological growth. The recommended incentives take the form of increased government spending for research and development and granting contractors exclusive rights to patents developed at government expense,</p>
<p>1 AM not convinced that there is actually a decline in technology or that the infusion of government funds would be an appropriate solution, in any event, should the government spend more, large companies will probably get the lion's share of the increase--as they always do,</p>
<p>Aat would an ordinary taxpayer think if that company could, for 17 years, legally control the dissemination, use, and pricing of this invention? Yet this is what the patent lobby advocates, :</p>
<p>Most professions have a group that sets standards of conduct for its members, and is supposed to discipline transgressors--an organization whose charter places professionalism above money considerations. In the legal community, this group is the american bar association,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this organization seems to be further undermining respect for the legal profession, by responding with a counter attack to thoughtful criticism by our president and our chief justice, the aba showed it is more interested in preserving its customs, than in being a professional organization, perhaps it should be renamed the american bar protective association, or abpa,</p>
<p>The aba’s disciplinary procedures are widely recognized as a token effort, with disbarment reserved primarily for the rare member who is occasionally convicted of a felony, even where misconduct is found, punishments are often light, a pennsylvania attorney, found guilty of embezzling $10,000 from a client's inheritance, was merely suspended from the aba, a new york attorney refused to allow his client to be brought to trial until his fee had been paid, he then deducted the fee from the bail money, which he intercepted, the aba called the incident a mere fee dispute and took no disciplinary action,</p>
<p>The aba has done nothing to solve the revolving door problem--where lawyers get experience in government, and then join private firms which represent clients against their former government agency, one washington law firm that specializes in claims against the navy is headed by a former navy general counsel. Another such firm was headed by a former member of the defense department’s armed services board of contract appeals, and only last month the chairman of this very save board resigned to become a partner in this very save firm. There he will join an ex-navy deputy counsel who was responsible for defending the government against shipbuilding claims.</p>
<p>Later I learned that the aba lobbyists who worked on this bill were senior partners of prominent, claims oriented law firms. Claims lawyers, like other citizens, are entitled to lobby members of congress in their own behalf, but for them to do so by using the american bar association as the umbrella degrades the entire profession. Why does the aba tolerate such actions taken in its name?</p>
<p>Lawyers occupy key positions and exert great influence | in our society, many other citizens, also seeking success, ! Emulate them, is the example being set by many in the legal profession of benefit to our society, or is it harmful?</p>
<p>What happens to traditional values when signed contracts are broken with no moral stigma attached to those who break them; when people are driven, under threat of litigation, to pay sums they may not owe; when those skilled in thwarting justice are considered successful men?</p>
<p>That basis?</p>
<p>The freedom and privilege you presently enjoy will not last, nor will it be available to future generations, unless you do so; unless you act as responsible professionals and citizens; unless you treat those who act irresponsibly as they deserve to be treated,</p>
<p>In coming here I feel a bit like eurystheus of greek mythology, the augean stables housed three thousand oxen and had not been cleaned for thirty years, eurystheus did not have the wherewithal to clean the stables himself, but he did point out the problem to hercules, who cleaned them by diverting two rivers,</p>
<p>In similar vein, I can only hope that some of you will take on the herculean task of cleansing the legal profession, this is well worth the effort, even if you have to drown a few oxen in the process,</p>
