      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This May 18, 1962, hearing features Admiral H.G. Rickover advocating for continued development of the &quot;seed-blanket&quot; reactor concept, emphasizing **conservation of natural resources** over immediate economic competitiveness. He highlights the success of the Shippingport reactor, which derived 53% of its total core energy from a natural uranium blanket that lasted over 27,000 full power hours, significantly reducing reprocessing needs and waste. Rickover proposes a 5-6 year design and development program for a larger 500,000-kilowatt plant, aiming to advance reactor technology applicable to all civilian power reactors, similar to Shippingport&#x27;s pioneering contributions in uranium oxide fuel and reactor components. Initial cost estimates are $95 million for research and development and $100 million for construction. Rickover clarifies that current reactors are &quot;converters&quot; rather than &quot;breeders,&quot; and he maintains a realistic, long-term perspective on atomic power&#x27;s economic viability, stating his primary motivation is prudent use of irreplaceable natural resources, not immediate profitability. The session details his commitment to transparency and the initial $7.5 million appropriation request for this study phase.</p>

<p>Coneress or THE UNrrep Srarss, SUBCOMMITTEE ON LrGISLATION, Joint Commirrer on Arvosric Enrrey, . Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The subcommittee met, pursuant to recess, at 2 p.m. in room AE-1, the Capitol, Hon. John O. Pastore (chairman of the subcommittee)</p>
<p>residing;</p>
<p>P Present: Senators Pastore, Anderson, Aiken, and Dworshak, Rep- resentatives Holifield and Hosmer.</p>
<p>Also present: Janes T. Ramey, executive director; David R. Toll, committee counsel; Edward J. Bauser, technical adviser; Kenneth McAlpine and Jack R. Newman, professional staff members; and Raymond J. Poskaitis, General Accounting Office consultant.</p>
<p>Witnesses</p>
<p>Vice Adm. H. G. Rickover, Manager, Naval Reactors, Division of Reactor Development; and I. H. Mandel, Chief, Reactor Engineer- ing Branch, Naval Reactors, Division of Reactor Development, Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. The Subcommittee on Legislation of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is continuing public hearings on H.R. 11733 and S. 3292, bills to authorize appropriations for the Atomic Energy Commission for fiscal year 1963. :</p>
<p>Today our first. witness will be Adm. H. G. Rickover, Chief of the Naval Reactors Branch of the AEC. On Wednesday AEC Chair- man Seaborg testified that the Commission’s uppropriations request for fiscal year 1968 includes $7,500,000 for research and development work to be performed in fiscal years 1963 and 1964, together with appropriate engineering and design effort, sufficient to determine the potential of a 500-electrical megawatt central station seed-blanket plant and to make a decision on construction of such a plant. We have asked Admiral Rickover to furnish the subcommittee additional information concerning the seed-blanket concept, and to make such other comments as he may desire concerning the atomic power program.</p>
<p>After completion of Admiral Rickover’s testimony, the subcom- mittee wit resume consideration of the bill, commencing with proj- ect 63-k-1,</p>
<p>_ We are very pleased to have you with us this afternoon, Admiral Rickover. Please proceed.</p>
<p>292 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Srrep-blanket concept</p>
<p>Admiral .Rickover. I do appreciate very much being here, sir, and having the opportunity: to tal atomic powerplant design based on the seed-blanket concept.</p>
<p>May I have your permission, sir, to tell you why we chose the partic- ular design of the Shippingport reactor which utilizes the seed- blanket concept and which is a different one than other reactor design- ers have chosen. I believe it would be of interest to your committee to get a brief résumé of the reasons leading to this approach. _ '</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. You may proceed in any way you wish, Admiral.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It seemed to me in 1954, at the time we started considering civilian atomic power that it would be purposeless to proceed on such a venture unless it would result in a conservation of our natural resources; that is we should design a reasonable size plant that would produce as much energy as possible from natural uranium. Because whenever you are forced to use enriched uranium, whether it be 2 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent or 93 percent, enriched, you are actually using substantial amounts of coal indirectly since it takes considerable quantities of electrical power to make the enriched uranium.</p>
<p>Obviously if atomic power is to replace coal, there is little point in —</p>
<p>using coal to make enriched uranium and then using this uranium to generate atomic power ; this would be self-defeating. So it was from the standpoint of conserving our natural resources</p>
<p>that we chose to develop the seed-blanket concept. This system uses — a minimum of enriched U 235—for example, in the Shippingport ~</p>
<p>reactor there are about 90 kilograms of U 235—and a blanket of 14 tons of natural uranium. The idea is to keep the natura] uranium</p>
<p>in place as long as possible and to get all of the energy you can out 3</p>
<p>of it. This energy comes from the seventh-tenths of 1 percent ©:</p>
<p>U 235 which is inherent in the natural uranium; from the fast fission- — ing of U 238; and from the plutonium which is formed in the natural —</p>
<p>uranium in the reactor.</p>
<p>What we hoped for has happened. We expect, at the end of the ;</p>
<p>lifetime of the present natural uranium blanket in the Shippingport reactor, to have obtained about 53 percent of the total energy pro-</p>
<p>duced by the core from the natural uranium. The significance of this — is that you take natural uranium, you keep it in place in the reactor — possible with — the result that there is little need to chemically reprocess it when you —</p>
<p>for several years, you burn it up to the maximum extent remove it from the reactor.</p>
<p>Possible advantages of seed-blanket core</p>
<p>When the entire core utilizes slightly enriched uranium as a num- — ber of reactors do, this slightly enriched fuel must. be chemically re- — pie formed. That introduces two”</p>
<p>chemical reprocessing itself with the at-— tendant radioactive wastes which are inherent and whose disposition” or storage may ultimately come to be a very large part of the cost of atomic power. This is a problem that has not yet been faced up to We do have estimated costs for chemical reprocessing but we don’t</p>
<p>processed to remove the problems: one, the cost o</p>
<p>about the proposed 500,000-kilowatt - 3</p>
<p>Apc authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 293</p>
<p>know how correct they are. The balances are, as is true of everything q else in atomic energy and in other new technical concepts, that it will be considerably greater than the figures originally mentioned. This has been true of everything whether it is atomic power, airplanes, air- eraft carriers, submarines, tanks, missiles, or anything else.</p>
<p>The problem of what. to do with the radioactive wastes must, be considered in terms of its long-range effects—that is to say the effects that may occur hundreds of years, perhaps thousands of years from now, because some of these radioactive wastes have very long half- lives and we cannot sit here and feel we have no responsibility for future generations. Certainly we do have a responsibility to our resent citizens; we have also a responsibility to our future citizens.</p>
<p>us an important advantage of seed-blanket cores is that they re-</p>
<p>uire less chemical reprocessing than slightly enriched cores.</p>
<p>- Another advantage of a seed-blanket core is that the natural urani- um blanket lasts a long time, with a consequent reduction in fabrica- tion costs which constitute a considerable part of reactor fuel costs.</p>
<p>At Shippingport the original design contemplated we would get a life of about 8,000 full power hours out of the blanket. Actually, by the time we deplete the fourth seed. we will have obtained over 27,000 full power hours out of the blanket. This corresponds to ana verage burnup of 9,000 and a maximum burnup of 36,000 megawatt-days per ton of the natural uranium oxide. ; . It is these most encouraging results that have led us to consider a much larger atomic powerplant utilizing the seed-blanket concept.</p>
<p>The pe uepert plant is presently rated at 60,000 electrical kilo- tts. At the time we began designing it in 1954 its size was deter-</p>
<p>ned by the largest pressure vessel we would get from American in- ry. As the committee knows, we are currently designing a new acement core for the Shippingport reactor which will have a ca- ty of 150,000 electrical kilowatts instead of the ori ginal 60,000 kilo- ts. This core is expected to generate 514 times as much energy € first core was designed to produce. lere Is one bit of philosophy I believe worth mentioning about rtaking any sort of design. For example, Mr. Chairman, if you say to me “I would like you to build a large reactor of about aa to 500,000 kilowatts, could you do it,” I would answer “Yes. 1 the knowledge and experience I now have I could design and it. But I see no purpose at the present stage of development of power merely to build reactors for the sake of building them.” country has plenty of coal right now and the development of 1¢ energy has not reached the stage where, with the exception of : we . Ioan agi design and build reactors, in my opinion, 7. Fe, 1f you ordered me to do so I could build a large reactor Be nowledge we have learned at Shippingport and this new ve work. Nevertheless I think that would be foolhardy, a ae Stage of the atomic energy program we should build</p>
<p>Aon r ay only if they advance reactor technology. the ot and, if you were to tell me “We would like you to un- ears Aaada and evelopment of a reactor to be completed about now and which will incorporate many new advances,”</p>
<p>294 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>then I would put a group of my people on the job. By the fact that we would have a considerable number of experienced people working on the. design—people knoweldgeable in atomic power they would soon start coming up with ideas, and«you would find, as has invariably been the case, these new ideas would throw out many of the present ones. Consequently, by taking several years to develop a new plant incorporating new and advanced technology, you would end up with a much better plant than if you had merely proceeded to build the plant based on the then existing technology.</p>
<p>This is what always comes out of development. The chances are, if we are permitted to go ahead with this program and you give us our head, the result that will come out of the development 5 years from now will be completely different than anything I, or your committee, or the Atomic Energy Commission or the people in the laboratories presently envision. It would be my objective to turn our talents to the project and give you a reactor plant 5 years from now which will be just as much in the lead in atomic energy as the Shippingport re- actor was when it started operating. Otherwise, I would not at all care to become involved in a project whose objective was merely to build a reactor. I have no desire to devote my time, the time of my engineers, or the time of the scientists and engineers in the laboratories to a project of building a reactor just for the sake of building one. We have too many important things to do.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. To complete this development you speak of, you would have to build the reactor itself eventually—not for the sake of the building, but because you could not learn the lessons unless it were actually built and operated.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir. However, I would not want to commit myself to building the reactor this year or next year or even the year after. I would want to devote about 5 years to the design and development. There probably would be a time, say 3 years from now, 3 years after I started where I could come to this committee and say “I now see my way clear to go in a certain promising direction, and it is wise to start construction”—but even after we started con- struction, we would still introduce new ideas as we went along.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. In other words, you would not be going blind. You would want to know certain things that were fundamental before you started.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think you have highlighted the issue very well, sir. I am merely discussing whether we should start. building a reactor immediately or wait 3 years. I can build youone now. Ican build you a reactor just as well as any one else. I have just as good talent in my headquarters organization and in my laboratories as any place in this country. It would be foolhardy to start building the re- actor plant at once for the reasons I have given. I would not want to undertake such a project. In my opinion, it would be a waste of Government funds.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. As you say, you went along in a couple of years and you came up with some problem that was very sticky. I would like to know your approach. Do you spend any amount of money to overcome that problem, or would you say:</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It would depend on the problem and the ad- vantages that would accrue from solving it.</p>
<p>ABC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 295</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am not too certain that we are justified in throwing a lot of money into solving some problem when possibly it might be much better spent on some other approach. .</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovsr. Certainly if the committee has some other pro)- ect they think had better be done rather than this, I think you should do Representative Hosmer. I am talking about the moment 2 years from now when you run into a sticky problem that is going to take $20 million to solve and it will not necessarily at that point be a com- mittee decision. It will be more yours, I imagine. Would you be</p>
<p>illing at that point to give up the project ?</p>
<p>i ira RreKovER, ‘Yes, sir, i have done this in the past, Mr. Hosmer. I have so far produced the only viable sodium cooled atomic powerplant in the world. It worked successfully for 2 years and I personally terminated the project after it had worked well for 2 years.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will I use my energies or those of my people on any work I do not consider worthwhile. _ ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are not going to parallel this pro-</p>
<p>gram, the seed blanket, with something else, are you?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I am talking of a seed-blanket con- cept. Unquestionably we will run into difficulties but the only time you make progress in any field whether it is atomic power or anything else, is when you run into difficulties and solve them, and don’t run away from them. That is the only way you can learn.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. The point I am making is I hope you would not be Quixotic about it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. To answer your question, I think I can point to my record. I have 43 nuclear power reactors operating right now which is more than twice as many as all of the other operational power reactors in the world. I do not believe anyone on the committee can say I have ever continued with a program that was no good. I would not do so, even if you urged me to. I would not even do it for you, Mr. Hosmer.</p>
<p>Technical advantages of shippingport reactor</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrrep. Admiral Rickover, I think it would be well to establish for the record at this point the importance from a techno- logical standpoint of the existing Shippingport reactor. Would you give us, in your opinion, an analysis of the contribution which the Shippingport reactor has made, from a technical sense, to the reactor art ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The greatest fiatiory given me so far is that practically everybody both here and abroad has copied the technology of the Shippingport reactor. For example, the fuel being used in practically all large civilian water-cooled reactors is uranium oxide. The development and largescale manufacture of uranium oxide was pioneered in the Shippingport reactor and this has been a most sig- nificant contribution to the reactor art. About 2 years ago this same question was asked of me in this committee, and [ submitted for the record a large number of contributions the Shippingport reactor had made. They include developments in nuclear physics, heat transfer, metallurgy, hydraulics, reactor control, large reactor vessels and their</p>
<p>296 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>closures, large canned rotor pumps, refueling, and so forth. When we started up the Shippingport reactor, we found that as a result of our extensive development and test work practically everything came within a few percent of what we had predicted. , ‘</p>
<p>I am not saying that because this is anything to brag about, but because when you have done experiments, when you have conducted developments and the finished product turns out in accordance with what you predicted, then you are in a position to measure and learn from what you have done. '</p>
<p>_I believe it is of interest. to note that at the time we started the Ship- pingport reactor the technical and scientific community considered that water technology was not. the route to follow for civilian reac- tors. The General Advisory Committee also considered that water reactors should not be pursued. I believe the General Advisory Com- mittee has made other errors once or twice; they certainly did make an error in this case. Now, there is general agreement that the water- cooled reactor route is a promising approach if not the most promising.</p>
<p>Chairman Hottrretp. Would it be a fair statement. for me to say that the basic technology of atomic reactors stems principally from the development work, the experimental work and the operational procedure of the Shippingport reactor ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; I think that is a fair statement, and I believe you will find that people like Mr. William Webster, who is operating the Yankee atomic powerplant in New England, will confirm this—I believe he has already told this to your committee. I believe you will find other knowledgeable people who will say the same. I think any group responsible for a development such as Ship- pingport would be accorded this sort of statement.</p>
<p>My purpose in undertaking the development of a large 500,000- kilowatt power reactor is to create a similar situation, to achieve major advances in the reactor art.</p>
<p>Purpose in further work on seed-blanket core</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irme p. In other words, you are thinking about a laboratory type of reactor, the purpose of which will be similar to that of the Shippingport in the development of advanced stages of technology which will not only be applicable to the seed-in-blanket concept which you propose but will be of value to all of the different types of reactor art.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir. It. would be a large-scale development facility with emphasis being plated on learning; learn- ing all sorts of lessons which would be applicable to all types of civil- ian power reactors.</p>
<p>For example, the Shippingport reactor has several hundred instru- ments inside the core, so we can tell at all times what is going on. A great, deal of expensive and painstaking development work had to be carried out to develop these instruments. From my standpoint, without such core and plant instrumentation there would be no point in building a reactor, since I would not be developing or proving out advanced technology—technology which will benefit the entire reactor</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 297</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irretp. What you are telling this committee at this time is that you want the opportunity to start with the knowledge that you now have a completely advanced new type—not a new type but a completely .advaneed stage of the seed-in-blanket principle in a larger—in what would eventually be a large type reactor, and larger size reactor, but which would be basically as important to the art of the future as the Shippingport has been in the past.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right, sir, and I will repeat what I said previously. If your committee ordered me to build a 500,000-kilowatt reactor based on what I now know, I would not do it except under duress. I would not think it worth the doing.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirieip. We are not asking you to do it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovrr. I know, I am posing a hypothetical situation,</p>
<p>sir. Chairman Hortrretp. We want to clear for the record that what you are asking for is a program of research and development along a cer- tain line based on proven principles. And you are also assuring this committee that in your good judgment you would bring to this art benefits commensurate with the benefits that have been brought in the past by the original Shippingport reactor.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right, sir. We would expect to under- take full- and large-scale developments in all phases of reactor tech- nology including physics, heat transfer, hydraulics, mechanical design, and so forth in order to obtain as much energy as possible from a given volume of natural uranium. We would investigate many concepts, and at a certain time there would have to be a cutoff because as is always true in development, the further you go along the more you wish you could go on; but unless you terminate development and start building you get nowhere.</p>
<p>Chairman Hotirieip. You are further stating if at any time along the route whether it be at the end of one year or the second or third year, if you come to the conclusion that you have embarked upon an unprofitable venture, you will come to this committee and say so.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrrerp. And if you run into difficulties which you think can be solved with a reasonable amount of support that you will then solve those difficulties.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; and in giving you this assurance I respectfully ask that you remember I have for many years always operated with your committee in this way.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Admiral, at this very point, based upon the wise experience you have had with reactors, particularly with the Ship- pingport reactors, where the costs are very high, do you presently have confidence that if you do embark upon this venture you might or have the hope that you will achieve competitive power ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. Ido not.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Then this is strictly a gamble at any rate.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think I have just as much chance of achieving truly competitive power as any one else, sir.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Then why are we doing it ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. Because atomic power has not yet reached the Stage, in my opinion, where it is competitive; but if you don’t proceed with its development you never will get competitive atomic power.</p>
<p>836276220</p>
<p>298 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Don’t you think we ought to have some preconfi- dence that after all we may achieve our goal? I realize we can’t forecast to the accuracy of the future but on the other hand we must have a goal in mind before we embark even on*these experiments. What are we trying to achieve?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I can only tell you this: I believe I can get economic atomic power just as fast and as well as any one else. How- ever, I have doubts that some of the promises being made will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Tama student of history. It has been said that a page of history is worth more than a book of logic or argument. I go back to history and read all of the promises for economic atomic power made to your committee during the last 10 years. Almost everyone who has ever come to this committee to sell a reactor idea has sold it on the basis it would be competitive when it was finished. No reactor has yet been competitive.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. When I had a private talk with Billy Webster, whom you mentioned, he said to me in very optimistic fashion in a short period of time, he gaged it between 10 and 15 years, with his re- actor, which is a refinement of the Shippingport reactor, as you al- ready pointed out, that he would achieve competitive power.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If Mr. Webster can achieve it, then I can too because his estimates are based on the technology I developed at Ship- pingport.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. But as you sit there you don’t think you have the confidence that that isso. I don’t care about measuring—I don’t want an argument on this. I am just trying to find out. This would be putting money in an experiment here where the people who are going to utilize this money don’t presently have the confidence that they will achieve the goal.</p>
<p>I don’t say you have to prove it or give us a guarantee but we have to have the confidence at this moment.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. This is like 39 articles to which everyone had to subscribe before he could enter Oxford. They would not let anyone in until he subscribed to them. Then one day a wise student came along and said “I will subscribe to 89 articles as long as you let me in.”</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. I don’t think you would say that. I have a great: deal of confidence in you and you are a competent individual. I am not debating this subject, but I asked you a question once before, what was the incentive for Government money being invested in an enter-</p>
<p>rise that we considered to be a free enterprise that belongs to private industry in this country, and you very ably said that some day our fossil fuel resources are going to run out and we have to think of an alternative method of producing electric power if we are going to maintain out economic standard in the world.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Let me put it another way, Senator Pastore. The cost of electric power is about 1 percent of the total cost. of pro- duction of a finished product. Suppose it went up to 2 percent or 3 percent. Would we stop using electricity because it is 2 or 3 percent ? Supposing the sewage system for your heuse cost 1 percent. Sup- posing the sewage system costs were doubled, would you stop using it ?</p>
<p>No. I think you are being subjected to a distorted viewpoint when</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 299</p>
<p>you hear all of these arguments for economic atomic power and which have been figured so carefully that they are predicting the cost to a hundredth of a mill. The objective in developing atomic power is to develop an alternative source of energy for our fossil fuel resources which must eventually run out.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Regardless of cost?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Regardless of cost, because no modern indus- trial society is viable without large-scale energy resources. That is the basic reason for continuing the development of atomic power. When people talk about competitive nuclear power costs, they take into account Government subsidies, low interest charges, low chemical reprocessing costs, and so forth, which make it very difficult to deter- mine the real cost of atomic power. But when the time comes when you do have any more electricity in your house, Mrs. Pastore will raise the devil with you. She will say, “I don’t care about the cost. I want my electric lights.”</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Not with me, with the electricity charges.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. She will raise the devil with you if you say she can’t have electricity because the costs are higher than they used to be.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. In other words, our incentive at the moment must be to protect our natural resources that one day might run out and that this is an experiment that has to be undertaken regardless of what the cost might be in the hope that we might achieve competi- tiveness.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Senator Pastore, from a purely logical stand- point, we should never use coal or oil because they were created by solar energy 500 million years ago. The oil we use each year took nature 14 million years to create. You need only be a grammar school graduate and start doing a little computation to learn that no matter how much more oil we may find we must eventually run out because the rate of creation of new fossil fuels is so slight. So no matter how large the bank account is, it can’t keep up with the rate at which we are spending. On this basis, we should restrict the use of coal and oil for energy purposes, because it is very wasteful of our natural resources. We should use oil and coal for many other more important things.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. In view of the statement you have just made, do you think that our overall policy implemented by the appropria- tions and the programs that we have instituted thus far that we have lagged.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I don’t think you have lagged in the money you have appropriated. I believe you are the most generous body on earth in that respect. I believe this Congress is the most generous Congress that has existed in all history.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You will subscribe to anything.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Do you feel there has been any slowness on the part of the administrative bodies of the Government in programing this project? _ Admiral Ricxover. I don’t think that this committee has been laggard or backward in urging or in helping the development of atomic power. This certainly has not. been my experience.</p>
<p>300 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. The committee has always gone a step further than the administrative bodies but what I am trying to determine at this time, do you think we are going along fast enough to meet the urgency of which you speak for future generations ? 4</p>
<p>Admiral Rrexover. I think you are going along fast enough as measured by the dollars you appropriate. I think that with the money being spent in this country today for development of atomic power, you should get adequate results. When you will obtain these ade- quate results, I don’t know. But I suggest you not be taken in by the economic aspects which are always being quoted to you. As I have said, a page of history is worth more than a year of argument. I think the committee might study a little bit more of the history of the atomic program and the promises that have been made to you over all these years, and not pay quite as much attention to the immedi- ate and transitory arguments that are made to you on economic grounds.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrorr. Are you disappointed in any way in the progress that. we have already achieved in this field ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would rather not answer that question be- cause I am disappointed in my own progress; I have enough problems of my own, and I cannot take on the woes of other people. I consider I have not made half the progress I should. I would have made even less had I not had the support of this committee.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Then is it lack of manpower or money ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; it is not lack of manpower and it is not lack of money. It is mostly that the Government is not geared up to handle modern science and technology. There are too many people in government today handling jobs for which they are not adequate.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Well, on that note, I will yield to my colleagues.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrrerp. Admiral Rickover, I want to see if I can make an attempt at clarifying what I think the record may convey which I don’t believe it is intended to convey. Your testimony has been that while you will not assure this committee that you can achieve economic power, you believe that with the technology at your command and experience and your assistance and your staff and so forth, that you can come as near to it as any one else.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; I do.</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrm tp. May I ask you this question: Are you con- fident that the type of a reactor which you are working on will, in the end, give you, considering all subsidies and everything else, and I am not talking about fake bookkeeping and there is plenty of it in this field, and our committee is making a study now to find out where the subsidies are and how much they are, and this has never been really crystalized, but. we are going to do our best to do it although I recog- nize the fact that this may be most difficult to do. But considering the hidden subsidies that are involved in other types of reactors as well as in your own, do you believe that your type of advocacy will bring</p>
<p>us to the field of economic power as efficiently as other types which are</p>
<p>advocated ?</p>
<p>I will use any of the boiling water, the fast breeder, the sodium- graphite type, the gas cooled, any of these types now. I recognize in asking you this question that I am probably giving you an opportunity</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 301</p>
<p>to present your arguments for your case, but we have heard the argu- ments from others that their type of reactor is superior, and I think we have a right to hear your arguments on the subject and we will be the judge as to who makes the best argument.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I will not say any reactor I propose to under- take will be superior to anyone else’s. I will only tell you that I will see to it that any reactor I am responsible for designing will have as a main objective the conservation of natural resources. That is my measure of economy, and not a promise that it will be one one-hun- dredth of a mill or so cheaper than another reactor. Suppose I and another man go to a shoemaker and each of us says to him: Make me a pair of shoes. But let us also suppose the shoemaker has an uncle who pays some of his expenses. Naturally he can afford to make the shoes cheaper for the other man than for me.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrtevp. I am taking into consideration uncle’s help, and I am talking about Uncle Sam now.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickxover. The only true measure of economy is to deter- mine if we are being prudent with the bank account of natural re- sources that we have and must preserve for future generations, and to decide whether these resources are being used in the most economic manner. On that basis, I can answer that my reactor will be at least as economic as any other. But I do not guarantee that it will be just as “economic” as another if you want to get down to hundredths of a mill. The answer you get that way all depends on what system of arithmetic you use, and whether you are keeping one set. of books or two sets of books. I am not competent to compete in that sort of contest.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.irm.p. This committee has been skeptical and his- tory will bear our skepticism was justified in many of the claims made before this committee, and I for one appreciate the fact that you are sone enough to say what you think on this point and let the record stand.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Holifield, it would be very easy for me with the opening you have given me to make promises that might sound pleasing. I could very easily make such promises, but I will not be- cause I value the respect and confidence this committee has always accorded me. I give you equal respect by not telling you something I do not fully believe. I would rather give up this project altogether than do a thing like that. I have dealt with your committee for a good many years, and I am sure that at no time have you ever found a case where I ever gilded the lily or said any optimistic thing—in fact, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Admiral Rickover, I would like to get into some other areas we have not discussed yet. You pick a 500,000-kilo- watt plant. Why do you pick that size?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I selected that size because I conceive that the true function of atomic power is to constitute a series of large load centers throughout the United States. I do not think small atomic powerplants can ever use natural resources economically. Again I am not talking about money. I am talking about using up our bank account of irreplaceable natural resources,</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. This is an experiment rather than a pro- duction reactor as I understood your testimony.</p>
<p>302 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It will only be experimental to the extent that it will be designed with the latest technology and will be heavily in- strumented. That is what I mean by experimental. On this basis, if you want to, you can call the Shippingport reactar experimental; yet the Shippingport reactor has run continuously longer than any other reactor has ever run.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What you stated are the anticipated ben- efits of this project as such things as new knowledge in heat transfer and flow and flux distribution. You stopped there.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I could list many other technical advances we would hope to achieve.</p>
<p>_tbpresentative Hosmer. Those are technical rather than opera- tional.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. From an operational standpoint Duquesne Light, which operates the Shippingport plant, states this plant is easier to operate than any other plant they have. There is no question that the large plant we are considering would be a fully operational plant generating power for civilian use. It would be different only in the sense that it would incorporate all the latest ideas we had developed and be heavily instrumented so we could learn from it as we are currently learning from Shippingport.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but I still get back to the question of 500,000 kilowatts, and why is it necessary for 500,000 kilowatts to get these technical advancements you are speaking of?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Mr. Hosmer, as I indicated before, it is my opinion, and I think this is generally true of the whole atomic energy industry, the problems connected with the development and design of large atomic power stations are different than those for small size stations.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I know you want large stations, but that is</p>
<p>another question and then we get ourselves into the middle of the argument of public versus private power, and so on. _ Admiral Ricxover. The question of whether it is private or public is not my field. I personally think the Shippingport formula is a good one for an experimental reactor the Government builds and a private utility operates.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you have any thoughts on what you do with this 500,000-kilowatt: power ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Where it would be located ?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; that is not my job. I think that is something your committee would decide.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. It is going to be located in a TVA system that might be one element of congressional consideration. If it were located some places, there might be another.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. You appreciate that this is an area I am not. competent to comment upon, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Let’s get back to the technical arguments, and let me ask you if you couldn't substantially make these technical advancements with a plant of smaller size.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; the design and operational problems that have to be solved for plants of large physical size and power</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 303</p>
<p>rating are quite different than for smaller size plants. We have seen this often for example in the different designs we have had to date even for our naval reactors. The minute you make a change in size you run into all sort of new problems. This was again demonstrated at Shippingport in practically all phases of the design, development, and fabrication of the second core. Here the power rating was in- creased from the 60,000 electrical kilowatts of the first core to 150,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>If there are to be large atomic powerplants, and a lot of people believe that they are definitely required, then you must go ahead and develop, design, and build such large plants. That is the only way we will learn.</p>
<p>Estimated cost of seed-blanket reactor</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What is your idea of the possible total cost of this project ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I think the research and development would probably total about $95 million and it would probably cost about $100 million to build the entire plant. I believe a repeat plant would cost about $90 million. These are very rough figures.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. A what ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. By repeat plant, I mean a duplicate plant of the first one, and thus its cost would be somewhat less.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then the thing would have to be operated for some period of time.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Several years; yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. How many years would you say?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I would hope that with the kind of core we expect to develop, the natural uranium blanket would last for many years—5 to 10 years. And it would only be necessary to renew the seeds during this period. Right now at Shippingport after more than 4 years of operation, the original blanket of natural uranium is still in place operating with its third seed. If it were not for the need to test out the second and more advanced core which has a rating of 150,000 kilowatts as compared to 60,000 kilowatts of the first core, we could have run this original charge of natural uranium with several more seeds. This is the advantage of the seed-blanket concept—-it provides a core where the natural uranium fuel is capable of lasting for many years and thus produce a large amount of energy per unit volume— on the average well over 20,000 MW D-ton.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you have an estimate of how much a year it would cost the Government net to operate this plant?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I do not; any determination of net operating costs would have to take into consideration the money that is paid back by the utility company for the steam they receive from the reactor—such as at Shippingport for example.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But the money you are getting back cer- tainly isnot covering all the costs that go into it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It isn’t, because at Shippingport, apart from operating the reactor we also carry out extensive tests and experiments to develop and further reactor technology. As you well know, Mr.</p>
<p>304 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Hosmer, much of our present knowledge and understanding of water reactors has come from this project, and continues to come from it.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You have roughly a plant that is five times or more the potential of Shippingport ‘ '</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. A 500-megawatt electrical plant would have about 314 times the capacity we expect to have at Shippingport when we install the second core.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. We have $200 million invested in this thing in R. &amp; D. and construction and we have to operate it for 10 years. I am trying to get a final figure of what we pay for what we finally get out of it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. At this early stage of the project, I don’t be- lieve any figures would be too meaningful</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. It costs $10 million a year.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I don’t think it would cost that much at all. I believe the current cost to the Government for operating Shipping- port has averaged about $2 million over the past 3 years. However, when allowance is made for the payments received from the utility for the steam they use to generate electricity, the net annual cost to the Government during these 3 years has averaged about $100,000. The cost: of operating a reactor plant is not necessarily a function of its size. It is much more a function of the experiments, tests, and analysis you perform to determine the potential of the plant and how it can be further improved.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but at the same time I know as thoughtful as you are in these maters you must anticipate that after you get it constructed there is going to be some kind— have some idea of the order of magnitude of the experimental costs.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If I could answer these questions it would no longer be a development. As I stated before, at the present stage of this project, any figures would be meaningless.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I think we are entitled to have some idea whether it is going to be a quarter of a billion or half a billion dol-</p>
<p>lars that the Government puts into this.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I have given you an estimate of the amount I believe will be required for the research and development. I also ~~ given you an estimate for the cost of construction of such a plant.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That brings it up to about $200 million so you are getting close to a quarter of a billion.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is right.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then we have 10 years operating the plant that. costs us $400,000 per installed kilowatt.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. As I mentioned earlier, if the Shippingport- type formula were to be used, the utility operating the plant would pay the Government for the steam they were using to generate elec- tricity.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are some time going to be selling your kilowatts at less than it costs you to produce.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Probably so, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. So you are going to have a net operating cost over this period of time.</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 305</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I think this estimate applies to anyone op- erating a reactor today. . .</p>
<p>Represantative cea. Do you think it would be possible at all to furnish us an estimate on that? ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover: Mr. Hosmer, the plant we are talking about. has not yet been developed. I don’t even know yet what it will look like. Any estimates I might make would have little substance. a like stating that when parents get together and decide to have a child, they ought to know what year he is going tobe President. ‘at?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I don’t think that is quite fair in relation to a matter of extrapolating costs out. If you took the cost of Ship- pingport and multiplied it by 5—— ; ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It does not work that way, sir. The operating cost of a reactor plant is not a direct function of its size—and with regard to performing tests and experiments, you would not require more technical people just because the plant 1s five times larger in output. You generally have about the same number—it does not take significantly more people to operate and test a large plant than it does a small one.</p>
<p>Production of plutonium net in seed-blanket core</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. In the operation of this plant what do you estimate the production of fissionable atoms for fissionable atoms used ? . . * - .</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. To give you an idea of this, I might mention our experience at Shippingport. We expect by the end of the fourth seed to have generated over 53 percent of the total core energy from the natural uranium blanket which has been in the reactor since its original startup over 4 years ago. A major portion of this enbtey comes from the fission of plutonium which has been formed in the natural uranium. ; . .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That is not the same thing. That is not the question I am asking. I am asking what the regeneration ratio is.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I believe that it is on the order of 80 percent as it is in most thermal reactors. The exact number would depend on the design and this of course is one area among many others that we would be investigating in the project I am proposing.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are burning more than you are pro- ducing by way of fissionable materials. —</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. This is correct at Shippingport and for that matter in all operating reactors today. .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Of that that you are producing, you are burning 53? ——</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. At Shippingport, about 53 percent of the total energy produced in the reactor is generated by the natural uranium blanket. This energy comes largely from the fission of plutonium that is formed in the blanket. There is no operating reactor In the world today that is not burning more fissionable atoms than it pro- duces. ; ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but you said there is an 80 percent regeneration ratio.</p>
<p>306 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I was referring to the ratio of the total atoms of fissionable material produced to the total atoms of U-235 fissioned.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Of the fissionable atoms you produce, then I take it you burn 53 percent ? ‘ ,</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. The 53 percent'refers to the fraction of total core power generated by the natural uranium blanket.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You tell me you are getting 53 percent of your power out of your blanket.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That is correct; 47 percent of the total core energy is produced by the seeds. The remaining 53 percent is pro- duced by the natural uranium blanket, a major portion of which is generated by the fissioning of the plutonium formed in the natural uranium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That is what I was getting at. But when you produce plutonium, you are burning your uranium to do it.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. And for every uranium atom you burn you make eight-tenths of a plutonium atom?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. This figure is of the correct order and is gen- erally true of all thermal reactors.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are getting 53 percent of your power and you must be burning about 53 percent of them.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Fifty-three percent of the total core power is generated by the natural uranium blanket and a high fraction of this 1s produced from the fissioning of plutonium formed in the natural uranium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then do you plan to recycle the blanket?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Not necessarily, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Recover the other?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Whether the blanket is reprocessed or not would depend largely on the cost of reprocessing and the value of plutonium. One of the important features of the seed-blanket core is to obtain as much energy as possible out of the natural uranium blanket so that. when you have depleted it, there is little need to reprocess it. because it will then contain but a relatively small amount of plutonium. Most of the plutonium formed was burned in place to generate power. This is why seed-blanket cores are less sensitive than other designs to varia- tions in the cost of processing or the value of plutonium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You said there is 47 percent in your plu- tonium that did not burn.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I stated that 47 percent of the total core energy was generated by the seeds; the remaining 53 percent was produced by the natural uranium blanket.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But you don’t burn all of the plutonium in your blankets?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. No, there is always a little left.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you get a burnup rate of 90 percent? You don’t get that high, do you?</p>
<p>Mr. Mano. It would be fairly high and it would depend on the particular design.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What do you mean by particular design ? Two percent is fairly high for some people.</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 307</p>
<p>Mr. Manopiu. The results from Shippingport may give you some feel for this. In the Shippingport design, as indicated previously, about 53 percent of the power 1s produced by the natural uranium blanket. At the start, this blanket contained 7 grams of U**? in every kilogram of natural uranium. At the end of four seeds of operation, every kilogram of natural uranium will contam 7 grams of plutonium anda much smaller amount of U***.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. But how many grams do you burn?</p>
<p>Mr. Manpi. I do not have the number in grams. Percentagewise slightly over 50 percent of the plutonium atoms formed would be fissioned in the present Shippingport core at the end of four seeds. In a design where 65 percent of the total core power 1s generated by the blanket over 70 percent of the plutonium atoms formed would be fissioned.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If you want those figures, we can get them.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Would it be 14 or 50 or 10? What order of magnitude are we talking about here? ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Could we work up the figures and put them in the record? ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. That would be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Mr. Manvu.. Mr. Hosmer, the question I think you want answered is the following : For every atom of enriched uranium that 1s destroyed in the core, how many atoms of plutonium are formed and what percentage of the plutonium is burned up. The total number of plutonium atoms formed for every atom of U2** destroyed will be under 0.8—probably 0.7 at Shippingport at the end of four seeds. This number increases as the fraction of core power from the blanket increases.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I thought the 0.8 of a percent was what your production of plutonium in a blanket against uranium 235 burned. ” Mr. Manpu. That is correct. In a seed-blanket core, the seed— which is the small fully enriched portion of the core—keep driving neutrons into the blanket. These neutrons fission part of the enriched U285 which occurs naturally in natural uranium, and transforms the natural uranium into plutonium which in turn fissions. This is why the blanket of a seed-blanket core has a very long life. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are not burning the natural uranium ?</p>
<p>Mr. Manpi. You first burn a part of the enriched uranium natu- rally occurring in the blanket. ; ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understand that, but that is a negative factor. You are trying to make money on what you generate.</p>
<p>Mr. Manprz. At Shippingport with the first core, for example, at the end of the fourth seed each kilogram of natural uranium in the blanket. will contain 7 grams of plutonium and 2 grams of U**. Thus the blanket will contain just as much plutonium at the end of four seeds at is had U2** at the very beginning. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. On that basis you are talking about plu- tonium ? .</p>
<p>Mr. Manpr. The total number of atoms of plutonium produced per atom of U*** fissioned depends on the design of the core and spe- cifically on the fraction of power generated by the blanket. Admiral Rickover mentioned the number 0.8. This number could vary from</p>
<p>308 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>about 0.6 to 1.0 depending on the power fraction. For a 65-percent blanket power fraction, the number is practically 1.0.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are burning two different fuels. You are attempting to burn your 0.7 of U*** and you are attempting to manufacture some plutonium and burn it in place.</p>
<p>Mr. Manou. Yes, sir; and the reactivity of the blanket is main- tained by the fact that while you are burning the naturally occurring U5, you are also forming plutonium. ‘As I mentioned before, at the end of four seeds the Shippingport blanket will contain 2 grams of U* and 7 grams of plutonium in every kilogram of natural uranium.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are confusing it. Iam trying to find out how much of the plutonium that you manufacture you are burn- ing and that isthe figure the admiral said he would furnish.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We will furnish that figure, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You said to the effeet——</p>
<p>Chairman Houirrerp. Excuse me; are you asking the admiral now to give figures based on experience with the present Shippingport reactor or based on what he thinks the concept of a new type, larger- type reactor will be? I wanted to get that clear.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I understood at this point he could not: giveusa figure. I would like to have both.</p>
<p>_Admiral Rrcxover. I can only give you the figure for the Ship- pingport reactor.</p>
<p>Chairman Hortrrerp. I wanted to make that clear. There was testimony before our committee that if this new study turned out properly or constructively that there would be considerable increase in the burnup in the blanket.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.rrtetp. I wanted to be sure we are talking about the same thing here.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Let me phrase the question which IT am sup-</p>
<p>osed to answer. I will put into the record the figure which Mr.</p>
<p>osmer asked for the Shippingport reactor at the end of four seeds of operation. This figure is based on approximately 53 percent of the total core power being generated by the natural blanket. In the large reactor plant I am proposing to work on, I expect that as much as 65 percent of the total core power will be generated by the natural uranium blanket. : .</p>
<p>(Subsequently, the following statement was submitted by Admiral Rickover for the record :)</p>
<p>At the end of four seeds of operation, the Shippingport core will have pro- duced a total of 145 kilograms of plutonium of which 75 kilograms will have been fissioned, leaving a net of 70 kilograms in the core.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You don’t expect to go betier than one?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I think perhaps the confusion results from the difference between a conversion reactor and a breeder reac- tor. In a breeder you create more fissionable atoms than you had when you started; but in a conversion reactor, you have less fissionable atoms than you had when you started.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You have to get into the fast reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; the difference between conversion and</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 309</p>
<p>breeding is when you pass the 1.0 mark. No one is contemplating any thermal reactor today that will do that. .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Isn’t this fast ceramics reactor contem- plating that ? ;</p>
<p>Admiral ‘Ricxover. Yes, sir; but I am talking about the thermal power reactors. One problem in the design of breeders is that they re- quire tremendous quantities of fissionable material. None of the re- actors now being considered as having a major role in the atomic power program for the next 10 years or more are breeders. They are all converters. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You stated the most economic use of natu- ral resources is your standard of economy. ; ;</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. That certainly is one of my main considerations.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Under that standard it seems to me you would be getting into the breeder field. ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I believe a breeder—even if practical—is a very long way off. What I am proposing is the design and development of a large reactor that can be placed in service in about 5 to 6 years and which will furnish the necessary technology for the large nuclear powerplants that will be built in the next 10 to 15 years. ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. If you are going to go after something that is really economic, it seems to me you should go after something that gives you better than 1.0. ; ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The breeder-type reactor is an entirely different concept. I expect you will have to spend many, many millions of dollars and many, many years of effort before a practical breeder re- actor is obtained. I do not believe it would be wise to depend on the ultimate practicability of breeders, and design and build no other types at this time. I have heard no one, in or out of the AEC, make such a statement. This is not the issue in this case.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. AEC has received a proposal for a fast ceramic reactor. They claim they can do essentially what you are going to do for around $15 or $20 million.</p>
<p>Chairman Houtrmxp. Wait a minute. I would like to know about this proposal.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. This is the one the people in the other room discussed with us. .</p>
<p>Mr. Ramey. It would not be until 1978 until you had a prototype in operation.</p>
<p>Chairman Hottrtetp. Those are dreams. It is not a proposal before this committee to build that type of reactor.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am trying to evaluate what. we are trying to do here. The admiral feels we should not use oil, we should be using uranium, and I am trying to get to the point of why shouldn’t we be trying to use uranium where we are doing a good job of breeding rather than using it up as this plant should do.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.trtevp. Did you say we should not use oil ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I said it is foolhardy to use oil or coal if we could use something else, sir. .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Do you desire to save as much of these natural resources as possible?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think that is a most important objective but we must go about it in a realistic and practical way.</p>
<p>310 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>_Representative Hosmer. Because of the recoverable aspects of it. You did not tell us not to.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No. We must go about this in a practical way. ae you were to carry it to an extreme we would all-have tq walk home</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I would like to evaluate this since we are getting into an expensive project such as this. Do you feel that we should conserve it because we use it up and then the future gen- erations do not have anything?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Roughly 25 years ago there wasn’t any other source of energy in sight. It was all conventional and then all of a sudden nuclear fission develops. How about fusion ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. It may come, but I would say it is a very long way away.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Then we have done all of the saving for nothing.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If you were sure that you are going to obtain energy some other way, then this committee would be wise to stop all development of atomic power.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am trying to bring out that there are other considerations. I seem to be the only one on my side of the committee.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You have to be practical in deciding how you go about conserving our natural resources. The steps we envision today may only be good for 20 or 30 years when we can develop some better ways of obtaining our energy requirements. But that does not mean we should do nothing in the expectation that there will be a better way of conserving our natural resources. For example some people think we can solve the population problems on earth by sending people off to the planets, but this has yet to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>Possible advantages of seed-blanket core</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I would like to get back again to types of anticipated benefits from this project could possibly. he achieved by a smaller project. ey</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. The characteristics of a reactor core are very much dependent on its size and geometry. One of the main objectives of the project is to obtain as much energy as possible from the natural uranium blanket; the size of the core is most important for this consideration. The physics problems are different, control problems and stability problems of a different nature have to be resolved ; differ- ent types of thermal, mechanical and hydraulic problems are gen- erated because of size. Our experience in the naval and Shipping- port programs fully confirm this. In this connection, I do not know whether the committee has yet been informed, but. about a week ago we reached full power on the destroyer prototype which your cae mittee authorized about 4 or 5 years ago. This reactor project took years to design and develop—the core was of different physical size and power output than other cores. Many different reactor prob-</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 311</p>
<p>lems had to be resolved and the technology we had at the time was not sufficient to solve them. We are placing two of these reactor plants on a destroyer and that destroyer will be capable of steaming 150,000 to 180,000 miles at full power. This reactor took a tremendous amount of work because there were differences in it from our pre- vious designs. The same thing is going to apply on a much larger scale on this large civilian reactor which I am envisaging. I want to incorporate advanced concepts in it. I don’t yet know what these advanced concepts are going to be.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirtecp. At the present time you are not advocating building their type of a reactor?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir.</p>
<p>Study to determine feasibility of seed-blanket approach</p>
<p>Chairman Houmrerp. You are advocating a study to determine whether such a reactor would be feasible some time in the future and you are advocating it in a step-by-step program, seven million and a half for the first step and then if the Atomic Energy Commission and the committee decides that you have made progress or that it looks promising we may take another bite at it, maybe $5 million or $10 million and 3 or 4 years from now with all of these ifs in between, if we come to the point where we think it justifiable you would come forward and advocate a reactor and you think at this time it might be between 400,000- or 500,000-kilowatt size but you don’t know today whether it will be 800,000 or 300,000, do you?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Conversely, I would say that if at the end of the year, before I spent this initial appropriation, if it looks to me that this project is not worthwhile, I would come and give you my conclu- sion. I would not wait.</p>
<p>Chairman Houirrerp. I want the record to be very clear what we are considering today is a $7.5 million appropriation for a study of this problem. We have done this before in many instances. We have authorized studies of different designs. Later on some of those studies have been turned down and later on some of them have been im- plemented. I want the record to be clear on that. I don’t want to face an argument on the floor of the House that you advocated the spending of $2 million to come up with this $7.5 million appropria- tion.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. If I did not believe that this project had suffi- cient technical merit to warrant ultimate construction of such a plant, I would not start it. One has to have the courage of his convictions to know what he can do and I am being frank with the committee when I tell you I believe it will come out allright. But I am not advocating</p>
<p>that you today authorize construction or that you appropriate money</p>
<p>for any such construction.</p>
<p>We had the same relationship on the Shippingport reactor. I had to come before this committee every year to get new appropria- tions. I did not have carte blanche to spend money.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I think as long as you are the man who comes up here to get the money there is a certain amount of certitude</p>
<p>that the Congress is going to give it.</p>
<p>312 AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. What you say may be so but I think Congress judges past performance in reaching decisions.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You are mulling around anywhere from 3 to 5 years before you start construction. ‘ ;</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. I think about 3 years. This is an offhand state- ment, sir, I cannot at the present time give you a firmer statement. I have no basis today on which to give you an estimate.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You would not freeze at that point. You would not freeze until some time along in the construction.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. After 214 or 3 years of development work you usually have enough knowledge about the reactor you are designing that you can place the order for the pressure vessel. This is a con- trolling component in the design and construction of the plant. That is one of the first decisions you have to make—how big is the pressure vessel going to be; what are its dimensions.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. The size of your pressure vessel at ‘a maximum on this 500,000-kilowatt reactor ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I fully expect that the reactor I envision will have an output of about 500,000 kilowatts electrical. It may develop later on, as we go along, that possibly it should be larger than that. At that time we would have to make a decision on whether it is worth- while extending the development for another year or so. Normally it is not advisable to do so. When you see that you can make a big advance in technology, you are better off to start in on that.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. There are points beyond which you can- not extrapolate.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. You probably can extrapolate to some extent for 150,000 to 200,000 kilowatts, maybe a little more.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Shippingport ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes, sir. I am referring to the Shippingport reactor where the second core has a rating of 150,000 kilowatts elec- trical.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. You can extrapolate from Shippingport into this?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. If there were a shortage of electric power in the United States and we had to build large nuclear plants as quickly as possible, if that were the case, I could build a larger plant now with the technology we have available.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. We have a rule of thumb from the 202 hearings we learned it was roughly five times as far as you could go in boosting the size. Do you go for that?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir. I think you are getting arithmetic made easy.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. This is a rule of thumb that most people go by and I thought perhaps you were going by it, too.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. No, sir; I have not heard about such a rule. From my experience, I would certainly question its validity.</p>
<p>Chairman Ho.uirmxp. I am glad to learn about this rule of thumb. This is my first knowledge of it.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I never heard of it, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. It states you are getting a thousand mega- watt-days per ton out of the Shippingport plant.</p>
<p>AEC authorizing legislation, fiscal year 1963 313</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We are presently finishing operation with the third seed and expect to install the fourth seed in the fall of this year. At the end of the fourth seed the oe burnup in the blanket will be about 9,000 megawatt-days per ton of UO:.</p>
<p>Repro Hosmer. Would it go on? y</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. We have examined the fuel elements 1n the blanket and they only have about 1,000th of an inch of crud deposit. For all practial pae: a the elements are in excellent condition. As you know, the reactor has about 100,000 individual fuel elements.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Would the Congressman oblige us, if he can, how long he will be?</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am just about through. ;</p>
<p>Senator Pastorr. We have been holding up a lot of witnesses on the authorization bill, and I wonder how long this committee desires to go? These are important people and busy people, and I do not want to hold them here any longerthan wehave to. _ .</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. I am not going to apologize for taking the</p>
<p>_ time.</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. I am not asking anybody to do anything. I just ask the question if the Congressman could tell me just about how long heintendstobe. Task it respectfully. ; ;</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. As soon as I get some information on the life of these fuel elements that is the last question I have. ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. May I answer this question, sir? The Ship- pingport reactor has about 100,000 fuel elements and we designed it so it could operate even if 1,000 of these elements failed. So far, after over 4 years of operation we have had evidence of possible minor defects in only 3 of the 100,000 fuel rods.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. What kind of life would you expect out of these elements? . ;</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. From the examinations we have carried out on the Shippingport natural uranium fuel, I believe I could run the Shippingport blanket for another 4 years. That is, the initial charge of natural uranium could last for as long as about 8 years. It has already operated satisfactorily for over 4 years.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Could the utilization of the natural U** which has been 0.7 of 1 percent down to this 3 percent, does that change your characteristics or does the replacement compensate fully</p>
<p>r it? in id Ricxover. The reactivity of the natural uranium blanket has kept up very well and the reactor has maintained its 60,000- kilowatt electrical capacity.</p>
<p>Representative Hosmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Any questions from the Senator from Vermont?</p>
<p>Senator ArkEN. No, sir. :</p>
<p>Senator Pastore. Questions of the chairman ?</p>
<p>Chairman Horirimtp. No questions.</p>
<p>Senator Pasrore. Thank you very much, Admiral. __</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to talk with you.</p>
