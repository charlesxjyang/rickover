      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this December 1958 speech, VADM H. G. Rickover vehemently argues that education is &quot;our first line of defense,&quot; a realization sharpened by the shock of Sputnik, which exposed America&#x27;s educational deficiencies. He critiques the prevailing &quot;life-adjustment&quot; philosophy in U.S. schools, which he claims undervalues intellectual competence and resists external criticism from non-professional &quot;educationists,&quot; citing figures like Robert M. Hutchins, Aristotle, and DeTocqueville on the importance of public discourse and education. Rickover highlights the &quot;inane trivialities&quot; of some education theses (e.g., &quot;School Camping in New Jersey,&quot; &quot;Baseball Ability&quot;) and contrasts American standards with the higher academic rigor and longer schooling hours of European nations and the USSR, which he attributes to their superior intellectual achievements and commitment to education as national advancement. He concludes by urging American colleges to raise admission standards to compel public schools to improve, echoing Whitehead&#x27;s warning that &quot;the race which does not value trained intelligence is doomed.&quot;</p>

<p>Education - our first line of defense</p>
<p>Since you invited me to discuss my views on American education, I take it for granted that you share my anxiety over its present state and that you believe with me that what goes on in the nation's classrooms is a matter of legitimate concern to every American which he has a right to discuss in public. Robert M. Hutchins warns that &quot;an uncriticized culture will not endure,&quot; and Aristotle, writing in the twilight of Athenian democracy, reminds us that education is every nation's most important business. The education of youth, says this most famous of Plato's pupils, is not merely one among the many concerns to which the lawmaker must &quot;direct his attention,&quot; but the primary one, &quot;for the neglect of education ruins the constitution of the state,&quot;</p>
<p>Hutchins and Aristotle are separated in time by more than two thousand years but their thinking is close because they are both firmly rooted in Western civilization. Their two Statements sum</p>
<p>up the theme of my speech,</p>
<p>Copyright 1958, H. G. Rickover</p>
<p>It took the shock of Russia's Sputniks to bring us to full realization that today the rate of a country's technological progress depends on the quality of its educational system. Not until this shattering of our complacency did we face up to the reality of America's educational deficiencies and talk freely about them in public. We are only beginning to fully grasp the fact that education is our first line of defense which we neglect at our peril.</p>
<p>We might well ask ourselves why an external stimulus was needed to scare us into giving serious thought to the education of our children. Why had we previously paid no attention to ‘ those--and they were not a few--who deplored the deterioration of scholastic standards in our schools and warned that Russia's massive upgrading of her education presented a real danger to. our position of world leadership?</p>
<p>I submit that we were caught by surprise because we did not accord education the place of importance it deserves in our private lives and in public affairs, and because we did not keep ourselves informed on current educational theories and practices through public debate of this all-important national issue.</p>
<p>-Of course, in times of widespread material well-being, people tend to be apathetic about matters which do not seem to</p>
<p>affect their personal comfort and security. This is natural.</p>
<p>When things run smoothly, nobody goes around looking for trouble.</p>
<p>I believe, however, that we in this country are particularly</p>
<p>loath to make national problems our personal business and that we are abetted in this--if not actually pressured into it--by diverse special interest groups which would like us to leave to the &quot;experts&quot; all matters that specially interest them.</p>
<p>We are easily intimidated by pressure groups. some important issues are not freely discussed in public for fear of displeasing such groups. This is not a new thing in this country. As long ago as 1831, DeTocqueville remarked with astonishment that &quot;freedom of opinion does not exist in America,&quot; and Theodore Roosevelt--the greatest teacher of democracy this country ever had--spoke in forceful language against minority groups and warned that we could not tolerate being torn apart by selfish group interests. Despite Roosevelt's warning, I doubt we have fewer minority groups today than existed in his time. Some have disappeared, but new ones have taken their places; many have shown great hardihood and seem to live on forever. Common to all these groups is dislike of public discussion of their particular interests; they realize they cannot win public approval by persuasion. Some groups seek to obtain selfish advantages which run counter to national interest. Others sincerely believe that they know best what is good for the people. Among the latter are to be found groups of professional experts whose work is of a specialized nature or who think that it is.</p>
<p>Knowledge increases so rapidly today that extreme specialization</p>
<p>4s inevitable. This could easily raise a parrier between the</p>
<p>mass of the people on one side and numerous small groups of experts on the other; each little group of specialists seeking to silence public criticism on the grounds that the people are too ignorant to have a valid opinion. We ought not allow such undemocratic viewpoints to prevail. One does not have to be an expert himself to be able to judge whether the expert has done his job satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The American people are now thoroughly aroused about our schools and are forcefully expressing their concern, put powerful educationists are determined to maintain the Chinese wall which they have built around American education. Educational isolation of this country has no counterpart in other advanced nations of the West. Both official and non-official surveys of the educational systems of other countries are published regularly in Evropean countries. We have a federal agency which is charged with disseminating educational data, but I am not aware of similar surveys being put out by them. The only exception seems to be the &quot;Report on Education in the U.S.S.R.&quot; which was published by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in mid-1957. At that, the report was unaccountably delayed, according to its author. Disquieting evidence of Russia's educational progress had been accumulating for eight years prior</p>
<p>to its publication.</p>
<p>Wholly erroneous views of the educational standards and</p>
<p>practices of other countries are unfortunately widespread among American educationists. Lack of interest in education abroad-- which is dismissed as being aristocratic and hence unsuitable to this country--prevents our schools from benefiting by the educational experiences of others. What is done in schools elsewhere may be well worth our attention since it can often be adapted to specific American needs. Educationist parochialism becomes a positive danger to the country when it prevents the leaders of American education from keeping abreast of developments in Russia. Indeed they have been slow to perceive the challenge of Russian education and even slower to admit the threat it represents to our country. In no other way can one explain the amazement and shock publicly expressed by prominent professional educators who finally went to Russia this year to check for themselves. |</p>
<p>As far back as 1954, people outside education had warned of the tremendous educational development in Russia and had urged that we put our own educational system in order. These warnings were airily dismissed as &quot;hysterical&quot; and the warners were told not to interfere in affairs about which they could know nothing-- not having taken the prescribed credit courses in &quot;education,&quot; one must presume! I suppose we should be thankful that at last there has now been a change of viewpoint among some of these recent travelers. &quot;We were simply not prepared for the degree to</p>
<p>which the. U.S.S.R., as a nation, is committed to education as a</p>
<p>means of national advancement,&quot; said one of them. But not every</p>
<p>member of this group came in quest of truth. Unfortunately there was present the type of truculent attitude which is represented by statements such as: I'm here to collect evidence that will prove American schools are superior to the Russian. This reflects the all too common educationist view that the schools are their private business which no one can be permitted to criticize. We have the right to expect of educators that they seek the truth and have the courage to face it. Once the truth is known, there is nothing to keep this country from surpassing any foreign educational system.</p>
<p>The attempt of leading educationists to keep public education a preserve of the &quot;professional&quot; educator lowers the tone of the great educational debate which has been going on since Sputnik. I believe one may fairly say that most critics of American education argue on a level of ideas and facts. They point out where the public, the parents, and the educators have gone wrong, for obviously there would be no educational crisis if there had been no human failures. But rarely do the critics make the educator the sole scapegoat. They do, however, point out what specific educational theories and practices must be changed if we are to bring excellence to American public education; and where educational reform has been blocked by educationists, they pring out this fact. How else are we to make a change for the</p>
<p>petter? .</p>
<p>On the other hand, all too many educationists stoop to the level of personal invective in order to discredit the critics of American education instead of answering the specific criticisms. I have yet to see a well-reasoned, well-documented counterargument which takes up every point raised by the eritics and attempts to prove them wrong. Instead, the whole issue becomes a duel between educationist and eritic in which the educationist is concerned solely with his amour-propre and his job, and the critic is accused of being an ignoramus out to make a lot of money by irresponsible sensationalism. The rights of our children are lost in this undignified attempt to silence criticism at all cost.</p>
<p>What horrifies me is the apparent inability of many educationists to conceive the possibility that one may criticize American education for no other reason than because he is sincerely concerned with the future of our youth; that it is possible to criticize because one believes in American public education, not because one hates it, as educationists imply3 that one may feel there are better educational philosophies than John Dewey's without necessarily being a crackpot or a reactionary. For me, our educational crisis is a matter of such gravity that the heavy-handed vulgarity, the clumsy jocularity to be found in some educationist repartee trouble me greatly. The future of our children is not a fit subject for dialect</p>
<p>stories. What manner of men are these who degrade a serious</p>
<p>éiscussion into tasteless burlesque? There are fortunately not</p>
<p>many who speak in this vein but it is surprising that no voice</p>
<p>is raised from within the fraternity to castigate this deplorable levity. Debates serve a useful purpose only when they are conducted on the level of ideas and facts; then they help clarify the issues. Debates are useless when one side offers no reply</p>
<p>to the arguments of the other, except to impugn the qualifications and motives of its opponent.</p>
<p>To an educationist, a person who is not a &quot;professional&quot; educator can offer no valid criticism since education is not his metier. This is not a sincere argument, for the leaders of American education are extremely intolerant of criticism by members of their own profession as well. A teacher jeopardizes his job if he exercises the right of free speech in a manner implying even mild criticism. I myself and most other critics have received many letters from teachers expressing their deep dissatisfaction with American education but begging not to be quoted by name. Virginius Dabney, Pulitzer prize winner and editor of the Richmond, Virginia Times-Dispatch commented editorially in 1954 on this tacit censorship by the educationist top command: &quot;It is highly disturbing,&quot; he said, &quot;that teachers in good standing feel that they cannot constructively criticize things that are happening in the schools...without risking their jobs. For such thought-conformity to be forced upon teachers, of</p>
<p>all people--the very members of society who are supposed to be</p>
<p>promoting intellectual freedom and the healthful interchange of</p>
<p>opinion--is doubly shocking.&quot;</p>
<p>Educationist interpretation of the term “professional educator&quot; is extremely narrow. Criticism by colleagues on college and university faculties, for example, is not regarded as &quot;professional!&quot; The reason is not hard to find. The best- documented, most clearly reasoned and most interestingly presented--as well as the harshest--criticism of our public schools has come from the pens of academic scholars, and no wonder. To them the inadequacy of the public schools is daily made manifest by the educational deficiencies of students who must be given remedial courses in high school--sometimes even elementary school --subjects before they can be taught at the college level.</p>
<p>As one works his way through mountains of educationist literature one is impressed with the determination of public school men to be independent of the colleges. In this, they differ greatly from secondary school educators abroad. There, the universities set the standard for all education. The academic secondary schools must prepare students to pass the examination for the &quot;leaving-certificate,&quot; without which students are not admitted to universities; in turn, the high scholastic standards of the academic secondary schools influence those of the non-academic secondary schools. In consequence, scholastic standards are higher all around than in this country. We should</p>
<p>soon see marked progress if American colleges performed for</p>
<p>public education the standard-setting service which is performed py universities abroad, and if the men who run our public school system accepted these standards. At least our academically talented children might then receive a secondary school education which would not be wholly out of line with what is now being offered in European schools.</p>
<p>Educationist disparagement of criticism by college professors has rubbed off on some news commentators. For example, the remarks of one of our eminent scholars were recently reported by one commentator solely in terms of the shape and color of the scholar's socks! A debate on American education between one of our &quot;professional&quot; educationists and a college professor of unimpeachable scholarship was reported as follows: eleven lines were alotted to the professor; these slyly hinted that he had no doubt found criticism remunerative, but made no mention of what the professor had said in the debate. But the argument of his opponent was presented in great detail and with ample quotes. Since I have great admiration for the professor, I shall now stoop to personalities myself and say that I found the argument of the educationist extremely poring since it merely echoed the old party line. You know how it goes: There is nothing fundamentally wrong with our schools that could not be instantly remedied by more money; the public must supply this money but keep out of such &quot;professional&quot; matters as curricula,</p>
<p>teacher certification, educational aims and objective, and so on.</p>
<p>Practically every educationist pronouncement contains the</p>
<p>stereotyped claim that our schools are the most democratic and the best; that they are the envy of the world.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, it should be said that there is some evidence that the critics have not been entirely ineffective, in that this particular bit of bragging has of late not been heard quite so often. We are now merely assured that &quot;our best schools are unsurpassed in the world.&quot; I wish I could bring myself to believe that continual invocation of these phrases, in the manner of a solemn incantation, will make them come true.</p>
<p>A favorite gambit used by educationists to discredit lay eriticism deserves mention. The critic is asked: &quot;Would you presume to tell your doctor how to do his job? Why then do you presume to tell the 'professional' educator how to do his?&quot; This argument has superficial persuasiveness and seems to have won friends for the educationist viewpoint. Although the press as a whole eschews the type of biased reporting which is to be found among some commentators, it has not been entirely unaffected by educationist propaganda. Witness the monotonous repetition of the words &quot;blast,&quot; &quot;lambast,&quot; &quot;rant,&quot; &quot;lashes,&quot; and &quot;attack&quot; used by journalists when reporting the arguments of critics--no matter how even-tempered, reasonable, and factual these might be. This is a sort of semantic hitting below the pelt which ought to be outlawed by new &quot;Marquess of Queensbury</p>
<p>Rules for Public Debates on Education!&quot;</p>
<p>Most critics are pretty tough skinned because they are</p>
<p>motivated by a deep concern for our children's future. Even so, making criticism unpleasant, even risky, can sometimes silence it.</p>
<p>In his essay On Liberty, John Stuart Mill tells of an interesting way in which this was accomplished by an ancient people--the Locrians. Being as fond as the next man of maintaining the even tenor of familiar customs and ways of life, put desirous of giving lip service to the noble concept of free speech, the Locrians devised a splendid method which allowed them to eat their free speech cake and have it too. At public meetings anyone could argue for a change in the laws and customs but not before a halter had been placed around his neck. The instant anything he said met with public disapproval, the rope was pulled tight. Thus were the frivolous faultseeker and the reforming crank kept in hand. There are times when I personally have felt a sense of kinship with the Locrian critic!</p>
<p>Since it has been effective in discouraging public debate, let us examine the educationists' &quot;doctor gambit.” The analogy between the &quot;professional&quot; expertise of our public school men and that of our physicians is so tenuous as to render the gambit pointless. One of our great educational deficiencies is the meager professional qualification which suffices in this country to admit anyone to employment in public education below the college level. It is, in particular, quite inferior to that</p>
<p>required of secondary school teachers in other Western nations</p>
<p>who are almost as thoroughly trained as are members of other &quot;learned&quot; professions. In this country, the &quot;professional&quot; knowledge possessed by secondary school officials and teachers cannot be compared with the &quot;professional&quot; knowledge possessed by a licensed physician.</p>
<p>There is indeed a wide gap in medical knowledge between physician and layman. But the required courses in &quot;education&quot; which make up the American educatr's professional study program are not such as to create a wide gap between him and the layman; not, at any rate, if the layman has taken the trouble to inform himself on educational theories, practices and objectives; not, if the layman by reason of being an employer has had practical experience with the products turned out by our schools! The subject at issue is not so difficult to understand as we are led to believe. Nor do we need to be overawed by academic degrees in education for, alas, many are granted for intellectual achievements which are not impressive.</p>
<p>Flexner, one of our most perceptive critics in the field of education, once made a random selection from the Chicago and Columbia University list of theses for M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in education; a devastating conglomeration of inane trivialities having no connection with true scholarship. There was little to choose between the theses on his list but for some reason one in</p>
<p>particular stopped Flexner in his tracks. &quot;I pause for a moment,&quot;</p>
<p>he writes, &quot;to contemplate the thesis 'An Analysis of Janitor</p>
<p>Service in Elementary Schools.' Why Elementary? There are reasons: first, obviously, the title suggests other theses-- and new subjects are in demand, as students multiply--the duties of a junior high school janitor, of a high school janitor, of a college janitor, ete. 'Are these really different subjects” I once asked a professor of school administration. 'Oh, yes,' he replied, 'the lavatory problem, for example, is with small boys quite different from the same problem at the high school level!'&quot; Lest I be accused of talking about what happened in the past, let me give you a few samples of theses for which the degree of Doctor of Education was awarded last year: &quot;School Camping in New Jersey,&quot; &quot;The Predication of Baseball Ability Through an Analysis of Selected Measures of Structure and Strength,&quot; &quot;A Study of Boating and Boating Education in Selected Schools, Colleges, and Universities in the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us not be intimidated by the &quot;doctor gambit.&quot; Public education is a subject well within the grasp of the layman, especially the educated layman. Moreover, it must be remembered that in this country--as in most advanced Western nations-- education is for the most part a tax-supported enterprise and everyone in it is a public servant. One of the important differences between citizens of a democracy and subjects of authoritarian states is that the democratic citizen has the</p>
<p>right as well as the duty to check and evaluate the performance</p>
<p>of public officials, and to express his dissatisfaction when</p>
<p>they do not carry out the mandate of the people or when they discharge their functions unsatisfactorily. Sovereignty lodges in the people, and public servants--whether elected or appointed; federal, State, or local; career or civil service--are all agents of the people. They will be Judged irrespective of whether or not the critic possesses vocational competence equal to that of the public servant. We criticize the police when it is derelict in its duties though we may have no erl minological competence,</p>
<p>We need not be tax experts to publicly--ana loudly--express our views on taxation. My own work is of a highly technical character, but as a sovernment servant my work is at all times Subject to public Scrutiny. It would be calamitous if things ever came to pass in this country where every self-styled &quot;professional&quot; expert could silence public discussion of his work, Simply by claiming that no layman can understand what he is doing. That way lies censorship which in the past, also, arose from claims to infallibility, but which in civilized countries has had to make way for the right of free men to Speak their minds,</p>
<p>The importance of free speech in a democracy cannot be overstated, It is a privilege which may be lost if it is not used. But more important, it is a necessity for insuring good sovernment. In democracies public servants are not born to high office, nor do they hold it by dint of possessing absolute power; they are elected. They will be good or bad, depending on whether</p>
<p>the people who elect them are well-informed, independent in</p>
<p>their judgment, and patriotic enough to put the national interest above personal or group interest. In some countries the national interest prevails by fiat of the few; here it must be maintained voluntarily.</p>
<p>Public debates on national issues are an important part of the democratic process. Through them the citizen is enabled to familiarize himself with facts which he might not have had the time or ability to dig up for himself. By hearing opposing &quot;experts&quot; give their interpretations of these facts and their solutions to the problem under discussion, the citizen discovers all aspects of the issue and is helped to make wise decisions.</p>
<p>In any public debate, the more varied the viewpoints that are aired, the better, Let us disregard the &quot;professional&quot; qualificationsof those who wish to talk about education and concentrate on what they say rather than on who they are.</p>
<p>Though I have never taken a course in &quot;education,&quot; I have been running schools for years, Everyone in my atomic power group has taken a hand at some time or other at teaching what he has first had to teach himself about the new science of nuclear engineering. We have set up schools for our own engineers and for industry people, as well as for the officers | and men who will operate our nuclear ships. In our post-graduate program we teach the exacting requirements of reactor design,</p>
<p>construction, and management. We, too, have come across</p>
<p>deplorable lacunae in the education of our students; like go many</p>
<p>colleges, we have had to give them &quot;remedial&quot; courses! My concern with education predates the Sputniks by several years and sprang from my dissatisfaction with the products of our schools. My work keeps me pretty busy and I am not looking for more things to do. Only a strong motive could have induced me to give up the little leisure I have in order to familiarize myself with our educational problem. I speak on education only because I am anxious about the future of our country, should present educational practices continue. As any engineer would, I noticed many years ago that Russia, with her tremendous new educational program and her single-minded determination to outpace us in science and technology, was gaining momentum at a time when we were losing momentum. This showed up in the constant lengthening of lead time in this country--frox a years during World War II to about ten years today--while in Russia lead time for military hardware had been cut drastically and was now about half ours. Lead time as you know is the time which elapses from inception of a new idea to its utilization in the finished product coming off the production. lines. As an engineer, engaged in pushing through a new engineering project, it has long been obvious to me that we cannot Shorten lead times as much and and rapidly as we must to keep ahead of Russia, unless we find ways to remove the many roadblocks, both technical and non~- -technical, which delay all our attempts at technological breakthroughs, My own work in nuclear propulsion is merely one such instance. The</p>
<p>same roadblocks hinder every one of our new development projects,</p>
<p>be they in jet engines, rockets, missiles, satellites, or attempts to obtain energy from hydrogen fusion.</p>
<p>Nearly all these roadblocks are caused by people whose education has not prepared them for the extremely difficult problems which arise when we seek to progress beyond present levels of technology. At bottom is to be found a too facile faith in the miracles of science which permeates our national mores and causes us to be overly optimistic. I believe it is necessary that we become somewhat more realistic; that we revise our thinking in this respect: a high standard of living is not a gift dispensed by a scientific fairy godmother but something which must be earned by upgrading of the total human personality. Whenever we make an advance in man's age-old effort to utilize the forces of nature, we must simultaneously raise our education, our techniques, and our institutions to a higher plateau. The civilized man has always had to meet higher demands on his total humanity than the primitive man living in an archaic society. Let me illustrate this by an example of past upgradings ina field with which I am familiar.</p>
<p>If you obtain your power from human muscle, wind, or water, you need almost no technical knowledge. To drive a gang of galley slaves, to manage a windmill or water mill does not even require literacy; but putting Faraday's invention of the dynamo to practical use in a central station power plant needed fifty</p>
<p>years of engineering effort by well-trained people. The men</p>
<p>who run such plants use their minds a great deal more and they need much better minds than the qQuondam miller or slave driven, Similarly, from the splitting of the atom in the 1930's, to the bomb in 1945, to the first practical nuclear reactor in 1953, a vast amount of intellectual effort of a high order had to be expended. Everyone involved in research, development, construction, and running of nuclear power plants has had to raise his thinking and his performance to technical and administrative levels well above those required in conventional power plants. Our nuclear engineers had to be more broadly and more thoroughly educated; better grounded in basic engineering principles, in particular, than the average engineer, And, since our reactors were not laboratory models, Since they were expected to propel ships and supply energy to central station power plants, our work also involved many people outside my own group--people in industry and in other government agencies--on whose cooperation we depended. The categorical imperatives of atomic eneray demanded that they too raise their thinking and their actions to higher levels of competence. In particular, what was needed was an upgrading of administrative procedures and of standards of accuracy in industrial production.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that a major part of our time has been taken up with fighting for higher levels of performance which are resisted because. their necessity is not understood.</p>
<p>We have had great difficulty convincing outsiders that more</p>
<p>rigorous standards are essential if nuclear power is to be harnessed safely and efficiently. Resistance arises from what one might call an intellectual toryism--an inflexibility which has its roots in an educational system that does not prepare young péople for life in our constantly changing world; a world</p>
<p>subject to recurrent: bouleversements which rapidly make old</p>
<p>attitudes and procedures obsolescent and demand that we have flexible and versatile minds. If and when we obtain energy from hydrogen fusion, still greater demands will be made on the Sclentific, engineering, and administrative abilities of everyone involved with this new source of power.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the kind of American who thoroughly mastered his environment on the frontier, in a muscle, wind, and water state of technology, would be totally ineffective in the | atomic age which is just around the corner and the fusion age | which is still a way off. Even today, social workers in big cities into which people from our last frontier regions have been pouring are fully aware of the inadequacy of these human beings in an urban environment for which their simpler life has not prepared them,</p>
<p>One consequence of technological progress is that man must use his mind more and his body less. We still think in terms of a more primitive era; we tend to overvalue physical prowess and we most certainly undervalue intellectual competence. This has a</p>
<p>profound effect on our attitudes toward education. The kind of F</p>
<p>Schools that once prepared young people adequately for life</p>
<p>in a less complicated environment are of little use today. Nor do we now need schools which concentrate primarily on adjusting the children of immigrants to a new country; on helping them become Americans quickly and painlessly. Today we must have schools which develop all children--talented, average, and below average--to the highest level of intellectual competence which they are capable; schools which help young people to understand the complex world of today and how it came to be what it is. This means that our schools must return to the traditional task of formal education in Western civilization--transmission of the nation's cultural heritage, and preparation for life through rigorous training of young minds to think clearly, logically, and independently.</p>
<p>My personal experience in developing nuclear power has convinced me that our schools do not produce enough qualified people to run our complex technological Society. We have a chronic shortage of trained professionals which is not limited to scientists and engineers but is all-pervasive. Nor do we have enough broadly and liberally educated people with qualities of leadership to administer the work of trained professionals. Because of these Shortages, our most competent people often are greatly overworked, which is not a good thing. Worse still, a less qualified man must often substitute. The result is either</p>
<p>unsatisfactory performance or costly delay. Our educational</p>
<p>system is simply not geared to the requirements of this scientific age. Much more education is needed today, not just by the future professional person and by leaders in government and in industry, but by everyone. All our children need education far superior to anything we in this country have ever had or have ever needed in the past. Only massive upgrading of the scholastic standards of our schools will guarantee the future freedom and prosperity of the Republic.</p>
<p>I began work on nuclear propulsion by setting out to find men of independent mind and venturesome spirit to make up my reactor group. From the start it was evident that no experienced men of this type were available. Before we could seriously tackle our work, we therefore had to find young people showing potentialities of growth whom we could then ourselves train intensively for work on reactor design. I have interviewed more than two thousand young men in the last twelve years, all top men in their college class. My naval reactor engineering group presently numbers about 150. Since the men who came to see me had already passed through a number of previous interviews where all but the best were eliminated, it is evident that those who could not meet the requirements of the nuclear power project-- and hence inferentially of any new development project--vastly outnumbered those who qualified.</p>
<p>This experience made a deep impression on me. It led me</p>
<p>directly to a study of why our educational system produces so</p>
<p>few men who are qualified to do the work which we must do if we are to progress. I found that our schools are the greatest &quot;cultural lag&quot; we have today.</p>
<p>When I read official publications put out by the men who run our educational system--booklets such as &quot; ife-Adjustment Education for Every Youth&quot; or &quot;Education for All Youth&quot; --I have a strange feeling of reading about another world, a world long since departed if it ever existed at all. I sense the kindly spirit, the desire to make every child happy, the earnest</p>
<p>determination to give advice on every problem any young person</p>
<p>might ever meet in life--and withal so complete a misunderstanding</p>
<p>of the real needs of young people in today's world that it frightens me. |</p>
<p>If I speak out against a mistaken concept of what twentieth century American education should be, I do so out of no desire to find fault with those who misread the demands of the times but from anxiety for the future of our children. I am worried about the chances which young people--who are so poorly equipped to deal with modern life--will have when things become more complex and difficult, as they surely will before very long. Today's big problems for young people are not how to choose the proper necktie, or how to be socially popular--these are minor problems which any mother can easily teach her children; which children can in fact pick up themselves as they associate with</p>
<p>It is quite Ineomprehensible to me why so much emphasis is put on teaching children to &quot;adjust&quot; to their &quot;peer&quot; group. A child's best learning time is short and should be put to better use. Let us help him to absorb real knowledge and not waste his time teaching him something that comes naturally to all children. Every parent knows that immature youngsters almost slavishly conform to the mores of their contemporaries. They</p>
<p>certainly need no courses in how to become little &quot;organization</p>
<p>men.&quot; The danger is rather that they may grow up without learning to think for themselves. Overstressing group adjustment may lead children to pick the wrong group and join a juvenile gang. Members of such gangs are probably the most perfectly group-adjusted youngsters you can find anywhere}</p>
<p>If education is to have any value it must help the youngster to reach maturity; to develop his reasoning power; and, through the discipline of rigorous study, to strengthen his character. No one can predict what problems he will meet in this uncertain and changeable life. The only way to prepare him so he can deal with whatever challenge life may bring is to make sure that when he graduates high school, he will be a truly &quot;educated&quot; young person. By that I do not mean the same thing as some of our educationists. Witness the statement of.a teachers college dean, : quoted in John Keat's revealing book &quot;Schools Without Scholars:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An educated man is one who is well adjusted and helpful in his</p>
<p>community.&quot; When the dean was asked &quot;whether a man who was well</p>
<p>adjusted and helpful could be considered educated without also being able to count his fingers or write his name,&quot; the dean said, &quot;Yes.&quot; __</p>
<p>Our schools have done a fine job making Americans out of youngsters with diverse backgrounds and doing this in record time. But this job is finished. The schools must now tackle a different job. They must concentrate on bringing the intellectual powers of each child to the highest possible level. Even the average child now needs almost as good an education as the average middle and upper-class child used to get in college preparatory schools. The talented child needs special schooling to move him rapidly through the period of absorbing knowledge into the period when his fine mind can turn this knowledge into new ideas, new discoveries, new ways of life. We need creative thinkers in the humanities no less than in the sciences, Living in crowded areas demands more of us in tolerance, in consideration, and in acceptance of necessary rules than life on the frontier. Perhaps our grandchildren will have to live with fewer material possessions. It is not too early to turn to inner resources, which are limitless: to art, music, literature, good conversation; to cultivation of a more contemplative way of life.</p>
<p>Other countries have successfully carried through the most drastic of educational reforms. So can we once we recognize the need. There is much we can learn from the advanced nations</p>
<p>of Europe which have always stood in the forefront of education.</p>
<p>By any pragmatic test, their education has proved its value. Crowded, resources-poor Europe still wields influence out of</p>
<p>all proportion to its relative size; it still has the highest living standard, excepting only that of North America. These are results of her remarkable intellectual achievements. I invite you to read the roster of Nobel prize winners in physics and chemistry; the number of original thinkers produced in the last hundred years; the number of basic inventions for present- | day technology; the discoveries in medicine which have made life happier and safer--in all these you will find Europeans outnumbering Americans several times over, measured in per onpiita performance,</p>
<p>At the other end of the human intellectual Scale, you wil] find that the leading nations of Europe started to wipe out illiteracy long before we did, and have lower illiteracy rates than we. Free compulsory elementary education was established in several European countries before we achieved this goal. It is today cheaper in time and money to become a professional person in many European countries than in America. The impressive figures on school attendance of American teenagers lose their impressiveness when we compare the time actually spent in classroom studies here and abroad--theirs being 1/4 to 1/3 longer each year than ours; hence our longer schooling is merely a sort of stretch-out. We have nothing scholastically comparabie</p>
<p>to the European academic secondary school which is either free</p>
<p>or charges small fees tailored to the income of parents. Our youngsters have to get this kind of liberal education in college, losing precious time and having to spend more money to boot--even in the state universities, where incidental and boarding expenses exceed the cost of the secondary day schools of Europe.</p>
<p>Many of our school problems spring from erroneous conceptions of democracy and equality; from our unwillingness to recognize the vast differences in mental endowment and determination which are to be found in any representative group of children. We must not make shibboleths of &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;equality.&quot; National ideals are not realized in a set way which remains unchanged forever. Democracy is a growing force. It never reaches perfection. It ever finds new objectives. To achieve it in a small, homogeneous farming community is one thing. Where land is abundant and a man's success depends primarily on his physical strength and courage, inequalities of mental endowment are not very important. To maintain democracy in a highly industrialized urban society is far more difficult, for here man must use his mind more, and hence mental inequalities become manifest. We cannot eliminate mental inequalities by running our schools in a way which hides them, as when we admit students regardless of their qualifications, or hand out diplomas and degrees to everyone irrespective of scholastic achievement. We</p>
<p>pride ourselves on being democratic when we thus eliminate</p>
<p>competition and reward from the most important activity a human being can engage in--brain work. But all we accomplish by protecting the lazy and stupid child and neglecting the talented is to impede technological progress.</p>
<p>This we could do with impunity so long as the choice was left to us whether to advance, stand still, or progress. Today we no longer have any choice at all. We are confronted with a country whose leaders have openly declared that &quot;they will bury us;&quot; a country that is larger and more populous than we; that possesses all the necessary minerals for a high level technology, many of which we must import; that is putting much greater effort and proportionately more money into producing well-trained scientists and engineers; and whose rate of industrial progress is greater than ours. In this situation, ability to progress technologically becomes an important element in relative military strength.</p>
<p>Our present situation is such that survival as a free and prosperous nation depends upon our being able to progress more rapidly. This we shall not be able to do unless we bring excellence into the schools; unless intellectual achievements are properly rewarded so that competition will again come into play. I doubt we can do this unless in some manner we set educational standards. The only practical way at present seems to be for American colleges to take on this responsibility.</p>
<p>They are in a position to pick and choose among applicants.</p>
<p>If they got together and agreed to keep increasing admissions requirements year by year, they would gradually force higher scholastic standards on our public schools. The private college occupies a strategic position today. It is engaged in the nation's most important activity--developing citizens who can maintain our complex civilization and push it forward. Unless we have such citizens and enough of them for our needs, our country is in danger. For in truth and quite literally, education is our first line of defense.</p>
<p>_ I should like to close with a well-lmown quotation from Whitehead with which you must all be familiar but which is so prophetically true that it cannot be repeated too often: &quot;The</p>
<p>rule is absolute, the race which does not value trained</p>
<p>intelligence is doomed. Not all your victories on land or at sea, can move back the finger of fate. Today we maintain ourselves. Tomorrow science will have moved forward yet another step, and there will be no appeal from the judgment which will</p>
<p>be pronounced on the uneducated.&quot;</p>
