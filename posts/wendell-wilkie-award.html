      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral Hyman Rickover&#x27;s speech, delivered upon receiving the Wendell L. Willkie Award, serves as a stark warning to the United States regarding its existential contest with the totalitarian bloc, primarily Soviet Russia and China. Rickover argues that American complacency, self-indulgence, and a misguided focus on personal comfort over vital public services like education and defense are jeopardizing national survival. He emphasizes Russia&#x27;s growing strength in resources, technology, and professional training, contrasting it with American vulnerabilities, especially in education, which he asserts is the nation&#x27;s &quot;first line of defense.&quot; Citing figures like Wendell Willkie, Barbara Ward, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Edith Hamilton, and Mao, Rickover critiques the American tendency to cling to outdated habits, dismiss unpleasant facts, and allow divisive interests and political patronage to undermine national strength. He passionately calls for a fundamental re-evaluation of priorities, urging citizens to embrace rational thought, rigorous education, merit-based leadership, and a collective willingness to sacrifice for the nation&#x27;s long-term security and freedom, ensuring the country is left &quot;better than he found it.&quot;</p>

        <p>SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1960 Remarks Prepared by Vice Admiral H. G. Rickover, U. S. Navy © for Delivery upon Acceptance of the Wendell L. Willkie Award Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana March 20, 1960</p>
<p>I thank you for the great honor you have bestowed upon me. It is an honor I appreciate most particularly since I am convinced, had he been spared us, Wendell Willkie would now be actively fighting for the things I myself consider vitally important. I am sure he would urge us to greater efforts in the contest with the Russians, just as I know he would be in the forefront in the fight to reform our school system. Remember, more than seventeen years ago he said: &quot;I think it can be stated as almost an historical truism that the greatest civilizations of history | havé been the best educated civilizations.'&quot;* And when he spoke of education, he meant ‘the edueation that makes men free. &quot;In fact,&quot; he said, “so important are the liberal arts for our future civilization that I feel that education in them should be as much . part of our war planning as the more obviously needed technical training. . . For we cannot win a true victory unless there exists in this country a large body of liberally educated citizens. This is a war for freedom—freedom here and freedom elsewhere.&quot; To him, freedom was &quot;of the mind.&quot;</p>
<p>It is particularly fitting that this award is made at his own school, Indiana University. I hope his example will serve as an inspiration to the student body : to help them understand that democracy is not merely a political and social device to insure that each citizen enjoys complete personal freedom bounded only by the rights of other citizens, but that democracy is far more than that: That it guarantees everyone freedom and opportunity to develop his mind and character so he may put them to use not only for himself but for the commnity as well, and so enable him to leave |</p>
<p>his country better than he found it.</p>
<p>Today the gravest problem facing the government and people of the United / States is the contest forced upon us by the totalitarian bloc, captitncd by Soviet Russia. The need to hold our own in the contest aggravates all our national problems. No final solutions are in sight. We must keep meeting the challenge for as far into the future as we can presently foresee. Nothing</p>
<p>we do to solve other problems will avail if we fail in this contest. The</p>
<p>Obviously we cannot take intelligent and resolute action to insure survival unless we first have a clear conception of what the contest is about. It is difficult to mister the necessary detachment and breadth of view for clarity of perception since the contest involves conflict between two diametrically</p>
<p>opposed types of society and we are personally identified with one of theme</p>
<p>rapes Bie Si</p>
<p>Nevertheless we must make the effort, each</p>
<p>h of us as best he cane Herewith is</p>
<p>my own attempt to do this. Parenthetically 1 will say that I am fully conscious</p>
<p>of lacking the qualifications, the resources, or the time to do the subject</p>
<p>justice. But, in so vital a matter, every citizen has a right and a duty to</p>
<p>express his opinions; out of a nation-wide discussion may evolve better under-</p>
<p>standing of the peril we face. That this peril is great, many of us still do not realize. This is</p>
<p>natural enough since nothing in our past has prepared us for the precarious</p>
<p>situation into which we have been placed by the determination of the totali- tarians to best us in all fields of human endeavor. Not since we won independence has any adversary seriously threatened our very survival. The enemies we fought in previous wars, though they may have seemed formidable at the time, were either greatly inferior to us in the true pases of national strength, that is in population, natural resources or technology; or they were mmabie, because of distance and transportation difficulties, to bring the full weight of their</p>
<p>power to bear upon us. There was never any real doubt we would eventually repel</p>
<p>their attack and preserve the Unione</p>
<p>In today's totalitarian adversary, we meet for the first time in our history a challenger who controls a larger ‘and area and more people and natural resources than wee While not now equal to us in the whole field of science and technology, Russia and her satellites have outstripped us in certain vitally important areas and are rapidly catching up with us in others; China moves ahead technologically with incredible speed. Modern nee moreover,</p>
<p>has wiped out the safety geographical distance gave us in the past. The oceans</p>
<p>are no longer our ramparts; the seas no longer protect uSe</p>
<p>This shift in fortune has been so rapid our thinking has not kept pace with it. We cling to habits of thought acquired when we were secure from foreign attack and could go about the pusiness of living, of taming the wilderness, and of shaping our national policies with little regard for their repercussions abroad. In the past we enjoyed a unique freedom of choice in managing our society; we came to take it for wentels pelieving it to be not a matter of luck but a result of our superiority as a nation and a people. We act as if this freedom of choice were still ours even though the geographical and political bases for it are disintegrating before our very eyes. The area</p>
<p>‘where we still have full freedom of choice between acceptable alternatives contracts each yeare</p>
<p>We no longer have a real choice between a policy of isolation or involvement in world affairs. It was based on our ability to count on a margin of time in case of war, while strong allies took the first brunt and held the line until we had built up armed forces and war industries; it was based also on our economic self-sufficiency; on the small part foreign trade played in our national economy.</p>
<p>Today we are vulnerable to foreign attack and there is no one. to hold the line while we get ready to fight. Simultaneously, heavy inroads have been made into the nation's once apparently inexhaustible capital in natural resources, some of it because of wasteful practices but most of it the inevitable result of rapid population growth and the voracious appetite of the machines that create our luxury standard of living. By mid-century we had changed from a large-scale exporter to a net importer of many essential raw materials. We now depend for</p>
<p>economic well-being and military strength on secure lines of supply from abroad};</p>
<p>imports must be paid for by exporting domestic goods, and this in turn affects</p>
<p>such purely domestic issues as inflation, the wage-price spiral, and other</p>
<p>factors that could price us out of world markets. The more we depend on</p>
<p>foreign trade the narrower becomes our choice of policies in economic matters. Where once we could disregard the effect of tariff and trade policies</p>
<p>on foreign countries, now we must take these effects into consideration, for</p>
<p>even small nations possess means to retaliate, chief among them the popular</p>
<p>game of playing the totalitarian powers against us. This change in our</p>
<p>situation is not fully understood by some influential power groups; their [| insistent demand that we disregard the needs and desires of foreign countries |/</p>
<p>in order to protect domestic industries not competitive in the world market runs counter to the interests of the nation as a whole. It springs from inability to grasp the gravity of the challenge posed by totalitarianism; every blunder we make in foreign relations is instantly exploited by them to win a point in the contest. Barbara Ward has said, &quot;No society can survive if everything changes but its institutions.&quot;’ These mst be kept flexible enough to function effec- tively even in times when change is continuous and rapid, as at present. &quot;Our tragedy,&quot; writes Miss Ward, &quot;our madness today is that our deepest in- stinets resist the innovations our reason tells us are the conditions of survival.&quot; Nowhere is this resistance to the need for changed viewpoints more evident than in the decisions we make on how much of our income must be invested in</p>
<p>public services essential to the internal and external strength of the nation;</p>
<p>how much reserved to private consumption for personal comfort and pleasure and</p>
<p>slates eam</p>
<p>for industrial prosperity. Here too we no longer have the full freedom of .</p>
<p>shofee that used to be an important feature of our way of life; yet many of ws cling to the illusion that it is part of democracy to starve the public sector of the economy and coddle the private sector, and that if we decided to</p>
<p>make the public sector stronger we would go counter to our political principles.</p>
<p>Arthur Schlesinger, Jr, calls this a &quot;weird and intolerable&quot; notion. He warns that we are doomed if we cling to the belief that production and consumption of consumer goods are the be~all and end-all of existence; that whatever does</p>
<p>not pay its way in the market ‘lace is not worth doing and that anyway. we cannot Me Sh leapwiger Can red , afford to do ite And so, the United States, &quot;the richest country in the history</p>
<p>of the world, can't tafford’ an educational system worthy of its children,</p>
<p>can't tafford! as many ICBM's as the less affluent Soviet Union, can't tafford' | a proper resources policy, can't even, heaven help us, tafford' a decent postal | system.&quot; Of course, we have the money; we simply choose to spend it on personal \ satisfactions rather than on public services.</p>
<p>Is it not time we re-examine our odd notion that money spent, let us say, on measures designed to insure our nation's sieved; or to give our</p>
<p>children an education that prepares them to live effectively and happily in</p>
<p>the complex world of tomorrow-~-that money spent for such purposes does not buy</p>
<p>anything of value to us personally while money spent on comic books or cigarettes</p>
<p>does? Surely this is a time when our private concerns are inextricably inter- twined with the larger concerns of the nation; chief among them the question of keeping ahead in the contest with totalitarianism.</p>
<p>There was a time--now long past--when we had a real choice between spending</p>
<p>money on public services or on private indulgences-~public services then were</p>
<p>not essential to our personal well-being and the future of the country. Today</p>
<p>*he choice is, in many instances, between taxing ourselves to support an</p>
<p>essential public undertaking or losing the contest to the Russians. It is that.</p>
<p>Was it sensible in the midst of a cold war to engage in protracted argu~ ments pro and con whether to build an H-bom, a missile, a satellite? As if this were a matter we could decide entirely on our own, when in reality we had no choice whatsoever for Russia was certainly going to build them. How can we | remain complacent while our leadtimes on important military items lengthen 1 while Russiats get shorter? We act as if it were purely a matter of choice | whether we continue in our present inefficient way or drastically improve our performance. Are we not taking frightful chances when we allow our dislike of government expansion to blind us to the necessity for government~financed f and directed development projects whenever such projects are too big or De uneconomical to be undertaken by private industry? Rather than judging each such case by its conformity to the existing pattern of our already-mixed economy, ought we not to decide on the sole basis of whether the project will so greatly strengthen the nation that 4t is folly to reject it?</p>
<p>Or take as another example where our freedom of choice has been lessened by the fact that we are in a contest with totalitarianism: education. Here boo we are reluctant to change traditional ways of thinking, centered on giving our children the most pleasant time at school rather than on helping them to develop into competent human pens able to manage their private lives success= fully, and to make a contribution to the nation as free democratic citizens. Whether we like it or Hist; education is our first line of defense and we neglect it at our peril. medueation,&quot; says the Ford Foundation's annual report for</p>
<p>1959, ‘tis now the indispensable medium for survival and progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Sessiats schools and universities outproduce us in highly qualified pro- ®eectomals and in masses of young people below the professional level who have = solid grounding in the humanities and sciences. Yet our professional saueat #jomists dismiss critics who urge that at the least we catch up with these Sussian achievements; they declare that Russia's educational performance is irrelevant since Russian children are educated to serve the state while ours grow up in freedom. But knowledge in the liberal arts constitutes genuine education--no matter for what purposes 4 child is given the chance to acquire it, while mere Life-adjustment training, no matter how kindly administered, will always be counterfeit education.</p>
<p>Gritics of American education value the genuine article as much for what it does to enrich the educated person's life as for its contribution to our nation's strength. Fortunately, the two do not conflict. Hasy frill courses may be fun but give no permanent satisfaction to the individual; real scholastic achievement satisfies on the personal level as much as it enriches the nation. But at the present moment, the importance to the nation of having a school system that really educates outweighs the pleasure that being well educated gives the individual.</p>
<p>Even were it possible to produce 4ncontrovertible proof that our children prefer to pass without strain and effort through Life-adjustment schools with automatic promotion and diplomas for all; even if it could be shown that parents and communities shared this preference, we ought nevertheless to disregard this preference for the simple reason that life-adjustment schooling does not</p>
<p>produce the kind of competence 4n our people upon which the future of the</p>
<p>nation now depends.</p>
<p>an all-out effort to keep ahead in the contest with Russia or allow her to</p>
<p>We are in such peril, it has pecome criminally irresponsible for any person u@ imfimence and standing to dismiss pleas for improving our public schools =ath such silly remarks as, The question of weapons research is by far not he omly or even the most important aspect of the question of how to preserve end extend the way of freedom.&quot; May I suggest that a missile that works, or a few dozen muciear submarines with Polaris missiles standing watch under the Polar icepack, would be quite an effective means for preserving and extending tthe way of freedom’; also that a genuinely educated people has 4 better chance</p>
<p>of meeting the totalitarian challenge than 4 pleasantly 14 fe-adjusted”™ one.</p>
<p>I am frightened by what appears to be a tendency in some quarters to prefer letting this country sink into second place, if the alternative means</p>
<p>uncongenial effort, goes counter te deep-seated convictions as to the proper</p>
<p>place of government in a democracy, or requires financial sacrifices that might slow somewhat the upward curve of private consumption. 1 am certain this attitude \ is the outgrowth of a sincere--though in my opinion tragically erroneous==</p>
<p>belief that we can, without grave damage to our country, choose petween making. Li</p>
<p>outdo us. Russia has only to outpace us in a single really vital area to put us decisively anto second place. Those who think 4t costs too much to keep our - nation at the top have never counted the cost of the alternative. Let us have no illusions on this score. Our choice is not between parity or superiority on</p>
<p>the one hand, and second piace on the cae At is between parity, 25 4 minimum,</p>

<p>side of ‘the “ron and bamboo” “Gartains. Most of us are aware of this but only, so</p>
<p>to speak, at the top of our heads; not in the marrow of our bones.</p>
<p>The central fact about the contest is that every action we take--no matter Sn whet sree of private or public life--affects our position 4n the race with Gussia. We have no choice but to accept this fact of international life today ==d come to terms with the grim present Other peoples have for centuries Lived wath constant peril--Christendom with Islam's ever-present threat to exterminate she infidel; the Byzantine Empire under perpetual siege by the parbarians who surrounded that citadel of civilization. In both cases the contest continued for 4 thousand years. We, too, can accustom ourselves to being subjected to outside pressures affecting national policy decisions. Indeed we must, for the time has gone forever when we &gt; had the unique good fortune to be allowed to g0 about the business of living, without giving thought to foreign danger; when the wealth of this continent made us independent of other mika oti. and distance from the centers of world conflict allowed us to shape our destiny in our own : good time without interference from abroad. Today, we are as 4nvolved in world events, as vulnerable to forces outside our control as are all other great nations e ——e There are various ways to characterize the two sides engaged in the contest. Our own inelination is to see them as Good battling Evil. This point of view has disadvantages « It is all 400 Likely to give us 4 false sense of security that may delay necessary actions We have deep-seated faith that in 4 wisely ordered universe it woud be inconceivable for Evil to win the ultimate victory History, of courses, teaches us there are limits to the effects of goodness oF wickedness upon 4 power struggle « A sense of right is indeed a source of great</p>
<p>strength and its absence one of weakness, but neither will decide a contest af</p>
<p>there is too large 4 disparity between the contestants.</p>
<p>Smother aifficulty caused by this viewpoint is that it makes unnecessarily “gerd sledding for those who could and would keep us informed of Russian achieve~ ments. To know your enemy is surely the prime requisite for meeting his challenge successfully- But whoever attempts to show the Russian threat in all 4ts grim ramifications suffers the onus of being considered a man of little faith nd, quite possibly, of treasonable admiration for totalitarianisme</p>
<p>Tf the facts are nevertheless made public, we are prone to consider them exaggerated, the reporter somewhat hysterical; we do not like to believe what +s unpleasant nor to accept facts showing a bad adversary to be more efficient than ourselves who are manifestly good. Especially so when he is depicted as being more efficient in some legitimate pursuit or when we cannot fully explain his success as 4 consequence of his absolutist form of government « It is always distasteful to measure oneself against 4 competitor whom one considers evile</p>
<p>And so we are easily persuaded by those who have 2 vested interest in letting things &amp;° on as they are and whose argument that we cannot learn from Russian achievements accords so well with our personal 4nclinations o But often these achievements are not specifically communistic or undemocratic put simply efficient. To recognize that totalitarians do some things better than we is to be realistic, not disloyal. Nor can the achievements be giibly dismissed by stressing how sweet is life here, how bitter under these efficient totali- tarians o We are not engaged in 4 popularity contest but in @ grim battle for survivale if Husster methods in particular — instances | produce P better results, we wore ao vel to adopt then! to our. purposes Presently they are doing petter</p>

<p>leerge-scale development projects that Lift them up the technological ladder - T+ my be mentioned here that the Russians for their part do not hesitate to sdopt Western 4deas and procedures when they fit into their plans, yet their official dogma concerning the contest is quite firmly based on presenting it as one between Good and Evil--only of course in reverse order from our own’</p>
<p>Let us divest ourselves of the jnclination to deprecate the seriousness of the totalitarian challenge or to consider it solely an terms of Evil attacking Good. Let us examine the following more specific explanations or definitions of the nature of the contest.</p>
<p>For cuuple, the view that we are dealing with but another incident in the age-old struggle of freedom versus unfreedom. History records many conflicts between societies of free citizens and societies of unfree subjects. We tend to think of the present contest as merely another in this long series of struggles&gt; We know that, beginning with the Reformation, the Renaissance, and the Age of Discovery a slow put steady growth of freedom set ino Once men had regained the right to think independently and to speak their thoughts they were pound to question absolutist regimes and try to make government responsive to the popular will. Following the French and American revolutions, respect for individual freedom and its inevitable corollary, acceptance of the principle that govermnents derive their legitimacy from the consent of the governed, spread throughout Europe, America and all parts of the world where Western ideas and institutions had taken roote This growth of freedom lasted some 400 years--so long that we now think of continuous growth as the normal, the natural thing, and of totalitarianism as a temporary relapse 4nto ancient errore We haven't paid enough attention to the</p>
<p>decline of freedom that began in {solated areas a5 early as fifty years agos</p>
<p>lL</p>
<p>world War II freedom's retreat has been Cee indeed catastrophic »</p>
<p>True, European colonialism has almost vanished, but against this must te rTecko oned the growth of Russia's colonial and satellite empire and China's secerminedly expansionist activities along her borderse Then too, colonial esencipation did not--as many hoped-—a.lways lead to advances in human freedom, +o greater respect for law or to via able democratic gnstitutions « Democracy proved too difficult for many newly emancipated nations and these nave returned to dictatorships under which there is today Less freedom than existed in colonial times « Worse still, where twenty years ago one-sixth of mankind was engulfed in totalitarianism, more than one-third live under totaLitarian rule todays Moreover , the balance of material power shifts relentlessly toward the totali-~ tarian side, not only 2s measured in Jand and people put also in political power o The main factor here has been the apparent ability of totalitarian rulers to</p>
<p>make better use than democratic governments of the potentialities for enhance~</p>
<p>ment of national power inherent in science and technology</p>
<p>Armed with technology, modern totalitarianism exerts today such over= whelming power over its subject peoples it is difficult to conceive the possibility of internal revolt and successful overthrow of government o Totali~ tarianism may turn out not to be a temporary lapse in mankind's march toward freedom; on the contrary» 4% may well be that, once lost, freedom can now never be regained by those who lost ite This is one reason why today’ s contest is more serious than similar struggles of the past.</p>
<p>Another reason is the intolerance for freedom anywhere in the world; this drives totalitarian rulers to extremes jin their desire to force their own political</p>
<p>system on unwilling foreign nations Absolute rulers of the past found it</p>
<p>j= gzficult than modern gotalitarians to live side py side with free peoples ee= compulsion to world conquest by @ country amply supplied with land and Sesources——25 is Russia--is difficult | for us to comprehend - It my spring</p>

<p>caught have no fear of revolt by anarmed civilians; the time has gone when plow-</p>
<p>shares could be turned into swords and tyrants defeated by mere courage Perhaps the 4ntoLlerance is part and parcel of communism’ S messianic nature; the fact that it resembles &amp; proselytizing creed rather than a sober political doctrine « Russia's rulers reiterate ad nauseum that communism must in the end prevail pecause-—S° they say--it is the only political system able to meet the exacting aemands of mankind in the present Age of Science « This assertion of political jnfallibility strikes us as 7 nothing put 4 Poses yet my in fact be quite sincere The most Likely explanation, jnowever, of the compulsion to impose communism on the rest of mankind is realization by potalitarian rulers that the world cannot forever remain half tree, half slave; iron curtains cannot for all eternity pide the 1ife of free peoples. from the eyes of ¢otalitarian subjects- That the aspect of freedom abroad creates some gissatisfaction among Russia's docile masses would seem to be in indicated by 2 recent announcement of the Communist Party Central Committee , ordering renewed efforts to propagandize Marxism in Russia and warning against popular apathy in matters of ideology wpeaceful coexistence mast not be permitted to weaken oF Jessen the jaeological struggle _ declares the Committee - Though gotalitarian subjects cannot overthrow their government by forces they weaken it when they become 400 dissatisfied. Hence</p>

<p>of late we have come to recognize that the contest also has much in common. ath past struggles when upc oming ambitious and tough parbarians tried to seize the wealth of rich and civilized nations; we pegin to see how mach we ourselves |</p>

<p>It is tragic that as &amp; people we lack a strong sense of history for it could i</p>
<p>have helped us to avoid the errors that in the past allowed parbarians to conquer civilized nations. As part of our desire to make school fun for our children we have allowed progressive educationists to neglect history- Is it rational, asks Edith Hamilton, at this stage of world pisterys to give up tthe study of how the Greeks and Romans prevailed magnificently ina parbaric world; the stays LOO, of how that triumph ended, how a slackness ana softness finally came over them to their ruin? in the end, more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security, a comfortable life, and they lost all--security and comfort and freedom.&quot; History never repeats itself exactly but there can be Little doubt the cards are stacked against 2 self-indulgent, ynder-edneated people, devoting their energies to pursuit of a good time , and Jacking clear-cut national purposes | when they are confronted by 2 purposeful, gisciplined, morally unfettered nation, ||! | concentrating on a natio onal goal of world ¢ conquest History gives many examples</p>

<p>fear war less than we is their realization that modern weapons technology the age-old dream of the ruthless conquerors \\</p>

<p>affords the possibility of realizing</p>

<p>We cannot discount the possibility Russia may come up with an ultimate</p>
<p>oom that, when launched out of a blue sky; will wipe out all resistance.</p>
<p>yer bare the means to build such 4 weapon in secret; their rulers have the</p>
<p>gower tO make an unprovoked attack. They are restrained neither by legal nor by moral principles , merely by consideration whether the risk of retaliation</p>
<p>would be acceptable. What we should consider @ totally unacceptable risk my well appear to them worth taking. it is well to keep in mind a public statement</p>
<p>made by China's Mao some time ago; it discloses a degree of barbarity inc ompre=</p>
<p>hensible to the mind of civilized mane</p>
<p>| China, ne said, did not fear atomic ware Te she won, any amount of loss of human life would obviously be justifiable; if she lost, she would at least have profited by emerging with 4 greatly diminished population, thus solving with one stroke her overpopulation problem and so become immeasurably stronger «</p>
<p>As mach as half her population appears to be expendable to Mao--more than 300</p>
<p>million human peings-</p>
<p>civilized nations-—whether they have democratic forms of government or</p>
<p>! not-—-are precluded by ethical principles from taking advantage of weapons superiority, either to start an unprovoked war without warning, or to use this superiority for political plackmail--not at any rate in this day and age oo) Democracies are of course even further restrained by the very nature of their uy contest between</p>
<p>political institutions « We have here an instance where in 4</p>
<p>Good and Evil, the former is handicapped in 4 power struggle. We and other</p>
<p>ea Gi is aa</p>
<p>civilized nations could not take advantage of superior striking powers the | /</p>
<p>totalitarians can and no doubt will. Our prief A-bomb, and even priefer</p>

<p>| Given this disparity in striking power-—which we cannot alter except by | i</p>

<p>xy; the occasion an address in 1930 to the graduating class of the Lenin</p>
<p>Gekool of Political Warfare:</p>
<p>Mar to the hilt between commnism and capitalism is inevitable. Today, of course, we are not strong enough to attacks Our time will come in 20 or 30 years [erat is, in 1950-60/ 2 To win we shall need the element of surprise: The bourgeois will have to be pat to sleep. ‘So we shall begin by launching the</p>
<p>most spectacular peace movement on record. There will be electrifying overtures /</p>

<p>and unheard of concessions. The capitalistic countries, stupid and decadent, will rejoice to cooperate jn their own destruction. They will leap at another chance to be friends. As goon as their guard is down, we shall smash them with our clenched fists Ph</p>
<p>What I have said so far 4Linstrates the motivations that make our adversary so formidable——the contest so perilous for us» But what is it that makes him vechnohogicaliy so efficient? We cannot explain everything by the totalitarian form of government 5 that ey lies the dangerous and wholly erroneous View that our democratic principles and institutions preclude us from matching Russian performance « Tt is all too easy to use democracy as an alibi for mediocre achievement } or to feel that merely by invoking the word Mdemocracy” we assure ‘ happy outcome of the contest. But ideals do not fulfill themselves. Democracy/ is not self-executorys 44 depends on how we as democratic citizens perform our / public duties Certainly nothing in our form of government prevents us from | having good schools or from managing weapons developments or space programs { |</p>

<p>has the advantage that 4% can point the way to greater efficiency on our part</p>
<p>within the limits of our democratic principles; 4% shows that not democracy i/ /</p>
<p>but the way we use it has. kepb ‘us from remaining ahead of Russia I [</p>
<p>A simile may help clarify our thinking on what exactly is tgemocratic™ in the way we manage our society and what is Neotalitarian&quot; in the way Russia manages hers. :</p>
<p>A totalitarian government my be compared with a truncheon made of solid wood; democracy can be compared with a fasceSe This, as you doubtless know, is a pundle of elm or birch rods tied together by 4 strap, with an ax head protruding at one end. It was the emblem of the majesty of the Roman state anda you will also find it engraved on our silver dime where it symbolizes the strength and resilience that comes from the free union of many separate entities. A fasces makes a better handle than a piece of solid wood because jt combines the resilience inherent in its many separate reeds with the strength that comes from their being securely tied together by 4 stout bond. If the bond is loose, the strength vanishes; 4f the bond is severed, the reeds fall into 4 disorderly pile of weak fragments.</p>
<p>What makes 2 totalitarian state strong is its monolithic gocial structure, the ruthless competition that selects able rulers, and the speed with which</p>
<p>action can be taken to enhance national power and to adjust national objectives</p>
<p>ng circumstances « Those who command such actions need not consider</p>
<p>s; need not take time to justify their decisions; 2 servile people under etirict discipline carries them out witho out demir Nor do the rulers share the s@erifices they demand of their subjects their own privileged life goes on weatever may happen to the living standards of the people. It is easy for &lt;hem to take whatever measures are needed to strengthen the nation; 4ndustries power dams universities, laboratories, opera coniaeretl can be ordered puilt and manned and their cost met simply bY keeping the people's standard of living at modest Levels</p>
<p>in contrast, W » what makes democracy strong is the enhancement freedom gives to the quality of a people and the marvels free men achieve when the bond that unites them 4s of their owm making« When free individuals are joined pogether _ by devotion to their country; when this devotion is stronger than their gndividuel or group anterests 3 when they are imbued with the enlightened self-interest we eall patriotism—thens just as the individual reeds tied firnly pogether in a fasces are stronger than &amp; solid piece of wes so are democracies stronger than authoritarian societies of roughly comparable size and population.</p>
<p>But when patriotism is not strong enough to set high national goals and to make them paramount to parochial interests; when public institutions lack popular support and the power to prevent individuals and groups of individuals from abusing their freedom by pursuing objectives that damage she nation's strength--then the centrifugal force of divisive interests mY sever the unifying pond and destroy the nation in an anarchic rree-for-all of competing interest groups « In &amp; democracy, © the price of freedom is eternal vigilance to make</p>
<p>certain the ideal § of a strong and viable nation remains at all times superior</p>
<p>[ne she demands of selfish groups for increased power, wealth or special</p>
<p>f goivilece- Self-government is not synonymous with anarchy, nor freedom with absence of those restraints agsential-—under any form of government-—to keep the nation strong enough to survive and prosper «</p>
<p>The Russian system pushes determined, hardworking, able men to the top.</p>
<p>Competition is fiercer than anything ever known in this country. Ordinary men make superhuman efforts to escape from the grey misery of mass existence There are but two ways to get to the top: through the Commanist Party or through education. In consequence the small group of men who rule, as well as the trained professionals w whose technical knowledge is at their service, are the country's most capable and ambitious mene They keep their top positions only so long as they demonstrate competence and capacity for extremely hard work. ~ Nowhere is 4 man's whole tenor of life so completely determined by his z , oceupational performance as in a modern totalitarian state. Whoever botches 1 | s job as politician or professional person, as administrater or production man, has no escape to private employment - Men will work hard and perforce become efficient when failure in 4 top-level job means &amp; steep drop in position and earning power From the highest to the lowest level, people get no more ) than what they are held to earn by their services</p>
<p>| Indeed, I know of no democratic country where 4 man's needs are given so</p>
<p>Little consideration as jn the Soviet Union, Marxist dogma. notwithstanding - Oddly enough, most democracies are closer today than Russia to realizing the principle &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs -™</p>
<p>| In theoretically classless Russia, material rewards and marks of honor are</p>
