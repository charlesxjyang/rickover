      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In his July 22, 1978 remarks at the launching of the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Bremerton (SSN698) in Groton, Connecticut, Senator Henry M. Jackson emphasized the critical need for a strong U.S. Navy in the face of evolving global challenges. He lauded Admiral Hyman Rickover as the &quot;guiding spirit&quot; of the nuclear navy and noted a personal connection to the Bremerton, as its keel bore his wife Helen&#x27;s initials. Jackson highlighted the alarming growth of Soviet naval power and its &quot;expansionist mood&quot; across Africa, Afghanistan, Yemen, and South Asia, contrasting this with the U.S. fleet&#x27;s significant reduction to half its 1970 size and an inadequate shipbuilding program. Citing historical figures like Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;speak softly and carry a big stick&quot; advice and Lord Robert Cecil, the Senator underscored the Navy&#x27;s vital role in safeguarding peace, ensuring freedom, maintaining sea lines of communication for Western economies, and supporting allies, concluding with a powerful quote from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.</p>

<p>r SACKSON / News</p>
<p>US. Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington &amp; (202) 224-9378</p>
<p>FOR RELEASE: PM Saturday, July 22, 1978</p>
<p>At the Launching of the Nuclear Powered Attack Submarine BREMERTON (SSN698)</p>
<p>Groton, Connecticut Saturday, July 22, 1978 11:00 A.M.</p>
<p>Two years and two months have passed since the Jackson family had the pleasure of joining in the keel-laying ceremonies for the U.S.S. BREMERTON. During that time, many things have changed on land and at sea. But one thing is unaltered: Hyman Rickover is still the guiding spirit of our nuclear navy! I am delighted to have my old friend Admiral Rickover here with us today as we welcome</p>
<p>his latest contribution to the fleet.</p>
<p>It is an honor to be in Groton once more to take part in the christening of the new BREMERTON. As you know, the Jacksons feel a special attachment to this ship. She bears not only a proud Navy</p>
<p>name, a proud name from the State of Washington, but also, upon her</p>
<p>q keel, the initials of my wife, Helen. You recall Teddy Roosevelt's famous advice in 1903: &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick.&quot; Did you know he was talking about</p>
<p>the need for a strong navy?</p>
<p>In that same speech he went on to advise the American Nation to</p>
<p>speak softly, &quot;and yet build and keep at a pitch of the highest</p>
<p>training, a thoroughly efficient navy.&quot;</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt was on the right track way back then. Deeds,</p>
<p>not words, are what really count.</p>
<p>As Lord Robert Cecil put it: '&quot;Vehemence of language falls dead and impotent upon minds penetrated with the conviction that the storm which is assailing them is nothing but words -- brave</p>
<p>words possibly, but still only words.&quot;</p>
<p>A strong, up-to-date Navy remains a fundamental requirement of</p>
<p>our national security.</p>
<p>Recent developments on the world scene emphasize this require-</p>
<p>ment:</p>
<p>* Soviet leaders are in an expansionist mood. They are on the political offensive. In past probings, the strategic inferiority of Soviet power and a restricted naval capacity has set definite limits to the extent of the risks that Moscow was willing to run. Today, with the strategic balance tilting in their favor and with their growing naval forces, the Soviet leaders are accepting a more extensive and dangerous range of risks in advancing their position. The growing Soviet boldness is evident in a policy of military adventure in Africa, coups in Afghanistan and Yemen, and provocative</p>
<p>moves in South Asia.</p>
<p>* The Western nations increasingly depend on foreign sources of</p>
<p>energy and raw materials. To a greater extent than ever before,</p>
<p>we rely on oil and other natural resources shipped across the oceans. Disruption of these flows would have an immediate and devastating</p>
<p>effect upon Western economies.</p>
<p>* As the Soviet conventional threat has grown in Europe, the</p>
<p>credibility of the NATO deterrent increasingly depends on our ability to keep the sea lines of communication open for massive, rapid</p>
<p>reinforcement of our allies in case of need.</p>
<p>* Long-standing American allies, including Japan, the Philippines and South Korea, look to a strong U.S. naval presence in the Western Pacific to support their independence. And we and the People's Republic of China share parallel interests in deterring Soviet</p>
<p>expansionism in the Pacific area.</p>
<p>* Meanwhile, we see a continued growth in Soviet naval power. The Soviet Union now possesses the world's largest Navy. A central feature of its mission is the interdiction of Western sea lines</p>
<p>of communication.</p>
<p>A large, flexible, two-ocean American navy is essential in the national interest. Yet, we are approaching the point where</p>
<p>our Navy is too small to perform vital missions.</p>
<p>Today our fleet is roughly one-half the size it was in 1970. Through block obsolescence substantial numbers of World War II- vintage ships have been only partially replaced by more capable, more sophisticated, and much more costly vessels. Administration</p>
<p>after administration has reduced our five-year ship-building</p>
<p>program to the point where, this year, the President requested</p>
<p>for the construction of only fifteen ships. This building</p>
<p>program falls far short of what we need for the years ahead.</p>
<p>The Congress has moved to authorize a fourth Nimitz-class carrier. This is the kind of determined signal the Soviets can understand. The 13-carrier force of our Navy is the foundation for our capability to support the NATO flanks, to maintain the freedom of the seas and the supply lines to our friends and allies in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific, and to protect and assure the sources and transportation of the free world's oil supplies into</p>
<p>the next century.</p>
<p>This ship we launch today is, inseparable from the skilled Naval personnel that will operate it. We must rigorously maintain the high standards of excellence in training and in operating that have</p>
<p>been the special distinction of the nuclear fleet.</p>
<p>The BREMERTON, and her sister nuclear ships, will sail the seas as a reminder that a sovereign America is determined to</p>
<p>safeguard the peace and to assure the future of freedom. As Henry Wadsworth Longfellow put it:</p>
<p>&quot;Sail forth into the sea, O ship!</p>
<p>Through wind and wave, right onward steer? Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State?</p>
<p>Sail on, O UNION, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears,</p>
<p>With all the hopes of future years,</p>
<p>Is hanging breathless on thy fate!&quot;</p>
