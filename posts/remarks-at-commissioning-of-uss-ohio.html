      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this address at the commissioning of the USS Ohio, Admiral H. G. Rickover highlights the vessel as the 137th U.S. nuclear-powered ship over 26 years, emphasizing its role in national defense. He candidly states the purpose of such a warship is &quot;to strike fear and terror in the hearts of the enemy,&quot; viewing the Ohio and its sister ships as tangible evidence of America&#x27;s readiness to defend its freedom, thereby lessening the chance of war. Rickover intertwines this military purpose with broader themes of American democracy, acknowledging the nation&#x27;s ongoing &quot;experiment&quot; into its third century and reflecting on the sacrifices made for independence, especially pertinent on Veteran&#x27;s Day. He concludes by stressing the heavy burdens of a strong defense, asserting that &quot;those who wish the blessings of liberty must accept the fatigue of supporting it.&quot;</p>

        <p>Vice president bush, secretary lehman, members of concress, representatives from the state of OHIO, representatives from the navy, the crew of the OHIO, and invited guests,</p>
<p>Tue USS OHIO 1s the 137th u. S$. Nuclear powered ship placed into the service of our country over a period of 26 years.. The con- missioning of another nuclear powered ship is no longer a unique event, but it does give US a moment to reflect on the purpose of this endeavor.</p>
<p>Our nation is now into its third century. By the standards of history it is still an experiment in democracy, today also being veteran's day, we are reminded that in our short national life, enough have been willing to fight and die to-realize and maintain the dream of independence and freedom, jhe debt we owe them is beyond measure,</p>
<p>Of all mankind, a major portion of which is still not free. The task is not easy. The burdens of a strong defense are heavy. But those who wish the blessings of liberty must accept the fatigue of supporting it.</p>
