      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H.G. Rickover&#x27;s 1959 speech details the crucial lessons from the Shippingport Atomic Power Station&#x27;s initial 1.5 years of operation, highlighting its role as a developmental plant, not merely a commercial one, having already produced 325 million kWh by May 15, 1959. Key themes include the pioneering shift from metallic to uranium oxide fuel technology and the development of specialized materials like zirconium alloy tubing. Rickover emphasizes the paramount importance of safety, detailing multi-barrier containment, continuous monitoring, and the release of fifteen safeguards reports, while asserting that safety standards should not be relaxed despite low observed radioactivity. The address also covers the importance of maintainability, the ongoing challenges with &quot;conventional&quot; equipment (leading to innovations like canned-rotor pumps), the necessity of extensive in-core instrumentation for &quot;advancing the reactor art,&quot; and the significant public dissemination of thousands of technical reports and handbooks. Rickover cautions against simplistic cost estimations by comparing it to the Wright Brothers&#x27; first flight, noting that the $120 million project (largely government-funded) aims to increase output from 60,000kW to 150,000kW, all within a unique &quot;government-private industry&quot; partnership model praised for its efficiency and democratic scrutiny.</p>

<p>‘Remarks prepared by VADM H. G. Rickover, USN for delivery at The American Public Power Association Convention Seattle, Washington May 28, 1959 Jonldbicbicineldeiceteleickieke</p>
<p>The purpose of the Shippingport project was stated in the contract between</p>
<p>| the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Duquesne Light Company as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;It is anticipated by the parties that the information to be gained by the construction and operation of the Pressurized Water Reactor will probably permit a major advance toward realization of civilian nuclear power and that such information is expected to lead to further technical advances in subsequent power reactors. It is recognized that this first full-scale nuclear power plant will be of a developmental nature and will be operated with the primary objective of gaining information and advancing reactor technology rather than with an</p>
<p>| objective of furnishing dependable power and main- taining a high load factor,&quot;</p>
<p>This point of view was also embodied by the Atomic Energy Commission in ; its announcement in 1954 of the selection of Duquesne as the operating utility</p>
<p>for the Shippingport plant:</p>
<p>&quot;It is not expected that this first plant will produce electric power at costs competitive with power from conventional fuels. The project has been undertaken in order to gain more design and techno- logical experience than could be obtained otherwise...&quot;</p>
<p>In wording those statements in 1954, we anticipated that the Shippingport reactor might operate for a considerable period of time as the nation's only large scale nuclear central station plant and that this would impose on us a</p>
<p>special responsibility to utilize Shippingport to advance the reactor art.</p>
<p>I will review some of the problems we have encountered at Shippingport, some of the lessons we have learned, and some of the developments we have made which benefit others. We have now operated the plant for a year and a half on the first charge of uranium and produced about 325 million kilowatt-hours of electricity as of May 15, 1959. The plant has operated at full power for over 4,000 hours; two full-power runs of 1,000 hours each and one of about 2,000 hours have been completed. In addition to accomplishing an extensive and varied test program, the plant has demonstrated ability to perform well both as a base load or a peak load station. In particular, it has demonstrated that it can be started up and shut down more rapidly and can accommodate more severe load transients than a coal-fired station. Operation of this first large nuclear power plant as a part of a utility network is in itself valuable experience</p>
<p>for the electric utility industry.</p>
<p>URANIUM OXIDE FUEL From a technical standpoint, the most important information we have gained</p>
<p>at Shippingport is knowledge concerning the behavior of the reactor fuel as more</p>
<p>and more of it is being consumed, Building a nuclear reactor core is an expensive business because of the absolute necessity of insuring that it has been well-built. In view of this high cost, it becomes important to make the core last a long time, that is, produce a lot of power before it must be replaced. But almost no actual experience exists on this subject. Whenever you hear people talk about how long their reactor will operate between refuelings you can take it for granted that they are either extrapolating meager data from small samples or that they are drawing premature conclusions from the Shippingport operation, into which have been factored various degrees of optimism,</p>
<p>Originally we planned to use a metallic uranium alloy as fuel in Shippingport. This was the only type of nuclear fuel material about which we had any significant amount of information. But we soon discovered that any metallic low enrichment fuel element was not likely to last very long at the temperature needed for power generation. We learned this only after we had made an extensive survey of the metallurgy of uranium and its alloys and had carried out many difficult irradiation experiments in test reactors under simulated operating conditions. I then had to make a difficult decision: whether to continue with the exploration of metallic fuel elements, hoping that we could develop something which would prove to be satisfactory within the time we had allowed ourselves for design and development; or, instead, to break off from that approach entirely and embark on the nearly unexplored path of non-metallic fuels, such as uranium oxide, It must be realized that the type of fuel used would determine the details of the entire core design. An oxide fuel element would result in a design quite different from a metallic one,</p>
<p>After discussing this problem in detail with the technical people on my staff</p>
<p>and at Bettis, I coneluded from the evidence available at that time that metallic fuel elements were inherently limited in the length of time they can operate, whereas this was not the case with oxide elements. Therefore, I decided we would develop uranium oxide as the fuel in order to achieve a reasonable fuel element life. The data we have since accumulated have tended to confirm this decision.</p>
<p>Very little was then known about uranium oxide, and we had to take the lead in building up a technology. This included basic scientific knowledge of the properties of the material and fabrication techniques for making it in Satisfactory form--all this while the core design was being firmed up. We had to learn how to change a naturally sticky powder into a free flowing material which could be compacted into high density sintered fuel pellets of precise dimensions; we had to develop techniques for compacting these pellets under a pressure of 125 tons per square inch--nearly twice the maximum pressure normally used in industrial practice. They then had to be sintered at a temperature of over 3000°F. The final product was precision ground to a dimensional tolerance of five ten-thousandths of an inch with the uranium density held within plus or minus one percent. These techniques finally produce satisfactory fuel pellets, and this type of fuel is now being used or planned for many of the major reactor | designs underway in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>The use of oxide fuel forced us to develop a method for manufacturing large quantitites of nearly perfect seamless tubing of zirconium alloy to contain the pellets. This was another major development, As a result of the work done for Shippingport, such tubing can now be bought commercially for use in other reactors or for non-nuclear applications such as occur in the chemical industry.</p>
<p>These are a few examples of the type of basic developments which were</p>
<p>necessary to design and build the Shippingport plant. Another way to evaluate</p>
<p>what can be learned from Shippingport is to consider the design requirements we originally established and re-examine them in the light of our operating</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>I frequently hear that I have been too conservative with regard to safety. But to my mind the over-riding consideration in designing and building any reactor must be safety. Therefore, the first requirement we set for Shippingport was that there be maximum assurance that radioactive fission products would not escape from the reactor, even under extreme casualty conditions. We provided three separate barriers around the fission products: the fuel element cladding, the primary system boundary, and the plant container. Each of these was pretested to insure its strength and integrity. The primary coolant is continuously monitored to detect any leakage or presence of radioactivity from the fuel elements. The plant container atmosphere is also monitored to detect any leakage from the all-welded primary system. In addition, extensive analyses and experiments were performed on every component and system to determine its effect on plant safety.</p>
<p>The design was reviewed in detail by my people as it developed, and I personally looked into and passed on every aspect involving safety. We realized that design assumptions, procedures, precautions and agreements _ for Shippingport were doubly significant because no experience existed and we were establishing precedents for the entire industry.</p>
<p>Next, a series of fifteen reports on various safeguards aspects of the plant was prepared and submitted to the Hazards Evaluation Branch of the Atomic Energy</p>
<p>Commission and to the statutory Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards. These</p>
<p>reports were then made public and you can buy them today from the Office of</p>
<p>Technical Services, U.S. Department of Commerce. We also required the Duquesne Light Company and Bettis to prepare detailed operating procedures, not only for normal operations but for casualty and emergency situations as well. We reviewed these one by one, and after several revisions, finally approved them. No operations are permitted which are not in accordance with detailed operating instructions which we approve in advance. These operating instructions constitute a stack of books several feet thick and these have become, in effect, a part of the safeguards report. We also require periodic drills on the casualty and emergency procedures,</p>
<p>To do these things you have to have more and better qualified supervisors, operators, and maintenance people. You cannot base operating costs and personnel requirements for a nuclear plant solely on conventional station practice. A nuclear station is not like a conventional station; radiation makes the all- important difference.</p>
<p>I cannot prove by our operating experience that each of these actions in | the interest of safety has been necessary. But I will state categorically that I feel just as strongly today as I ever did the burden of insuring public safety against radiation; I have seen nothing so far to indicate that safety requirements can be relaxed. I would advise anyone who becomes involved with radiation or radioactivity to recognize that the public is not &quot;becoming used to radioactivity,&quot; nor losing its apprehensions in this regard. If I were beginning the design of the Shippingport reactor today with what I now know, I would maintain the same high standards where safety is concerned.</p>
<p>We are taking this very same attitude in our naval program: the new designs</p>
<p>are as safe or safer than the old ones; the new crews are as carefully selected</p>
<p>and trained. Of course, we are always trying to replace safety devices with greater knowledge or with improved inherent safety characteristics. But we</p>
<p>have not lowered our standards one bit. My experience with the naval program merely reaffirms my conviction that safety cannot and must never be taken for</p>
<p>Another design requirement we set was that the plant must have maximum flexibility for maintenance and repair, and also for modifications that would permit us to exploit the developmental nature of the project. The inherently low radioactivity and chemical inertness of water made this possible at Shippingport, and we were willing to pay a price to achieve it. First, we designed the plant with four separate loops, each with its own pump, steam generator, and instrumentation. Then we required that any one of the four loops could be shut down and worked on while the plant continued to produce full power. To this end, we provided each loop with double isolation valves where it entered and left the reactor pressure vessel. In addition we provided separate radiation shielding around each loop, around the reactor vessel, and around the pressurizer and other reactor auxiliaries. We did all this in spite of the fact that our brief experience with the NAUTILUS, at the time this decision was made for Shippingport, gave no evidence that reactor plant maintenance would become a problem.</p>
<p>Re~evaluating that decision in the light of our experience to date, how does it look? I can answer unequivocally that we have found this maintainability to</p>
<p>be an important asset.</p>
<p>Now as to personnel: It is obvious that maintenance workers for nuclear</p>
<p>plants must not only be more competent and more highly trained than those at conventional stations, but there must also be a greater number of them because radiation limits the time any one worker can work on radioactive equipment. With the reactor shut down, radiation levels near the shielded reactor plant equipment of our pressurized water plants are low enough that from time to time a person can spend one or more hours in the vicinity without receiving a harmful amount of radiation. However, if a maintenance man has to work in direct contact with such equipment--for example, on a steam generator or a reactor coolant pump --and the job requires many hours to complete, then several men may have to be used. For critical skills, such as stainless steel welders or special instrument technicians, this can become a serious problem. The operator of any nuclear reactor plant must develop and have available a backlog of maintenance personnel trained in the key areas, He must furthermore devote considerable effort to planning maintenance Operations in such a way as to minimize exposure of personnel to radiation,</p>
<p>At Shippingport, because of the maintenance features designed into the plant, this has not so far been a serious problem. The radioactivity of the system is at present still low. However, we must assume that it will increase with time. This will make maintenance more difficult. Also, we must be ready to maintain the plant even should there be a number of fuel element failures which would increase plant radioactivity, We must assume further that standards of permissible radiation levels may continue to become more stringent as they have in the past. I have insisted that all of our reactor plants~-both naval and Shippingport--meet</p>
<p>not only all existing radiation Standards, but also have sufficient conservatism</p>
<p>to meet any further restrictions which might be imposed. I urge other reactor</p>
<p>designers to do the same.</p>
<p>A corollary lesson we have learned is that conventional equipment troubles have not been licked. With all the many years of development work that has been done on the so-called conventional items, that is the pumps, valves, steam generators, instruments and the like for the naval reactors program, you might expect that there would be few troubles with this equipment, and that extensive provision for maintenance would not be required. ‘This has not proved to be the case,</p>
<p>There are two major reasons for our equipment difficulties: first, despite more than fifty years of design and operating experience, adequate understanding is still lacking in regard to the fundamentals of moisture separation in steam drums, hydraulic system characteristics, boiler water chemistry, boiler gauge- glass design, fabrication of large steel forgings and castings, and many other basic phenomena on which our conventional equipment designs depend. As a result, even minor design changes often lead to unexpected major difficulties. Second, the Shippingport units are significantly larger than any previous equipment, and thus they presented formidable development problems,</p>
<p>Today, the situation is as follows: the Shippingport ptoeran has resulted in the development of large canned-rotor pumps with water-lubricated bearings, steam generators, valves, instruments, reactor control drive mechanisms, and other key items of equipment for pressurized water reactors, and experience in constructing such equipment has now been acquired by several commercial</p>
<p>manufacturers. But the problems are not solved; we have learned to expect</p>
<p>unanticipated difficulties in the non-nuclear aspects of this equipment, because the existing technology is largely empirical. We have had to study and modify steam generators, steam separators, pumps, and instruments and we have been dependent on the special maintenance provisions I have mentioned. I would urge anyone who hopes to maintain a reasonable load factor on a nuclear power plant to insure that provisions exist to permit both corrective and preventive maintenance to be readily done to the maximum extent practicable without interrupting the plant's power output.</p>
<p>I do not mean to imply by these statements that nuclear power is unreliable. Quite the contrary. But one can become so hypnotized with “inherent reliability of nuclear power,&quot; often cited, particularly by those who have operated only laboratory~type reactors that he fails to follow the good engineering practice of providing for reasonable maintenance. Where radioactivity is involved, this</p>
<p>could be a serious error.</p>
<p>The last major lesson I will discuss concerns the advancing of the reactor art. If you do not become spell-bound by unsubstantiated claims; if you recognize subsidies for what they are; if you realize that nuclear reactors now under design or construction will not produce electricity at a competitive price; then it follows that at this early stage advancing the art should be the primary objective of any power reactor now being considered. The lesson we have learned from Shippingport, as well as from our naval plants, is that merely operating a reactor does not guarantee that the art will be advanced or that useful knowledge will be developed. There have been reactors built, and some are being built now,</p>
<p>with almost no instrumentation beyond the minimum needed to operate them, and</p>
<p>with mo organized test program. They run, but all they prove is that if you</p>
<p>bring enough uranium together in one place it will go critical and generate heat. Little new knowledge is created, few technical reports are written, and eventually</p>
<p>the reactor is torn down and another reactor is built in its place--also with</p>
<p>few instruments.</p>
<p>We have found that it takes twenty technically-trained Duquesne people full-time to think through a test program for Shippingport, to write up test procedures, to analyze data, draw conclusions and write up the results. This is in addition to the people at the Bettis Laboratory and on my staff who go over the work carefully. It is a big job, and an important one. It also requires special and costly instrumentation, and the necessary design features must be incorporated into the reactor design from the start. There are special instruments for measuring pressure surges at various places in the system. Special radiation detectors measure the build-up of radioactivity in the system. Provisions for periodically removing sections of small piping installed for this purpose as a by-pass in the main reactor coolant system permits the deposited radioactivity on the system walls to be carefully analyzed in the laboratory, and the effects of flow rate, temperature and purification are studied.</p>
<p>The system which samples and monitors water from each natural uranium fuel cluster in the core has proved its worth. It has shown us that in spite of the extreme care taken to insure that only flawless fuel elements are installed in the reactor, one or two of the 100,000 fuel rods have apparently developed slight flaws. The Shippingport plant design was based on an assumption of 1000 flawed fuel rods, and provision for this contingency were made--as for example, an</p>
<p>all-closed coolant sampling and analysis system. By being able to monitor the</p>
<p>Glawed elements we have observed that the situation has not gotten worse; further,</p>
<p>@e cam remove the fuel element whenever we wish.</p>
<p>To date the radioactivity of the plant has remained low, lower than expected. The radioactivity released to the river has had no detectable effect on the radiation background in the vicinity and is only a few percent of that allowed under the Pennsylvania state waste disposal permit. ‘this permit sets limits which meet all recognized permissible radiation levels.</p>
<p>So there are two lessons from this: first, apparently no amount of care in design and fabrication can guarantee 4 perfect reactor core with no flaws. Second, with proper instrumentation and provisions for handling radioactivity, a small number of flaws can be tolerated in a plant of the Shippingport type.</p>
<p>To improve reactors, we must know what goes on inside the reactor core, and what limits its performance. We have wanted to do this from the beginning, and in fact we set as a design objective for our first reactor, the NAUTILUS prototype, that we wanted to be able to measure temperatures, water flow rates, and neutron intensities at various places inside the reactor core. But we were not able to develop instruments to do it at first, and I was urged by many of the scientists and designers to forget about it; that it was too difficult. I didn't forget about it, and today all of our naval land prototypes and the Shippingport reactor have extensive in-core and plant instrumentation, at hundreds of points, getting data obtainable no other way. Future reactor cores for Shippingport and all other reactor plants in the U.S. and elsewhere will benefit from the data obtained from</p>
<p>our present heavily-instrumented reactor cores.</p>
<p>Wieme @F the dewelopments which I have been describing would be of much use ‘on mites unless they were quickly and accurately reported and the reports made cui aweilable to a wide technical audience. I can assure you that this is imme dome. Many people do not realize how much information is actually available Somm oer programs, and that nearly all of it can be obtained from government eeurces. In addition, much of it is reprinted in the technical journals. Early im 1957, we established the following policy: first, all information on the Shippingport reactor was to be unclassified; second, all technology developed in the naval reactor program would be unclassified; only naval reactor design and military information would remain classified. I have always taken a personal interest in insuring that all of our technology is made availabe to the widest possible audience. In line with this policy decision of 1957, we reviewed all of the classified reactor reports issued by our program, and we released several thousand publications for dissemination to people working in other reactor programs.</p>
<p>In addition, we arranged for the Bettis and Knolls Atomic Power Laboratories to publish periodic unclassified reports covering all of the latest developments in pressurized water reactor technology. The latest of these was recently issued by Bettis and is devoted entirely to &quot;One Year of Operating Experience at Shipping~- port.” It contains a great deal of detailed technical information, and I commend it to your attention if you are interested. You can obtain it by writing to the Office of Technical Services, Department of Commerce, Washington 25, D. C., which also publishes our other unclassified reports.</p>
<p>We also encourage our contractors to report their work in government reports, or in professional journals, or as presentations before technical societies. All of these are also available to the public.</p>
<p>As a result of these actions, the naval reactors laboratories have published--~-</p>
<p>va enclassified and available to everyone--several hundred technical progress</p>
<p>meports; several hundred topical reports in the form of government publications; more than 2 thousand technical papers in professional journals or meetings; and several thousand technical memoranda, specifications, or drawings. { believe that in the reporting and dissemination of really useful technical reactor plant information, the Shippingport and naval reactors programs are second to none.</p>
<p>We are also getting out much information through a series of technical handbooks. They are comprehensive and detailed, and they are all unclassified except for one which contains classified naval reactor design information. These pooks cover the complete range of our technical experience. They are intended for the scientists and engineers who actually design reactors. They are thoroughly practical, they are up-to-date, and they have been written by the very people who design our plants.</p>
<p>The first one, “The Liquid Metals Handbook,&quot; came out in 1950. A revised edition came out in 1952, and then in 1955 we put out an entirely new pook devoted entirely to the metal sodium and its uses as @ liquid heat transfer medium. Also in 1955, we put out the definitive handbooks on zirconium and on peryllium. A bibliography of reactor computer codes, that is, reactor problems prepared for computation on large computers, was also issued that year. We then put out 4 design manual on reactor shielding, and 4 handbook on the special problems of corrosion and wear which are encountered in water-cooled reactors. Two volumes of our three volume reactor physics handbook have been published, totaling over a thousand pages; the third one we hope to have out within a year. Also scheduled for publication within a year are handbooks on hafniun, uranium dioxide,</p>

The Westinghouse Electric Corporation contribeted SS0OG00 om the construction of the reactor plant,</p>
<p>Many people hawe tried te estimete the &quot;cost of atomic power&quot; directly from these Shippineport costs.</p>
<p>However, I comsider estimetes of this sort to be meaningless. Trying to predict the eventual cost of commercisi atomic power by comparing the money spent on the developmental Shippimgport plant with the electricity produced there, is like the Wright borthers&quot; trying to predict commercial air-freight costs from the money spent and the distance flow by their first airplane at</p>
<p>Kitty Hawk.</p>
<p>Shippingport is not a routine commercial atomic power plant, although it is</p>
<p>the closest thing in the world to it. The British reactors at Calder Hall are sometimes referred to as commercial atomic power plants and used as a basis for atomic power cost estimates. But they are not primarily commercial atomic</p>
<p>power producers. Sir Christopher Hinton, Chairman of the British Central Electricity Generating Board, the man who directed the design and construction of the first British atomic energy installations including the reactors at Calder Hall, stated in an article in the March 1958 Scientific American:</p>
<p>Dianne nln mera cecal</p>
<p>&quot;Tt must be realized that Calder Hall was built essentially for the production of plutonium, and that electrical power is generated only as 2 by- product. It would therefore be unrealistic to attempt to estimate the cost of nuclear power by</p>
<p>a direct calculation of the cost of the electricity which is produced in the reactors there.”</p>
<p>We must not become so fascinated with watching or manipulating cost figures that we lose sight of the basic fact that atomic power development is a technical matter, that the rate at which it advances depends upon solving many difficult technical problems, and that we can best judge the state of the art by looking at</p>
<p>the technology which is being developed and at the problems which remain.</p>
<p>PLANS FOR THE FUTURE I will conclude with a brief discussion of our plans for the future. The heart of our developmental program at Shippingport concerns the nuclear reactor core itself. We have a very extensive program to develop new physics concepts which can lead to longer life, better utilization of natural uranium, more uniform power generation throughout the core volume, reduced number of control</p>
<p>rods, and the like. We have metallurgists and mechanical engineers exploring</p>
<p>simpler designs and cheaper fabricating methods. We deliberately made the</p>
<p>biggest reactor vessel we could for Shippingport in order to provide maximum flexibility for future reactor developments. This reactor vessel turned out to be none too big for the first reactor COres but now we believe we can get considerably more power from this same vessel with our second core.</p>
<p>specifically, we designed the first core for 60,000 kilowatts of electricity, but electrical generat ing capacity for 100,000 kilowatts was installed py Duquesne so that it would be possible to utilize all of the power which a future reactor core might produce.</p>
<p>Recently, 45 the result of our development program, we have learned that, with a new core, it may be possible to get as much as 150,000 kilowatts of electricity out of the same reactor vessel. This was learned after the Fiscal Year 1960 AEC budget was submitted to Congress. Because of the importance of this development .1 have asked the Atomic Energy Commission for additional funds to make the alterations necessary to increase the capacity of the plant. This will require some changes to the reactor plant which will be financed by the Atomic Energy Commission. It will also require the installation of additional electrical generating equipment at the station by the Duguesne Light Company at their expense. The Commission is currently discussing this with Duquesne. These changes will enable us to increase the output of Shippingport to 150,000</p>
<p>kilowatts for a small part of the original cost of the station.</p>
<p>THE METHOD OF OPERATION { would like to close with a word on how we carry out the Shippingport</p>
<p>program. A single phrase such as &quot;government&quot; or “private industry’ is not</p>
<p>adequate to describe our method of operation. We have built uP something unique</p>
<p>and new, and I believe this method of operation is in itself an important</p>
<p>development. We have worked out a system which combines the peculiar abilities and experience of industry, the utility industry, the Atomic Energy Commission, and the Congress. In addition, of course, we draw on our experience and capabilities in the Navy, and the Navy in turn benefits from the things we learn at Shippingport.</p>
<p>This arrangement combines centralized decision-making and responsibility-- which enables us to move just as fast as would be possible in a totalitarian state --but with private industrial ingenuity and with democratic processes; our work is under constant scrutiny by Congress which controls the expenditure of funds, and has final authority over the entire program.</p>
<p>In this regard, I want to pay tribute to the cooperative spirit displayed by Mr. Philip Fleger, Chairman of the Board of the Duquesne Light Company, in working out with us these new problems. We have both tried hard to make viable arrangements and procedures because we realize that we are establishing precedents which can have far-reaching effects and last a long time. I am grateful for the support I have received from the Atomic Energy Commission, and in particular from our Chairman, John A. McCone. As for myself, I am grateful for having had the opportunity to work in this partnership and to have contributed to this important project.</p>
<p>And without the constant understanding and confidence of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy we could not have accomplished this job. This Committee of which Senator Jackson has been a member from the very beginning, has consistently and fully supported us through the years. Ina real sense, the Shippingport</p>
<p>Station is a tribute to their wisdom. 5 oBIECTION TO PUBLICATION ON GROUNDS 29 OBIJECTYE</p>
