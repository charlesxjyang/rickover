      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Summary</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Admiral H. G. Rickover addresses the critical shortage of scientific and engineering manpower, advocating for immediate and long-range solutions. He proposes significantly increasing teacher salaries to attract top talent, establishing &quot;demonstration high schools&quot; with rigorous college preparatory curricula and extended school years, and emphasizing industry&#x27;s primary responsibility for training its own personnel rather than relying on government subsidies or &quot;raiding&quot; talent. Rickover details the extensive training programs within the Naval Reactors Branch as a model, showcasing their success in developing highly specialized personnel?from officers and engineers to draftsmen and craftsmen?through collaborations with institutions like MIT and the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology, and contractors such as Bettis and Electric Boat. He highlights the creation of comprehensive technical handbooks (e.g., Reactor Shielding Design Manual, Liquid Metals Handbook) and the rigorous, practical nature of the training, which has graduated 237 officers and enlisted men and required significant investment, such as $200,000 for Nautilus/Seawolf instruction books.</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then he said, “None.” -</p>
<p>Now, the answer is—school officials will put some teacher probably</p>
<p>in charge of the classes who have elected to take these courses, I thinle<br>it would be an extremely difficult question to try to get the degree</p>
<p>_ of qualification of these teachers to do the job. We could find out<br>_ how many are employed on temporary or emergency certificates, but<br>--we.don’t know that at the moment,</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. This is my concluding uestion. Could’<br>co]</p>
<p>‘you give us your suggestion as to how we could meet this problem<br>immediately ? ely</p>
<p>Dr. Carteton. That is a tough question. If I had that answer I<br>probably would have some offers for other jobs or forms of service</p>
<p>would not be in teaching. :</p>
<p>Frankly, I don’t think that there is any overnight or.very short-<br>range—months or a year, or even 2 years—answer the roblem. It</p>
<p>_ isa long-range problem. I think the best prospect for solid improve-</p>
<p>ment in science teaching is through improved solid support for educa-<br>tion across the board,</p>
<p>I don’t believe that we will get support for the idea that as of next.<br>September we might double the salaries offered science teachers as. |<br>opposed to others. Even if we did, I don’t think it would ouaranteo ie</p>
<p>automatically a great gain in the quality of instruction or the degree</p>
<p>- of motivation that teachers could provide. &quot;4<br>This is a long-range proposition. I think that you see it in school</p>
<p>systems where, over the years, through better local support, these</p>
<p>schools have been able to offer higher than average salaries, Over the</p>
<p>long haul they have obtained a better than average faculty.<br>. The quality of the program put on by these schools is reflected</p>
<p>through this improved support.</p>
<p>Representative Prics. Thank you very much. We appreciate very<br>much your testimony. i</p>
<p>The next witness will be Admiral Rickover.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF REAR ADM, H, G. RICKOVER, UNITED STATES NAVY,<br>CHIEF, NAVAL REACTORS BRANCH, DIVISION OF REACTOR DE-<br>VELOPMENT, UNITED STATES ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION</p>
<p>Representative Pricz. I think there is one question I would like to<br>ask you before you get started,<br>Do you feel that there is in fact a shortage of scientific and engi-</p>
<p>neering talent?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir, and I am talking from my personal<br>experience over a period of many years, not only in the atomic power<br>field, but also from many years of engineering experience in the Navy.</p>
<p>There is a considerable shortage of scientists and engineers, and the</p>
<p>grave problem which faces our country today is how to provide the ..</p>
<p>trained men and women to maintain the momentum of our rapidly<br>expanding technical civilization. .<br>epresentative Price. Is it to the point in your field where as yet<br>that it has adversely affected the atomic energy program ?<br>Admiral Ricxover. That is a hard question to answer, sir, because<br>one can approah the problem two ways: From the theoretical stand-<br>oint of w<br>imself to take care of his own problems,</p>
<p>at we ought to have, and then, again, what one can do-</p>
<p>pet</p>
<p>00 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND. ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>Many of these problems can be solved locally by those responsible if<br>they realize that they themselves must take effective action instead<br>of wringing their hands all of. the time and expecting others to do it<br>for them.</p>
<p>Representative Pricz. Admiral, would you care to proceed now?</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. May I ask a question there?</p>
<p>Admiral, in the construction of the Nautilus, is it not true that the<br>Westinghouse people had some 3,500 subcontractors ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. They had a large number and that in itself<br>constituted a considerable education in atomic energy for many sub-<br>contractors.</p>
<p>Representative VAN ZANvT. I am wondering, in your own experi-<br>ence now, did you encounter any deficit on the part of these Westing-<br>house people or their subcontractors as far as necessary engineering —<br>brains were concerned’? ye</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; we not only have encountered it, but<br>we still encounter it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, any man in charge of a project who feels fully<br>responsible for it must realize that an inherent part of his duties is to<br>train people from the very start of the project. Of course, if one is<br>assigned a project and is furnished all of the money he needs and<br>all of the trained people required, he might as well go fishing, because<br>there is then nothing left to do. There is nothing difficult about run-<br>ning a project if one is given everything he needs.</p>
<p>Training of people is an inherent part of a project. The education<br>of the contractors and their engineers, and of the subcontractors’ en-<br>gineers is an essential part of the job. If you look at it from that<br>standpoint, then you go at it yourself and solve your own problems.</p>
<p>The Naval Reactors Branch was faced from the beginning with two<br>alternatives in its procurement of technical personnel :</p>
<p>a) To lure them away from other nuclear programs; OF<br>b) Yo train its own personnel.</p>
<p>To lure people from other programs would not have enhanced the<br>Nation’s potential in this field. Therefore, it was decided to train per-<br>sonnel for this program in all of the necessary basic fields and<br>specialties.</p>
<p>Special lecture series and courses were arranged at each laboratory<br>and shipyard. Universities near each activity have been utilized for<br>pertinent academic training. Personnel of the Naval Reactors Branch<br>themselves have actively participated in the technical training of the<br>activities doing work for us. By means of these programs, many<br>hundreds of scientists, design engineers, plant operators, medical<br>officers, and maintenance personnel have been trained in nuclear<br>specialties. The training program is expanding to keep pace with the<br>increasing development and construction requirements.</p>
<p>I would prefer, if this is agreeable to you, sir, to address myself<br>to the specific case where a very large program such as the naval<br>program has been able to “make” its own people. I think this is some-<br>what different than the testimony you have been listening to.</p>
<p>T fully agree that there is a great shortage of scientists and engineers<br>in the United States; in fact, the only avocation I have permitted<br>myself over the past few years is to do what I could to help alleviate<br>this shortage. ee</p>
<p>7 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 101</p>
<p>‘»</p>
<p>6;</p>
<p>For example, in an address entitled “Engineering and Scientific</p>
<p>Uducation” which I delivered at the Thomas Alva Edison Foundation<br>last November 22, and which is made a part of this testimony as an<br>appendix (p. 469), I advanced the idea that industry should help<br>support our schools. That is all right for a long-range standpoint.<br>But one can solve a lot of his problems by going at it himself, and<br>not merely bewailing the horrible situation that exists. Instead of<br>wasting time in this way, he can do something constructive about it.<br>Mr, Price, I am sure that Mr. Van Zandt and you know the spirit<br>in which I am talking here.<br>With your permission, I would like to tell you a few of the things<br>that we have done.<br>Representative Price. Would you proceed with your prepared<br>statement ?<br>Admiral Rrexover. I would like it understood that any statements</p>
<p>that I make today in answer to questions your committee asks will</p>
<p>be my personal views and not necessarily those of the Atomic Energy</p>
<p>Commission or of the Navy Department. I am sure that you can</p>
<p>obtain the official views of the Atomic Energy Commission and the</p>
<p>Navy Department by asking for them. On this basis, and with your</p>
<p>permission, I will proceed.</p>
<p>j Ihave brought with me a number of documents. They contain spe-</p>
<p>| cific items which describe what has been done along the educational</p>
<p>and training lines by every contractor, shipyard and Navy yard in</p>
<p>the naval reactors program, how many people they have trained and</p>
<p>are training, how they go at it, and how many hours are used. You</p>
<p>can see this adds up to a considerable total of education and training</p>
<p>for our program.<br>In any technical field the man in charge must himself assume the</p>
<p>responsibility for training his own people and those of the contractors</p>
<p>r and subcontractors. There are very few engineers and scientists</p>
<p>; available for hire who have training or-experience in the design of</p>
<p>&#x27; nuclear powerplants. Experience with reactor studies or with the I</p>
<p>fh design of research reactors or plutonium production reactors is of only</p>
<p>i minor value to the designer of a nuclear powerplant. Therefore,</p>
<p>, since one cannot recruit experienced nuclear engineers he must train</p>
<p>‘ his own. aan</p>
<p>I decided from the very beginning to train the people in my own<br>organization and to arrange for the training of those in the con-<br>tractors’ organizations also . ,</p>
<p>‘ As personnel within the Naval Reactors Branch became trained<br>in nuclear engineering, they gave several series of technical lectures to<br>top management and engineering personnel of the first contractors<br>in the naval reactors program. The Bettis Laboratory, which the<br>Westinghouse Electric Corporation operates for the Atomic Energy<br>Commission, for example, employs many people whose sole purpose<br>is to train subcontractors to become qualified in the highly specialized<br>work we are doing. Many of the subcontractors have not previously<br>had to do work requiring so high a degree of engineering skill and<br>accuracy, and they have to be trained for it; they nevertheless con-<br>tinue to make many mistakes so that the training never ceases.</p>
<p>Sinilarly, the Electric Boat Co., being the first shipyard to acquire<br>competence in this field, has been used to train personnel of other<br>shipyards as they enter the field,</p>
<p>si es</p>
<p>102 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>We have also arranged for training of people in the Knolls Atomic<br>Power Laboratory, operated by the General Electric Co. for the<br>Atomic Energy Commission. At the present time we are doing the<br>same for Combustion Engineering, Inc., which was recently selected<br>as the third contractor for designing naval nuclear propulsion plants.<br>We have also trained a number of shipyards and Navy yards.</p>
<p>The first thing we did along this line was to arrange to have set up</p>
<p>for naval officers a special 12-month course of instruction in nuclear _</p>
<p>engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ‘These<br>ollicers were either graduates of the Naval Academy or were engineer-<br>ing graduates of civilian universities. All had received 3 years of<br>postgraduate work in engineering prior to being assigned to the.<br>nuclear engineering course at MIT. The special course at MIT was<br>started in 1949.</p>
<p>Later in 1949 I was instrumental in establishing the Oak Ridge<br>School of Reactor Technology for the purpose of giving advanced<br>nuclear training for members of my own organization, Atomic Energy<br>Commission contractors, governmental agencies, navy yards, and ship-<br>yards. We havea large number of people in the field of nuclear power<br>who have graduated from MIT and from the Oak Ridge School.<br>These schools were established to get into the hands of future reactor<br>designers information which existed at that time mostly in classified<br>form in the minds and notebooks of Manhattan project scientists and<br>engineers. Many of the senior technical personnel of the Naval<br>Reactors Branch and its contractors received their first nuclear engi-<br>neering education at one of these courses.</p>
<p>Three points can be noted from these programs:</p>
<p>(a) They create new nuclear engineers rather than attempting to<br>lure existing ones from other Government atomic energy programs,</p>
<p>(5) Most of the cost of this training is being borne by the companies<br>involved, and not by the Government.</p>
<p>(c) A very real sacrifice is made from the very beginning of each<br>project to divert a significant fraction of the senior scientists and<br>engineering personnel for long periods of time into training; first<br>learning, then teaching. |</p>
<p>On top of that, I require all of the young engineers who join my<br>organization, despite the many hours of overtime they put in, to take<br>night college courses. The various laboratories working on our pro-<br>gram also give a large number of courses to their own scientists and<br>engineers.</p>
<p>if you glance through these documents, you will see to what extent<br>this is being done.</p>
<p>Representative Price. We have a quorum call in the House.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I think that I can complete my statement in a<br>few minutes. The main aspect of these documents is that they contain<br>no generalities. You can see from the documents exactly what sort<br>of training we are giving: the number of people involved, the duration<br>of the courses, what contractors, shipyards, or navy yards are in-<br>volved, etc.</p>
<p>Representative Prroz. Let me ask you this question: if you were<br>faced with the responsibility of setting up your office today and going<br>into some new projects and you did not have the organization you have<br>had working with you for years, would you not be in quite a quandary</p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING. MANPOWER 103</p>
<p>as to where you were going to find the scientists and engineers you<br>would nee</p>
<p>Admiral Rrexover. No, sir; I would not be ina quandary. When<br>a qualified man is placed in charge of a worthwhile project, and one</p>
<p>which people consider important, he can attract two or three good</p>
<p>men to start off with: these in turn attract others. Then you start<br>intensive training. The selection and training of personnel is the<br>single most important part of a leadex’s job, and it is one which he can-<br>rot cdelewate, but must do it himself.</p>
<p>The situation you mentioned is exactly what I faced. When I<br>started off there was no one but myself.</p>
<p>Representative Prior. Do you have any idea as to where the nub of<br>this problem is of training and producing for the future more scientists<br>and engineers.</p>
<p>Adiniral Ricxover. Mr. Price, in the type of culture we have in the<br>United States today, you get the kind of people you pay for... Of<br>course, there are decliicated people in every profession, but not enough<br>to carry the profession along. If you would immediately double the<br>salaries of teachers, you would immediately start attracting better<br>people to the teaching profession.</p>
<p>I know many scientists and engineers who would rather teach than<br>work in industry. They are highly qualified to teach and would do so<br>provided they were given a salary which would enable them to main-<br>tain their families decently, in the same manner their friends in indus-<br>try do.</p>
<p>‘Unless we quickly remedy the present treatment of our teaching and —</p>
<p>scholarly resources we will inevitably have morally and intellectually<br>incompetent teaching staffs. Eventually the bright young man will<br>sacrifice his desire to teach in favor of an adequate standard of com-<br>fort, decency, and security for his family. The movement away from<br>teaching has actually begun, and it looks as though it will continue<br>at an increasingly rapid rate.</p>
<p>Unless you raise teachers’ salaries to comparable industrial salaries<br>you are going to remain in this quagmire. Increasing salaries is the<br>most important thing to do, and it should be done at once.</p>
<p>Another thing I would do is increase the length of the school year.<br>The Russians have school for about 10 months each year, and a 6-day<br>school week. With good teachers, proper teaching methods, and about<br>210 days of schooling per year, I am convinced that we could have the<br>majority of our children getting out of high school and able to enter<br>at Jeast the second and probably the third year of college.</p>
<p>This improvement in teaching and increase in length of the school<br>year is going to be extremely important from now on because of the<br>increase in our youthful population and the increasing shortage of<br>school facilities.</p>
<p>Another thing that I would do immediately is to set wp demonstra-<br>tion college preparatory high schools in about 20 or 25 centers in the<br>United States. I think that some of the foundations, such as the Ford<br>Foundation, and industry might be interested in this. These schools<br>would be started and run for a 5- or 6-year period; they would be<br>staffed by the foundations with suitable teachers who would be paid<br>salaries commensurate with those being paid in industry. No tuition<br>would be charged.</p>
<p>a<br>*</p>
<p>{04 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>The pupils selected for these schools would represent a cross section<br>of the community, and not only the bright ones. The school year<br>would consist of about 910 full days per year- :</p>
<p>These demonstration schools would serve as a living example of<br>what could be accomplished by good teachers, &amp; proper curriculum,<br>and an adequate school year.</p>
<p>T am convinced that great improvement in high-school education<br>could be effected in this way. 1 know that many children are being<br>held. back by inefficient schools, crowded. classrooms, and inadequate<br>teaching.</p>
<p>Representative Price. You feel for a science teacher at any level,<br>high school or any level, they have to keep abreast of matters of science<br>and probably through seminars and summer courses and so on. Is<br>that not the custom “n most school systems, that the teachers not only<br>in science, but almost any other subject, are required to take certain<br>summer courses ¢</p>
<p>Admiral RicKoOvER. Tt is generally left up to the teachers themselves.<br>The reason many of ihe teachers take the summer courses iS because it<br>enables them to get promotions in the schools. Ylowever, many ©<br>them do it on their own time and for self-improvement.</p>
<p>But what we need is a much higher level of ability in teaching than<br>is presently the case in many of our schools.</p>
<p>You see, the Russians have &amp; much simpler system. They decree<br>that only one-third of the high-school graduates will go to college—<br>those who are the best. ‘We don’t and can’t have any such decree in<br>the United States. So the boys and girls in Russia must study hard<br>to get into college, and therefore only the best ones enter.</p>
<p>Tn this connection, however, it 1s my opinion that in addition to<br>putting stress on better teachers, better curriculum, and a longer school</p>
<p>year, some careful thought should also be given to the necessity of<br>‘ystilling in the boys and girls, early in their school years, the vital<br>importance to their futures, 2S well as our country’s future, of the<br>necessity for each one of them to receive the best education he can<br>possibly obtain. We must see to it that every high-school boy and<br>girl who has the talent is encouraged to take ihe proper courses a”</p>
<p>‘work hard so that he will be qualified to go on to college. The ability<br>of our youth must not be permitted to waste away. Tt is up to us to</p>
<p>see that every student who has the ability to enter college does so. We</p>
<p>The Russians have created a definite incentive and inducement to<br>study hard in high school which does not, generally, exist in the<br>United States. Their objective is to achieve the scientific and engi-<br>neering leadership of the world.</p>
<p>We have known for several years that our scientific training has<br>been deteriorating, and have done little about it. The first step we<br>must take is to improve the technical and sejentific training of Our<br>young people. . :</p>
<p>T suggest that industry, at its own expense, lend its engineers for a<br>year’s teaching service In our schools—as an emergency measure to<br>offset the present critical shortage of teachers, especially in mathe-<br>“matics and science. T also suggest that a clearinghouse be set up to<br>receive and channel all contributions by industry to colleges and wni-</p>
<p>versitics, and that industry recognize the need to increase such contri-</p>
<p>simply cannot afford to waste potential talent.</p>

<p>butions substantially and consider this as part of the expense of</p>
<p>‘yunning the business, that the length of the school year be extended</p>
<p>from 180 to 210 days to bring it more in line with the school year<br>in Europe and Russia; that extraordinary pains be taken from now<br>on to seek out and cultivate our gifted children; that two different<br>kinds of high schools be set up, one having higher standards, to enable<br>our gifted youth to advance as rapidly as they are able to, unhampered<br>by the slower rate of the children whose abilities ie in other fields<br>than the academic.</p>
<p>Zepresentative Price. Admiral, this is rather embarrassing because<br>we would like to hear more at length from you. I wonder if you<br>could possibly come back this afternoon.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricwover. I could come back this afternon if it is con-<br>venient to you, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Price. Would you return, please, at 2 o&#x27;clock?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcmover. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>T want to show yousome of the things I have here. A hs</p>
<p>Representative Price. We would like to hear from you, but we have<br>a quorum call.</p>
<p>‘The committee will stand in recess until 2 o’clock this afternoon.</p>

<p>AFTERNOON SESSION</p>
<p>The committee reconvened at 2p. m., upon the expiration of the<br>recess.</p>
<p>Representative Price. The committee will be in order.</p>
<p>We will again hear from Admiral Rickover, head of the Naval<br>Reactors branch of the Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover, you had started to testify in the morning ses-<br>sion and so I know you are familiar with the subject the committee<br>jis exploring.</p>
<p>T am just wondering whether you would express yourself as to<br>what you would do about attempting to solve this problem of<br>shortage of scientific manpower. For instance, what would you do<br>smmediately, then possibly, what you might do on a long-range basis<br>to help to try to solve this problem. ,</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF REAR ADM. H. G. RICKOVER—Resumed</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. There are 9 or 3 things I would do immediately.<br>Just before adjournment I touched on the matter of demonstration<br>high schools. I would try to enlist the aid of a number of founda-<br>tions, such as the ford Foundation, and industry to set up about 20<br>or 23 demonstration high schools in various places in the United<br>States. These high schools would be, definitely, college preparatory<br>schools. They would be operated rivately by the foundations, ‘and<br>they would be set up for a period of about 5 or 6 years.</p>
<p>They would charge no tuition, but at the same time they would not<br>let the parents or the public authorities determine what the curricu-<br>lum would be or how the schools operated. Their standards would<br>be so good that there would be no necessity for outside interference.</p>
<p>They would pay their teachers at the going rate in industry because,<br>as L mentioned this morning, 1 know personally that there are many</p>
<p>106. SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>engineers and scientists in industry who would much prefer to teach<br>rather than to be in industry, provided they are given a decent salary,</p>
<p>‘one which would permit them to maintain their families properly. —</p>
<p>The type of building for these schools is unimportant; in fact, it</p>
<p>could be demonstrated that you could _use old buildings and that</p>
<p>teachers are far more important than buildings.</p>
<p>As I said, these schools would be operated on @ college preparatory<br>basis, with teachers’ helpers and with other educational aids. If we<br>ran these schools for 210 days a year instead of about 180, as Is pres-<br>ently the case, it is my firm belief and conviction that children, after</p>
<p>attending 4 years in schools of this type, would be ready to take either</p>
<p>the second or third year of work in college.</p>
<p>These schools would constitute a living example to the community<br>as to what could be done. This demonstration high-school program<br>is something which could be started immediately.</p>
<p>From a long-range standpoint, I think the quickest solution is to</p>
<p>considerably increase the salaries of teachers, perhaps to twice what.</p>
<p>they are now. It is true in every occupation that, even though there<br>are a good many dedicated people who work hard without regard to<br>salary—and there probably are more dedicated ones in the teaching<br>profession than anywhere else—by and large in an economy and in a<br>culture such as ours, the people who go into a given profession are<br>just about worth the salary they get. _ ;</p>
<p>Now, what sort of teachers we get will depend on what the com-<br>rounity thinks of education and what the community is willing to pay</p>
<p>for it. If the community thinks that education is one of its most ~</p>
<p>important functions, and if the parents consider that the traning: of<br>their children is more important than the clothes they wear or t<br>entertainment, we will get better schools and better teachers.</p>
<p>Therefore, L firmly believe that the immediate step which must be</p>
<p>taken is to increase amply the salaries of teachers. If we do this<br>and use some discrimination along with pay increases, we can also<br>weed out unsatisfactory teachers. ° © Poke ge?</p>
<p>T would make the teaching profession the most respected and hon-</p>
<p>orable one in our land and one into which people desired greatly to .<br>enter, and not one to be used as a temporary convenience, as 1s some-</p>
<p>times the case.</p>
<p>Tam sure that in almost any community in the United States if the<br>proper steps were taken to show the parents what the children are<br>missing by inadequate education, they would loyally support schools<br>to the necessary extent. Fe<br>: seprerenente Price. You have a question, then, of local responsi-</p>
<p>“Admiral Rroxover. I think that it should be more a matter of local<br>responsibility. I think ultimately if you have the Federal Govern~<br>ment taking over all of the education, then the Federal Government<br>starts controlling it. I think the Federal Government can help educa-<br>tion, but it would be best to have the major support come locally.</p>
<p>Representative Pricz, In what way do you think that the Federal<br>Government could participate in the training program ?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Rrcxover. I think the Federal Government could partici-<br>pate to this extent: It could designate some disciplines or subjects<br>which are considered to be very important from a national standpoint,<br>and which need enhanced attention. ee</p>

<p>Representative Price. The Atomic Energy Committee last year set</p>
<p>up this study group to study the impact-of atomic energy on the Na-<br>tion’s economy. ‘That, of course, helped to stimulate the interest in</p>
<p>. ‘participation of private industry 1n the atomic energy program.</p>
<p>What has been the impact of this new industrial participation pro-<br>* gram on the use of scientific and engineering manpower? of<br>Admiral Rrcxover. To a great extent the ‘companies getting. into</p>
<p>_ the game are trying to proselyte people from existing organizations. -<br>-[ think it is very foolish of them because some of the people they.</p>
<p>proselyte in this manner are not really the best people. They may</p>
<p>have reputations, but they are not really the people who can design:</p>
<p>reactors.</p>
<p>‘As I stated this morning, T think that ‘anyone who has charge ofa</p>

<p>108 SWORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>Representative Prion. They are utilizing all of the manpower that<br>they are geiting now ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovrr. Yes, sir. oe</p>
<p>Of course, you know that there is a great shortage of scientific and<br>engineering personnel. We can help alleviate this shortage by insti-<br>tuting the type of training where those who are responsible for pro-<br>grams make it a specific part of their jobs to train people.</p>
<p>There is another general thing that could be done and that is to<br>increase the efficiency of engineers. In some industrial organizations</p>
<p>they do not worry too much about the number of engineers they have<br>~ doing the job. Having more engineers on a job than is necessary tends _</p>
<p>to ruin them, because it is not good for any man to be engaged in work<br>which does not tax his brain.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we could increase the efficiency of the engineering<br>personnel in this country by about 40 percent by proper use of our</p>
<p>engineers, by not having them do things which engineers should not</p>
<p>do, and with other, lesser trained, people can do.</p>
<p>Another thing which can be done: I recently visited a large metal-</p>
<p>lurgical organization where the management was complaining about<br>their inability to hire metallurgists. As you know, last June only<br>some 500 were graduated in this country and in Canada. The manage-<br>ment could have taken local boys who work in the plant and given them<br>night courses in metallurgy, and in 2 to 8 years they would be able to<br>do a considerable part of the work usually done by a metallurgist. It</p>
<p>is not too dificult to run tests on metallurgical samples. Not enough</p>
<p>of this night training of high-school graduates is being done.</p>
<p>Representative Pricr. Could you give us an example of how you<br>train people who have degrees in engineering or science to perform<br>the functions that actually are technical in their makeup?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. I will pick one example at random from the<br>lists I have here, although it applies to a number of activities that I<br>am concerned with.</p>
<p>At the Electric Boat Co., for example, among other training they<br>have night courses for draftsmen and workmen. If these men complete<br>the course successfully the company pays the tuition. That is how<br>the company creates its own draftsmen and this is how they train<br>people to do engineering work.</p>
<p>In other words, their attitude is, “We have a job to do, and we will<br>do it ourselves, and not depend on someone else to do it for us.” This<br>example for Electric Boat is true of all the contractors in the naval<br>program. :</p>
<p>Representative Hinsuaw. I think that the program instituted by<br>Admiral Rickover in the Navy in connection with the submarine-type<br>reactors in particular, and the success in recruiting crews who were</p>
<p>competent, and we have reason to know they were highly competent,</p>
<p>has been outstanding. ‘ :<br>I think the gentleman and his group in the Navy are to be highly</p>
<p>‘congratulated.</p>
<p>-The work of that group in preparing training courses and in train-<br>ing men, I think, could probably form a basis. upon which similar</p>
<p>- training courses could be based throughout the United States.</p>
<p>T note that in the literature which has been furnished us there were<br>two types of courses of instruction; namely, the type given to enlisted</p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 109 ©</p>
<p>men who were well qualified for the job they were doing, but probably<br>_ did not have an extensive education, and then for another part of the<br>course it was for officer personnel and such other personnel as were<br>able to take this additional work.</p>
<p>{think it is an excellent system. ” .</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Wherever we {nd an enlisted man who has the<br>aptitude to do the same work as the officer, We put him into the same<br>school class as the officer, Our greatest loss in this program is enlisted<br>men becoming officers. ‘The proportion of enlisted men in our pro-<br>gram who have become officers js many times that in any other, part<br>of the Navy- Tn much of our training the officers and the enliste<br>men are in the same group.</p>
<p>{ don’t regret the large number of enlisted men who become officers<br>and are thus lost to our program, because ultimately this promotion<br>redounds to the penefit of the Navy and to the country.</p>
<p>{ would like to show you 1 or 2 instruction books used in naval nu-<br>clear power training, if LT may- This book is called Reactor Compart-<br>ment Auxiliary Valves, and can only be issued to members of the<br>military service because it contains defense information. Tt is one of<br>a series of more than 100 volumes which we have prepared for a sub-<br>marine nuclear propulsion plant. ;</p>
<p>T will show you some more of &amp; different series. Here is one of<br>another series of six volumes. Tt is called The Manual for Power</p>
<p>Plant and Supporting ‘Auxiliaries, and if you will glance through it<br>ou will see what an extensive volume itis.<br>And here is an Operator Training Guide. An examination in it<br>must be taken before 2 man is qualified as a reactor operator for a.<br>naval plant.</p>
<p>Representative Tirsuaw. This book, Admiral, is on yeactor com-<br>partment quxiliary valves. Does that include those special valves<br>that had to be designed especially in connection with reactors on<br>board submarines ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Yes. You can see what a tremendous amount<br>of work has gone into it.</p>
<p>Representative Tinsiraw. We remember your telling us some time<br>ago that these valves had to be asolutely perfect in their operation, ©<br>course, because none of the materials that passed through the valves<br>could be allowed to escape into the air of the submarine, otherwise<br>service aboard the submarine might be lethal.</p>
<p>Admiral RIcKOVER: That is correct, sir.</p>
<p>Representative Van ZANDT. Admiral, this training program that<br>you are speaking about now, does it involve the training of personnel<br>‘or the manning of these additional yards to give them the potential of<br>nuclear construction ?<br>i. ‘Admiral RicKOVER. Yes, sir. You will find outlined in these docu-</p>
<p>ments which I have given to you specific descriptions of the courses,</p>
<p>the number of people that have taken them, what school or university<br>they go to, how they get their training, and who pays for the courses.<br>T have tried to avoid generalities in. these documents 0 that you<br>~ ean see what can be done for a specific program such as the naval pro-<br>gram. 1 would highly commend to anyone else who has @ program</p>

<p>110 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>We have paid dearly for this in the time and attention it has re-<br>quired, and it has taken a lot of sweat to get these things done, but<br>it. has been very much worthwhile. :</p>
<p>Representative HinsuAw. That presents an idea, Admiral. Is it</p>
<p>possible for a young man, say, to jon up in the Navy and requestand</p>
<p>receive assignment to one of these projects?</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. No, sir, not at the time he enters the Navy, but<br>it is possible later on. About every 3 or 4 months we issue a request<br>for both officers and enlisted men to volunteer for the program. We<br>do this for submarine and for surface ship personnel. The officers’<br>records are very thoroughly screened and the best ones are interviewed<br>in Washington to see if they are satisfactory for the program. f</p>
<p>We are currently selecting officers to start training to operate the</p>
<p>nuclear-powered frigate and the aircraft carrier. We must get people<br>who are not only smart, but whom we think can become dedicated to<br>the job, because the consequences of getting the wrong kind of people<br>are too serious at this early stage of our program.</p>
<p>As far as the enlisted men for submarines are concerned, they are<br>selected by their commands. The commands select their best people;<br>they must already be qualified in submarines.</p>
<p>For surface ships we also try to get the best enlisted men for our<br>training program. :</p>
<p>‘We put the enlisted men through such stiff instruction that we have<br>high-school graduates who are able to pass college sophomore exam-<br>inations in physics at the end of about 3 months.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. Admiral, in the manning of these<br>yards, to give the Navy this nuclear potential that it must have in ship<br>construction, has it been necessary to raid any of your existing projects<br>for personnel ?</p>
<p>Admiral Ricoxover. No, sir. I do not permit anyone of our con-<br>tractors to raid any other of our contractors. That is one of the sine<br>~ quo nons. Ifa contractor gets into the naval reactors program he is<br>not allowed to hire scientists or engineers from any other organization</p>
<p>in our field. He must train his own people. Otherwise, he is not</p>
<p>contributing anything. ,</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanor. In other words, then, this training</p>
<p>program that has been put together is functioning to the extent that<br>it is furnishing adequate personnel as the yards expand to meet the<br>needs of the Navy.</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. Let me give you a couple of examples.</p>
<p>When we started out with the Electric Boat Co., they had about 10</p>
<p>engineers; now they have about 350, and these are not people that they<br>have obtained from other atomic activities. These are people that<br>have been trained by Electric Boat.</p>
<p>The Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. now has about<br>60 to 70 engineers in their nuclear program, and this does not include<br>draftsmen who have been and are being trained in this field, but not»<br>a single engineer was not trained at the company’s own instance, either<br>by sending them to Oak Ridge or to some other school, or else trained<br>at one of the laboratories employed in the naval program. Not a<br>single one of these engineers has been taken away from another atomic<br>activity. ue ‘</p>
<p>T want to make this point clear, because I consider that everybody in<br>the nuclear power field should do the same.</p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 111</p>
<p>Representative Hrystaw. Then at that rate, for those who hope to</p>
<p>have power reactors on a large scale, or to engage in the construction<br>of power reactors, they ought to be starting now to train their engi-<br>neers? :</p>
<p>Admiral Ricrover. Yes, sir. :</p>
<p>Representative Hixsuaw. Or to retrain them ?<br>Admiral Ricxover. Yes, sir; you will remember I have never come</p>
<p>~ to your committee and complained about not having enough engineers</p>
<p>and scientists in my program. :<br>Representative Hinsnaw. I can’t remember that any complaint has</p>
<p>ever been made by him on personnel. That is a kind of a remarkable</p>
<p>thing, Mr. Chairman. bon . ae<br>Representative Pricu. Yesterday the Commission testified, Admiral<br>Rickover, that it gets about 25 percent of its annual requirement for</p>
<p>- new blood in reactor technicians.’ .<br>Does that reflect itself in any way in the power reactor program, do»</p>
<p>you know ? :<br>Apmirat Ricxover. It doesn’t reflect itself in my program, sir. I<br>am not too familiar with what is going on in the other programs.<br>Representative Pricz. They say that they need about 2,000 new</p>
<p>reactor technicians a year, and these would be engineering or scientific</p>
<p>graduates and they require about 2,000 a year and they are able to<br>get only about 500 from all sources.</p>
<p>Apmirat Ricxover. Well, Mr. Price, what they are saying, and<br>it is true, is that there is a vast shortage of engineering and scientific<br>jolene in the United States. There are two ways of solving the<br>problem:</p>
<p>One is to take the long-range viewpoint and the other is to do some-<br>thing yourself right away.</p>
<p>Representative Price. And you have already discussed that and you<br>have given us your idea as to what you would do on the short-range<br>immediately.</p>
<p>I do not remember your views on what you would do on a long-<br>range basis.</p>
<p>Admiral Rickovrr. On the long-range basis, I would definitely try<br>to have two different kinds of high schools, one which is definitely a<br>college preparatory school such as nearly all were up to 1917 or 1918.<br>enter the college preparatory-type high schools. ;</p>
<p>Those who desire to go on to college should go to the tougher high<br>schools. The other schools would be for children whose parents went<br>them to learn trades. These schools could also teach tap dancing,<br>wallpaper hanging, and similar subjects.</p>
<p>I think that is a perfectly democratic procedure, as long as every-<br>one has an equal chance to enter either type school. Not everyone can<br>become a Congressman, either, you know; only a few people can.</p>
<p>Representative Price. One from each district. °</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. That is right.</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpt. This special school that you have in<br>mind, would it be in physics and chemistry ?</p>
<p>Admiral Rioxover. Yes, sir. I would let.a group of educators set<br>up the course with the idea of cutting out about 2 years of the com-<br>bined high school and college time. We must do so because, at the<br>rate our population is increasing, particularly the population .under</p>
<p>We should have examinations and permit only the better students to.</p>
<p>112 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>16 or 17, we are falling more behind all the time in our high school and —</p>
<p>college teachers and facilities.<br>Representative VAN ZaNvT. Would you make a part of every school</p>
<p>system of every community that thing, or would you centralize it in. ~</p>
<p>an area? \</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I would have it in about 95 different areas in the<br>United States. To do this right it would have to be set up with private<br>support initially, so I figure roughly that it would cost, over a 5- or 6-<br>year period, a total of about #250 million for 25 demonstration high<br>schools. I think that you could get support of this idea.</p>
<p>Another way to help improve our high schools is to have the Federal</p>
<p>Government step in and pay the differential in salary which is required</p>
<p>to attract and to retain teachers qualified to teach subjects such as</p>
<p>physics, mathematics, chemistry, and so on, for which there is presently<br>‘insufficient or inefficient training.</p>
<p>We have got to find some means of being able to do the equivalent<br>of what the Russians do with their authoritative system. They only<br>sermit one-third of their high school graduates to go tocollege. They<br>have tough exams and the kids have to work like hell to get into college.</p>
<p>In this country they don’t have.to work hard and the school year is<br>not long enough for present day needs. By setting up these demon-</p>
<p>. stration schools and showing the parents what can be done, I think they<br>will become strong advocates for improved high schools and. insist<br>ree all high schools in their community match the demonstration<br>schools. ea</p>
<p>Representative Van ZanvT. Admiral, why could you not set up such</p>
<p>a school on the campus of the Pennsylvania State University where _</p>
<p>they have the reactor, and let the Government go in there and build<br>the facilities?</p>
<p>Admiral Rroxover. You are talking about a high school now?</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. I am talking about this special type of<br>high school.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. I think the minute you have the Government<br>setting up this demonstration school you have Government control.<br>don’t think that is good. I believe that most of the financing can be<br>done by the communities themselves, and I think the most important<br>responsibility that parents have to their children is to educate them<br>adequately in accordance with today’s requirements.</p>
<p>I think that the reason parents do not fully realize that their chil-<br>dren are not being educated as well as they should or could be is because</p>
<p>they are surrounded by a mass of propaganda about good living, social .</p>
<p>‘life, and so on. The ability to o tain things easily is being stressed<br>more than the responsibilities which are inherent in being a member of<br>- a democratic community.</p>
<p>T don’t believe that it is the function of our schools to take over all<br>of the responsibilities of the home. T think the major function of the</p>
<p>school is to teach fundamentals. We cannot expect our overworked .</p>
<p>school system to relieve parents of all their responsibilities.</p>
<p>Representative VAN ZANvT. These 25 centers that you speak about,</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>what would their annual production in manpower be each year ?<br>Admiral Ricxover. They might eventually turn out. about 1,000</p>
<p>students a year per school. re ee<br>Representative Van Zanpr. Each,orthetotal?</p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 113.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I mean per school. The main object would be<br>to have a living example of what can be done. We can’t do it the way<br>the Russions do, and we can’t say, “If you don’t go to college you have<br>got to go into the Army.” We can’t co anything of the sort, and we<br>should not do it.</p>
<p>Representative Hivsuaw. I think perhaps the public is not well<br>enough informed today over the amount of technology that the child<br>of the future is going to have to learn, When you stop to think that.<br>electronics is assuming such a high importance in our lives, we know<br>that, but we do not realize how really important it is.</p>
<p>Then, of course, the nuclear energy as a source of energy and as a<br>source of experimental knowledge through the use of radioactive iso-<br>topes is another subject which we are only on the fringe of.</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. I would say this, Mr. Hinshaw, that I don’t<br>think the parents appreciate how much potential their children really<br>have to master all of this knowledge, and at a very youthful age.<br>don’t think that as a Nation we know the vast potential of the human<br>brain, and we make very little use of it. 1 know that we can do much<br>better.</p>
<p>We have been talking about high schools, but perhaps the grammar :</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>schools are even more important. We must start with the high<br>school’s first, because by the time the young men and women get to<br>college they are able to do some thinking and judging for themselves,<br>and are able to act with some degree of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>We should concentrate on the high schools now, but I think ulti-<br>mately it may be even more important to have our best teachers in the<br>grammar schools.</p>
<p>Representative Price. Admiral, just the mere setting up of the<br>training courses that you have, that in itself increased the demand for<br>college men trained with degrees in the various sciences. While the<br>courses that you have will train some of them in this field, that,<br>nevertheless, trains only the group of workmen who in the future<br>must be highly trained and technical.</p>
<p>Ti does not immediately answer the problem of getting this nucleus<br>of the engineers, and the degree men.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover. We took college graduates and trained them in<br>these specialties. In my opinion, the colleges should not attempt to<br>train specialists. The time that the young people spend in college<br>istoo short. ‘They should be taught basic principles and not a collec-<br>tion of facts which are obsolete even before the students graduate.</p>
<p>No matter what your job is, whether you want to build a missile or<br>an atomic reactor, or a motor, it is up to the technical organization<br>that employs the college graduates to train them in that specialty. We</p>
<p>have taken young college graduates into our program and trained</p>
<p>them in our specialties.</p>
<p>Representatives Pricr. The courses that you were talking about<br>did more than train just mechanical men?</p>
<p>‘Admiral Ricxover. We trained at all levels. And we trained from<br>operators of powerplants to ‘physicists and to metallurgists, in all<br>specialties. You will find that outlined in my statement.</p>
<p>Representative Price. You are adding to the pool of scientific and<br>technically trained people? — He 4 eee</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxover.: Took at it this way, Mr. Price: I think that<br>probably not more than 1 percent of all the scientists and engineers—</p>
<p>114° SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>and there are now about 2,000 in our program—vwere obtained from<br>other atomic activities. AJl of the remaining 99 percent had to be<br>trained by our organizations. We had to do it ourselves.</p>
<p>I would rather take a young college graduate who has only been</p>
<p>‘taught principles. I would much rather have a man of that. kind</p>
<p>than somebody who has been taught the details of how to run a pump<br>oramotor. lithe young men know principles, we can take them and<br>train them ourselves. Lam sorry I did not make that clear.</p>
<p>We not only train enlisted men and officers, but we train scientists<br>and engineers, too. We are training at all levels all of the time.</p>
<p>If you get a chance to look through these documents, you will see<br>that we have many schools going on right now—all of the time—in<br>various places.</p>
<p>Representative Price. The point I was getting at was whether or<br>not that was an increase of the manpower school, scientific and en-<br>gineering manpower pool, or whether those figures are already con-<br>sidered and they were found lacking.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricorover. I don’t think our program is increasing the</p>
<p>_ scientific manpower pool very much in actual numbers. The important</p>
<p>thing in science and engineering is not entirely in numbers; what is<br>important is the ability of the individuals who are in a given field.<br>‘We are definitely enhancing the ability of the people in the program<br>to do their jobs. We are also increasing their number to some extent.</p>
<p>_ Representative Van Zanpt. I would like to review this proposal<br>of yours as concerning the high-school boy. As I understand, you<br>would handpick the sharp boys in a high-school class and after setting<br>up these 25 centralized schools, you would send these sharp boys there;<br>is that right? EES</p>
<p>Admiral’ Rickover. Relative to these demonstration schools, I<br>wouldn’t go too far at the beginning, Mr. Van Zandt, because you<br>might get some public opinion against you. Today, when we set up<br>these two types of high schools it would be easy to say, “Well, we will<br>have city wide examinations, and those who come highest in the<br>examinations can go into the demonstration schools”.</p>
<p>But for these schools to get a good start and receive public accept-<br>ance I would take more of a representative group of students, because<br>my basic idea is to have all out high schools eventually reach the stand-<br>ard of the demonstration schools.</p>
<p>Ifthey started with being too highly selective, they would be accused<br>of being just for “eggheads”,</p>
<p>My object is to demonstrate that most students could be motivated<br>much better than they are now—that they can do far better than hey<br>are doing now. :</p>
<p>Representative Hinsuaw. In my part of the country we have two<br>kinds of high schools. One of them is a so-called technical high school,<br>which is really a manual training high school, for those who probably<br>are not inclined mentally so much as they might be.</p>
<p>Then the other school is for the balance of the people.</p>
<p>Thave always thought that the technical high schools, so-called, were<br>for the backward mentally, but capable manually.</p>
<p>Admiral Ricxovrr. They were for people who didn’t care to go on<br>to college. That is the Gary system which was started by Dr. Wirt,<br>I think, in 1907. But this system of having special high schools for</p>
<p>- teaching trades died out to a great extent after World War I. The</p>
<p>el</p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 115</p>
<p>high school changed its character from being purely a college prepara-<br>tory school and gradually became a combination of college prepara-<br>tory, trade school, and social institution. In this process the college<br>preparatory part of the curriculum necessarily sufiered, and this is<br>one of the main reasons for our present difliculty.</p>
<p>Representative Hrysnaw. I take it that you do not go in for pro-<br>gressive education.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. I don’t want to get into that argument, sir.<br>Iam only a naval officer.</p>
<p>Representative Price. Are there any further questions?</p>
<p>Representative Van Zanpr. Now, you have suggested that this pro-</p>
<p>‘gram should be financed by business, did you not?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. By business and foundations.</p>
<p>-- Representative Van Zanpts And cost approximately $250 million :</p>
<p>a year?</p>
<p>A driteal Ricxover. Not for a year, but for the 5- or 6-year<br>period necessary to carry through a thorough demonstration. My<br>idea would be to get them a good enough start that the communities<br>themselves would take over and carry on.</p>
<p>T also believe that business should assume a much greater respon-<br>sibility for financing education because, after all, they get all of<br>these young men and women who are now trained at public expense.</p>
<p>I think that they should consider it as a part of the expense of op-</p>
<p>erating a business. They have to pay to train their workmen to do<br>jobs; why shouldn’t they contribute to paying for the scientists and<br>engineers they get from our colleges?<br>Representative Price. Are there any further questions? :<br>Thank you very much, Admiral Rickover. The committee always<br>appreciates your very frank and open discussion of these subjects,<br>and it is the reason you have been most helpful to us in the past,<br>and I am sure that you have been here this afternoon.<br>Admiral Ricxover. I appreciate very much talking to your com-<br>mittee. I fully realize the problem your committee faces. Everybody<br>has en talking about this subject, but very little seems to be get-<br>ting done. :<br>Representative Prior. There is very little being done about it. ;<br>Admiral Ricxover. I think there has to be a lot of initiative by those —<br>who hire scientists and engineers, and not a lot of moaning that</p>
<p>‘nothing is getting done.</p>
<p>Representative Pricr. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Mr. Durwam. I am sorry that I was a little late in coming to this<br>meeting, but I was attending to action on the floor of the House. I<br>wanted to ask the admiral one thing: 3</p>
<p>Having had quite a bit of experience with the lack of scientific per-<br>sonnel, and also dealing with a lot of scientific problems, what is your<br>thought of going to a selective basis at this high-school level?</p>
<p>Admiral Rickover. Would you say thatagain,sir? =</p>
<p>Representative Duruam. Going to a selective basis on the high-</p>
<p>—- gchool level. In other words, taking the boys that have promise and</p>
<p>some ability and classifying them into different classifications, or</p>
<p>whatever you desire to call it, but at least putting the bright boys</p>
<p>with the bright boys.<br>Admiral Ricxover. I don’t think you have to go as far as that,</p>
<p>Mr, Durham. I believe all that is necessary is to make it possible</p>
<p>116. SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>for any child to advance as fast as his capabilities and promise per-<br>mit him; one reason this is not being done in the high schools is</p>
<p>- because it is an administrative problem where they simply don’t have</p>
<p>enough people in the high schools to do the paperwork of letting<br>people get ahead faster. : 2<br>I have personally found that to be true. If you merely made it<br>possible, any time a child, anywhere, was ready to go ahead, if you<br>permitted him to go ahead at that time, I think that that would satisfy<br>the proposition that you are raising. I definitely believe that gifted<br>prudent should not only be permitted but encouraged to advance<br>rapidly. ; :<br>Rapresentuttve Duriam. I realize the difficulty in the type of edu-</p>
<p>- cational system that we have at the grade level in a democracy. There</p>
<p>is some difficulty there, but it always appeared to me that we were los-<br>ing a lot in not bringing along’the bright boy.<br>Admiral Ricxover. If you start in segregating the bright ones by _<br>groups, I think that you may have undesirable social consequences.<br>I think it is good for the bright students to associate with all kinds of</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Representative Duruam. I do, too.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcxover. But I would let them go ahead faster. I think<br>that you could solve the problems, not to the extent that you might<br>want, perhaps, but I think that, even in balancing all of the factors,</p>
<p>you would achieve about 90 percent of what you want if we had a</p>
<p>mechanism where any child could advance at any time that his capa-<br>bilities permitted him—if he was not held back. We must seek out,<br>and cultivate our gifted children, for it is from their ranks that crea-<br>tive ideas will come.</p>
<p>It is during the formative years that the good and the bad mental<br>habits set in. Here are all these children, very much alive and inter-<br>ested, but they are not being pushed mentally by their teachers. They<br>just sit around and dawdle and develop bad habits because they are not<br>being challenged. :</p>
<p>All schooling should be more difficult than the student is capable of.<br>Tt should always be beyond the student, It should be a constant chal-<br>lenge and struggle. cect</p>
<p>I mentioned before you came in here’ that I though the grammar<br>schools were even more important than the high schools:</p>
<p>Representative Duruam. The boy that makes a C grade takes up as<br>much time and effort and money on the part of the teachers as the in-<br>dividual who has the ability to advance in science courses. Some of<br>them just do not have this. I realize the difficulty in our educational<br>system.</p>
<p>Admiral Rrcrover. It is my feeling that you would accomplish most<br>of your purpose by making it readily possible for any qualified child<br>to get ahead as fast and as soon as he was able to get ahead. In fact,<br>he should be encouraged to get ahead. There should be a constant<br>challengeforhim. ©.</p>
<p>I find in my own field that I have an awful time getting bad habits</p>
<p>out of people who have been subjected to the easy-going regime in the</p>
<p>schools, and in industry, too. If I were to advertise for scientists and<br>engineers I would advertise not for those who are looking for beauti-</p>
<p>ful surroundings and country clubs and with “no particular assign-</p>
<p>oe</p>
<p>,<br>SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 117</p>
<p>ment”—and these last three words I am quoting from one of the re-<br>cent newspaper ads—I would say “you will have to work like hell, you .<br>have to work many hours a week without getting paid overtime, and<br>you will have to go to school at night in addition.”</p>
<p>You can get a lot of good people that way. There are many people<br>in this country who would like it; there are more self-respecting people<br>than these who are looking for sinecures where they get paid for doing .<br>nothing but just associating with other smart people like themselves.</p>
<p>There are too many smart people, but not enough who work hard.</p>
<p>Representative Price. Thank you very much, Admiral. At this</p>
<p>point we will insert the material you referred to earlier.</p>

<p>J. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>There are very few engineers and scientists available for hire who have train-<br>ing or experience in the design of nuclear powerplants. Experience with reactor<br>studies or with the design of research reactors or plutonium production reactors<br>js only of minor value to the designer of a nuclear powerplant,</p>
<p>Therefore, since one cannot recruit experienced nuclear engineers. he must<br>train his own. These pages describe the steps taken by the Naval Reactors<br>Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission to accomplish this within the naval<br>reactors and pressurized water reactor (PWR: Shippingport, Pa.) programs.</p>
<p>The advanced nuclear engineering course for naval officers at the Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology (MIT) and later the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Tech-<br>nology were established during 1949 largely at the instigation of Admiral Rick-<br>‘over. to get into the hands of future reactor designers jnformation which existed<br>at that time mostly in classified form in the-minds and notebooks of Manhattan<br>-project scientists. Many. of the senior technical personnel of the Naval Reactors<br>Branch and its contractors received their first nuclear engineering education at<br>one of these courses. ;</p>
<p>As personnel within the Naval Reactors Branch became trained in nuclear<br>engineering, they gave several series of technical lectures to top management</p>
<p>and engineering personnel of the first prime contractors in the naval reactors pro-<br>gram. The Bettis Laboratory, which the Westinghouse Hlectric Corp., operates<br>for the Atomic Energy Commission, pecame the focal point for training personnel<br>of other organizations in nuclear engineering as they entered the water-cooled<br>naval reactor business. Similarly, the Electric Boat Division of. the General<br>Dynamics Corp., being the first shipyard to acquire competence in this field, was<br>used to train personnel of other shipyards as they entered the field.<br>In section II, part A, below, the programs are described which each of the naval<br>reactors contractors has undertaken to develop a core of trained nuclear engineers<br>and scientists. Part B summarizes the programs of the shipyards, private and<br>Navy, for training nuclear engineers and designers. Part © discusses the train-<br>ing of the personnel of the Naval Reactors Branch jtself and also lists the lecture<br>geries which they have given to various other organizations. Part D describes<br>the basic nuclear engineering education programs such as the naval nuclear<br>engineering courses at MIT, the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology, the<br>training of naval officers and men in operation and maintenance of naval nuclear<br>powerplants, and the training of medical officers and hospitalmen for duty with<br>nuclear powered vessels. Part © gives some examples of miscellaneous training<br>functions performed under the naval reactors program, such as the preparation<br>and publication of reactor design and technology manuals, preparation of in-<br>struction books for nuclear powerplants, etc.<br>Three points can be noted from these programs:<br>(a). They create nuclear engineers rather than attempting to. lure existing<br>ones from other Government atomic-energy programs.<br>(b) Most of the cost of this training is being borne by the companies involved.<br>and not by the Government. :<br>(c) .A-very. real sacrifice is made from the very beginning of each project to<br>divert a significant fraction of the senior scientists and engineering personnel for</p>
<p>long periods of time into training; first learning, then teaching.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>et</p>
<p>@ SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 119</p>
<p>The training programs fall into several categories: : :</p>
<p>(a) Formal nuclear training at central locations such as MIT and Oak Ridge. :</p>
<p>(b) Special training schools and lecture series-set up by each of the various<br>companies and shipyards in the program to cover broadly: the basic principles<br>of nuclear engineering for large groups of their technical personnel. These’<br>courses are given by the senior people in the Naval Reactors Branch, and later<br>by senior people from various contractors in the naval reactors program.</p>
<p>(c) Special ad hoc courses established to cover specific aspects of nuclear<br>design in detail; these include reactor design, radiation shielding, basie reactor<br>physies, statistic] design of experiments, ate, : : :</p>
<p>(@) Academie training In the basie technieal subjects (such as mathematies, :<br>physics, metallurgy, heat transfer) established with local universities and other...<br>educational facilities near each contractor. Special measures are taken by each -<br>organization to encourage such extracurricular training; for: example, -several. ©<br>of the contractors reimburse ‘all expenses of tuition and books upon successful<br>completion of technical courses. This philosophy has. been carried even to<br>draftsmen and technicians. ,</p>
<p>(e) Special technical books andy reports are being prepared and published to<br>implement the training lectures. These include nuclear design manuals and<br>handbooks covering various fields of nuclear powerplant technology, and detailed —<br>and comprehensive instruction books and powerplant manuals prepared.for each ‘ ; : if<br>new reactor plant to insure that the reasons behind the various design features eee he Sane at<br>of the plant are made clear to the plant operators and to the designers of future ms Ve ae<br>plants, 4 ee cos lll</p>
<p>(f) Since personnel enter this program with widely different specialized back- ult oa eo ae<br>grounds ranging from shipbuilding to mathematics, special efforts have been ; : Ben &quot;|<br>i made to acquaint these new people with the broader technical problems of nuclear<br>power. Trips to other facilities, exchange of personnel between organizations, .<br>q etc., have been arranged for this purpose. :</p>
<p>i Section III discusses briefly the recruiting, selection, and hiring practices<br>‘followed by the Naval Reactors Branch in obtaining potential nuclear engineers.<br>Section IV mentions steps being taken to minimize the demand within the naval<br>reactors program for nuclear engineers, by devising means to increase the use<br>of the more available skills where possible and thus to free nuclear engineers and<br>scientists for work for which their specialized training is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>9 II, TRAINING : .<br>A. Atomic Energy Commission contractors . &#x27; : eee</p>
<p>&#x27; This section contains a summary of the technical training programs which have<br>| been developed with the help of the Naval Reactors Branch at the Bettis plant<br>(operated by Westinghouse for the AEC), the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory</p>
<p>(operated by General Hlectric for the AEC), the Combustion Engineering Com- i A ;<br>-- pany, Nuclear Engineering Laboratory, and the Duquesne Light.Co. personnel -. ; as :</p>
<p>| associated with the pressurized water reactor program, : : oo<br>. In addition to general background courses and lectures, there are several<br>i courses aimed at various specifie groups and problems which are set up as the need \ 4<br>/ - arises, with the duratign, level, and number and type of personnel attending : A<br>1 being determined separately for each case. In many cases, personnel from sev- - oar ee. |<br>i _ eral organizations within the naval reactor program attend these courses. ; : :<br>- : All of the naval reactors contractors have made special arrangements with ; ; 3<br>i —: local universities to encourage continued academic education of their technical : ;<br>| : personnel. Of particular interest in this regard are the joint fellowship arrange- : ae 4<br>; ments which Bettis has made with the University of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Seah pod<br>Institute of Technology. : ee 4</p>
<p>With the exception of these joint fellowship programs, nearly all of the expenses<br>ii of the training programs have been borne by the companies themselves. For<br>4 example, when an organization sends a man to Bettis for on-the-job training, the oe odd<br>a -company pays his salary and other expenses during that period out of company eben es<br>funds, Reimbursement of tuition and other expenses incurred by technical per- eee eg<br>sonnel for outside courses is also made by the company and not.with Government oe Bos<br>funds. :</p>
<p>The special courses given by the contractors are not casual lectures, but are.<br>planned courses with heavy homework assignments and written examinations<br>and grades. . Most of them are given after working hours and on Saturdays.</p>

<p>a I, TRAINING<br>a B, Training at shipyards</p>
<p>‘ll<br>/ 1. Summary</p>
<p>i Wach of the shipyards getting into the nuclear business faces a training problem. °<br>[ The requirement varies from general background information for managemenst<br>and supervisory personnel, through detailed technical education needed for<br>designers, down to special training for draftsmen and various crafts. The<br>yards meet this need with the help of the Naval Reactors Branch in-many ways:<br>First, personnel are sent for pericds ranging from a few weeks to 2 year or<br>more to other organizations for nuclear courses or for on-the-job training.<br>{ hese include the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology, on-the-job training<br>a at the Bettis plant or at other shipyards more advanced in nuclear work, Sec- }<br>9 ond, the yards encourage in various ways men to take courses at nearby uni- |</p>
<p>a versities. In many cases, special nuclear courses are arranged with the uni-<br>i versities. Third, background lectures are given by personnel of the Naval<br>{ Reactors Branch and by personnel of the shipyard who have completed some<br>nuclear training. The Naval Reactors: Branch lectures are generally 20 or<br>more in number and are 11%4 to 2 hours apiece. These are given by senior. men<br>i in the organization and.are accompanied by slides, charts, and models or actual<br>pieces of equipment. Fourth, each of the yards has a need to train specific ©<br>7 crafts in fabrication of stainless steel, lead, hydrogenous shielding: materials,<br>i “ and other problems peculiar to nuclear power. In some: cases special courses. for<br>draftsmei or apprentices have also been established.<br>The cost of this training at private shipyards is essentially all borne by the<br>yard and is done largely after working hours, A summary of the courses follows.</p>

<p>D. Basic nuclear enginecring education program</p>
<p>1. Naval quelear engincering courses at Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br>(a) The Lo-nonth course.—Immediately after World War Il nearly all infor-</p>
<p>mation on reactor technology was classified and was to be found only at. the.</p>
<p>AC&#x27;s national laboratories at Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Chicago, Il. In the spring<br>of 1949 at the request of Adm. (then Capt.) H. G. Rickover, the Massachusetts</p>
<p>Institute of Technology agreed to initiate a special curriculum in nuclear engi-</p>
<p>neering for selected naval officer students. Those students had previously re-<br>ceived a Massachusetts Institute of Technology degree in Naval Architecture<br>and Marine Pngineering, and then after some field experience, were sent back<br>to the institute for the nuclear course. At that time (1949) the institute did not</p>
<p>. offer a regular curriculum in nuiciear engineering, 80 this special Navy sroup<br>took courses, mostly in the phy ies department, leading to: the degree of master</p>
<p>of science in physics. This arrangement Was earried out for 2 officers in the<br>1949-50 academic year, 4 officers in 1950-51, and 4 officers in 1951-52, with minor<br>modifications in curriculum each year. ,</p>
<p>In the fall of 1951 Admiral Rickover asked the Massachusetts Institute of<br>Technology to investigate the possibilities of future modifications to this cur-<br>piculum aimed entirely at establishing the eurriculum as an engineering one<br>yather than as &amp; science curriculum. Tne institute took the position that it had<br>become clear to them, pa rtly through the requests of Admiral Rickover and partly<br>through their experiences at the Brookhaven and Oak Ridge National Lab-<br>oratories that the time was ripe for the establishment of nuclear engineering as<br>a separate engineering field of its own. The institute, therefore, established in<br>1952 a regular nuclear engineering curriculum under the guidance of Dr. Manson<br>Benedict. The source of naval students for this course Was expanded to include<br>officers with previous postgraduate training in mechanical and electrical engi-<br>neering as well as marine engineering.</p>
<p>The advanced nuclear engineering course for engineering duty naval officers is<br>normally fifteen months long and leads to the degree of master of science in<br>nuclear e<br>in 1952-53, 4 in 1953-54, 5 in 1954-55, and 6 are currently enrolled. Thus. &amp;<br>total of 29 officers have this far been sent to the Massachusetts Institute of<br>Technology for advanced training in nuclear engineering. : ‘</p>

<p>(b) The 8-year course—In 1054 a nuclear engineering specialty was added<br>to the 4 already existing specialties in the 3 year naval. construction. and * a<br>engineering course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Officers se- eed ;<br>lected for this course need have no previous postgraduate training. The pur- : vee</p>
<p>- pose of this specialty is the same as that of the advanced nuclear engineering |<br>course; that is, to train enginecring’ personnel for design, development, con- |<br>struction, and maintenance billets in the naval nuclear propulsion field. The<br>curriculum of the nuctear specialty of the three year course is a combination. |<br>of the nuclear engineering subjects of the advanced nuclear engineering course<br>(15 months), and the naval architecture and marine engineering subjects com-<br>mon to all 5 specialties. Graduates of the naval construction and engineering : eed oe<br>course Yeceive the degree of naval engineer. There are 4 officers currently ms : ee ee rae<br>enrolled in the nuclear specialty who entered the Institute in the summer of : poues a<br>1954 and 4 who entered in 1955.

<p>2. Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology (ORSORT)</p>
<p>In 1949. Admiral (then Captain) H. G. Rickover arranged with the Atomic. -</p>
<p>Jmnergy Conmission to establish the Oak Ridge School. of Reactor Technology<br>to give a i-year formal classified program jn nuclear ‘science and. engineering,<br>including laboratory work. The first pilot clags started in early 1950 with</p>
<p>about 20 students. Attendance hag increased steadily to the present level of 120</p>
<p>students, Close Haison has been maintained with the school by the Naval<br>Reactors Branch, since Admiral Riekover has been on the school board since</p>
<p>ita inception, Thirty-four aclontista and engineers bave completed the eourse</p>
<p>under the sponsorship ot the Naval Reactors Branch and another 29 from. the -”<br>Bureau of Ships and its naval shipyards. Another approximately 60 engineers</p>
<p>have been sent from the naval and reactors contractors.<br>ach year the students from the Naval Reactors Branch completing the Oak<br>Ridge course are asked to write up their thoughts on how the school could be<br>improved and these suggestions are- incorporated where appropriate into the<br>next year’s program. Topics for the summer theses are suggested by Naval<br>Reactors Branch personnel and the development of these projects is followed by<br>Naval Reactors Branch personnel in Washington. ‘</p>
<p>Recently by special arrangement technical military personnel in the Naval<br>Reactors Branch have been allowed to attend the course on &amp;@ 6-month basis,<br>omitting the summer project to go directly to work in the naval. reactors<br>program.</p>
<p>8. Operator&#x27;s Training</p>
<p>Training naval personnel to operate’ and maintain a nuclear powerplant at<br>sea is another major educational task. In February 1951, a group of 2 officers<br>and 10 enlisted men scheduled to become the nucleus of the Nautilus engineer<br>erew commenced a 10-month training course at the Bettis plant in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Although the personnel were of widely varying packgrounds, it was the ob-<br>jective of the course to turn out men who understood principles not merely<br>detailed operating instructions. Pngineering courses were therefore on &amp; par</p>
<p>with comparable college offerings. Instruction was given. by Westinghouse :</p>

<p>This training course was later moved to the N autilus prototype site at Idaho -</p>
<p>and finally to the submarine base at New London, Conn., where it ig still taught<br>along the lines of the original Bettis course. The curriculum is attached to<br>the original copies of this testimony 2s appendix 1. ;</p>
<p>A similar program was established at the Seawolf prototype at Schenectady,<br>N. ¥. This program was also later integrated into the New London school.</p>
<p>Jo date the naval training program has graduated a total of 237 officers and<br>men who have not only received training in the details of one reactor but also<br>a college level jntroduction to the principles of nuclear reactors and their control.<br>This represents a significant pool of power reactor experience and background,</p>
<p>Tt is interesting to note that when the Navy this spring advanced 200 of its<br>600,000 enlisted men to officer rank, 17 of them were from the 215 graduates<br>of the naval nuclear power training course. Since its inception, 34 enlisted<br>graduates of the naval nuclear course have been made officers. (An outline<br>of the qualification procedure for chief operator is appended to this document<br>as an indication of the extent of this operational training.)</p>
<p>4. Training for medical officers and hospitalmen</p>
<p>(a) Medical officers:—Naval Medical Corps officers have peen trained for the<br>nuclear power, program py adapting a course developed originally for the Armed<br>Forces special weapons program. This course includes the following:</p>

<p>2. Instruction books for naval nuclear powerplants.</p>
<p>Comprehensive and detailed instruction books for all naval nuclear power-<br>plants and for the pressurized water reactor were considered to be necessary — CE hdd<br>as a means for training operating personnel in the field of nuclear powerplant - : : se fafa | ee<br>operation and maintenance. Hach new plant (including prototypes) requires an : as ne Via<br>entirely new set of instruction books. ‘hese books contain specially made ex- ae ; cae fa<br>ploded or cutaway drawings and photographs and a great many flow diagrams, - : ie ae uae<br>charts, wiring, drawings, ete. : ‘ BRS sO els Su ve aie</p>
<p>Since each set of books represents many thousands of man-hours of effort, ; ‘ oe ee A I<br>i several attempts were made by the Naval Reactors Branch to minimize the time ; :<br>‘ of senior scientific and engineering personnel required in their preparation. ‘The<br>: s books were contracted to two different professional technical writing firms in<br>|</p>
<p>succession, but neither of these companies was able to produce a satisfactory</p>
<p>book, even with very close followup. forts to utilize mostly junior engineers igo</p>
<p>in the preparation of these books also proved unsuccessful. In the end it was Snes : i ee<br>i apparent that, in order to insure a satisfactory job, a great deal of time was f TE<br>required of senior engineers, both in the contractors’ organizations. and in the eee ae ae<br>i : “&gt; .Naval Reactors Branch.<br>. The bocks for the Nautilus and Seawolf cost approximately $200,000 total. |<br>i é Each of these books was incorporated into 6 volumes totaling 35 chapters con-&#x27; |<br>] taining approximately 1,400 pages. ‘Lwo hundred sets of these books have been’ |<br>distributed to shipyards, submarine tenders, technical desks, and other appro-<br>:</p>
<p>priate personnel throughout the Navy. The preparation of these books in itself<br>i fulfilled a major training function; their existence forms a basis for design of<br>‘ future plants and provides raw material for training of new personnel,</p>
<p>8. Training by participation in disassembly of radicactive Canadian and : ss Sie | |<br>Oak Ridge reactors ; wind |</p>
<p>1 On December 12, 1952, an accident damaged the NRX reactor at Chalk River, ; WEG<br>: : Ontario, and spread large quantities of radioactivity throughout the reactor’. ; } |<br>Structure and building. This required complete disassembly and decontamina- &#x27; : hee if |<br>tion of the reactor, decontamination of the reactor building, and reassembly of as<br>hew components inte the system. : it |<br>The Naval Reactors Branch utilized this situation to provide training for : if |<br>personnel in actual reactor decontamination and repair. A total of 214 persons &quot; |</p>
<p>from the Naval Reactor Program expended 1,800 man-days of labor and absorbed ’ : i<br>{ about 500 roentgens of radiation among them. As a part of this effort, United peas<br>q States decontamination equipment, radiation detection instrumentation, and. ; ek ft<br>] personnel protection equipment were shipped to Chalk River. ee On<br>q &lt; The operation was.a complicated one, requiring considerable on-the-spot plan- eee ; mak |</p>
<p>&#x27; ning and work with wooden mockups outside of the radioactively contaminated alae ard</p>
<p>zone. Procedures for accomplishing this were developed as the job progressed, aan | |<br>; and equipment and techniques were evaluated. oa<br>Some time later, when the Homogeneous Reactor Experiment ( HRE) at Oak ae i<br>. Ridge was disassembled, several men from the Naval Reactors Program were ct |<br>sent to Cak Ridge for a similar purpose. As a result ef this training, over 200 ;<br>men in the Naval Reactors Program have now obtained first-hand experience : : |<br>working with highly radioactive piping and components, doing repair work vy oat</p>
<p>| under highly adverse radiological conditions. This experience cannot be simu- ; :<br>i lated by artificial means, and the training value of this work is considered high. wl</p>
<p>4. Training in statistics and design of experiments</p>
<p>q</p>
<p>| Design and operation cf nuclear powerplants. require a higher. level of: : :<br>| training and competence than does most engineering. To help obtain a high: ee caf<br>| level of engineering in all of the naval nuclear development work, courses ;<br>{ have been instigated at the Bettis plant and at the Knolls Atomic Power Labora-<br>tory (IKKAPL) in statistical design and analysis of experiments. It is planned to ‘ : i<br>establish such courses. at the..Combustion Engineering Nuclear Engineering : : f<br>{ Laboratory and perhaps at the shipyards as well. “Education of nuclear engi- ; Bo a |<br>1 3 neers in this field is considered to be essential to the rapid Gevelopment of “ ee |</p>
<p>huchear power,</p>
<p>136 SHORTAGE OF SCIENTIFIC 4ND ENGINEERING MANPOWER</p>
<p>Vulltime senior statisticians have been hired at Bettis and at KAPL for<br>this purpose and courses are s00n to be given at both places to ail engineers<br>and scientists. ‘The Naval Reactors Branch has taken the initiative in estab-<br>lishing these programs and has made available the services of a senior statis-<br>tician in the Bureau of Ships to analyze expe “imental programs and to help<br>evolve programs of maximum effectiveness. 7</p>
<p>it ig intended to apply the science of statistically designing experiments to<br>all appropriate parts of the naval nuclear program as soon as personnel be-<br>come trained in its use. 5</p>
<p>Il, RECRUITING TECHNICAL PERSONNEL</p>
<p>Once it is recognized that one eannot recruit experienced nuclear power<br>engineers, the method of. obtaining technical personnel changes. The naval<br>program has not attempted to obtain reactor people from other nuclear proj-<br>ects but instead has tried to hire persons of sound teehnical background and<br>potential for development and has assumed the burden of training them as<br>deseribed above. r</p>
<p>In the Naval Reactors Branch itself, civilian employees are reeruited directly<br>from colleges. Applicants are sereened at universities or written applications<br>are reviewed in Washington. These applicants who appear promising are<br>asked to come to Washington at their own expense for Saturday interviews.<br>JOach man is interviewed by 83 to 5 top techaical personnel for 30 minutes to an<br>hour each, and then by Admiral Rickover. During the past 6 months, 37 civilian<br>applications were reviewed, 26 of these individuals were interviewed in Wash-<br>ington, and 6 were selected for employmeut. These statistics are typical of the<br>last 2 or 3 years.</p>
<p>A similar story of selection and training exists for naval officers, but is not</p>
<p>considered pertinent to this report.<br>IV. MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF OTTER SKILLS</p>
<p>The training discussed above will be continued and expanded until all of the<br>technical and semitechnical personnel working in the naval reactors program<br>have been given an appropriately detailed competence in nuclear power engineer-<br>ing. This training, as bas been noted, extends to draftsmen and technicians as<br>well as to professional people. The training is intended to develop in engineers a<br>fetailed competence in the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, metallurgy, and<br>mathematics. The scientists in the program are in turn given basic under-<br>standing of the engineering problems involved jn the plant.</p>
<p>However, in spite of this program to. create through training a large number<br>of nuclear specialists, it is essential that existing skills be utilized to a maximum<br>extent, particularly while the number of persons highly trained in the details<br>of nuclear engineering and physics are so few. There are four areas in which<br>this is being done in the naval program:</p>
<p>(a). There is a continual effort to build up outside, nonnuclear organizations</p>
<p>to handle more and more parts of the program, SO that these tasks need not be<br>g, and testing of</p>
<p>done by the AEC laboratories. Development, manufacturin:<br>special reactor-plant components such as pumps, heat exchangers, valves, and<br>reactor control mechanisms have now been turned almost entirely over to outside<br>firms. In addition, construction of considerable highly specialized equipment<br>and prosecution of many development projects have been subcontracted. Iiven<br>the nuclear reactor cores themselves will soon be manufactured by industrial<br>concerns outside of the AEG laboratories. This has been made possible by in-<br>tensive specialized training of these organizations by senior personnel of the<br>Naval Reactors Branch and its reactor contractors.</p>
<p>(bd) Because of the acute shortage of nuclear physicists, special efforts have<br>been made to train engineers to take over more activities normally handled by</p>
<p>physicists.</p>
<p>“oritieal experiments”) ; interpretation of experimental and theoretical data<br>from the physics groups, and application of this information to reactor design.<br>In most cases a great deal of specialized. training is required to equip engineers<br>to do these jobs well, but it has been found that freeing the physicists from these</p>
<p>essentially engineering aspects of nuclear-reactor design allows the physicists<br>more time to do work for which their special educ<br>and the resultant application of engineering to t<br>been highly beneficial.</p>
<p>he nuclear physics domain has</p>
<p>These include design, construction, and operation of nuclear mockups .</p>
<p>ation and aptitude equips:them,,</p>
<p>SHORTAGH OF SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING MANPOWER 137</p>
<p>(c) Experienced engineers with no nuclear background can be trained with<br>only a small anvount of specially aimed nuclear training to do a competent job of<br>engineering design and computation on many aspects of reactors aud their<br>associated equipment and systems. As in the previous ease, the use of such<br>men, experienced in other fields of eugineering, is often more successful than the<br>exclusive use of young engineers experienced only by brief exposure to: nuclear<br>engineering, ; ;</p>
<p>(d) In many fields work is normally done by nuclear scientists or engineers<br>which ean be done as well or bettex by trained technicians, This includes opera-<br>tlon of some experimental equipment, including evtteal facilities; many aspects<br>of preparation and running problems: through large-scale digital computing<br>machines; and other phases of the experimental program. Intelligent training<br>courses specifically devised for preparing technicians for these jobs have freed<br>an appreciable number of nuclear scientists and engineers for work which<br>demands the professional background: :</p>
<p>Hach. of these problems has been the subject of several meetings between the<br>Naval Reactors Branch and company management, and specitic steps were taken<br>locally along the lines indicated above. In some cases, scientists were dubious</p>
<p>that these changes could be successful, and they were then made experimentally -</p>
<p>in particular test cases. These have nearly all been highly successful and<br>further moves in this. direction are planned,</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF JOHN F. HILLIARD, OF THE OFFICE OF DEFENSE<br>MOBILIZATION</p>
<p>Mr. Wurrarp. Mr. Chairman, I would like to express the apprecia-<br>tion of the Office of Defense Mobilization for the opportunity to con-<br>tribute our views to these hearings. I have had the opportunity to<br>look over some of the statements that have been made by various ex-<br>perts in the past, today, and 1 would like to associate myself with them<br>in their estimate of the extreme seriousness of this problem.</p>
<p>Since you have called a very distinguished group of individuals<br>who are in position to talk on a great range of problems and possibly<br>solutions in connection with the shortage of scientists and engineers,<br>T would like to take just a few minutes and address myseli to the<br>specific role and responsibilities of the Office of Defense Mobilization,<br>and to indicate very briefly what we believe the fundamental problems<br>nre that should be attacked and are being attacked, and then to attempt<br>to answer any questions that you may want to ask me.</p>

<p>When the Office of Defense Mobilization was established in 1951,<br>just a month after that the President announced at the recommenda-<br>tion of the Director of Defense Mobilization a national manpower<br>mobilization policy, one part of which read as follows:</p>
<p>We must rely heavily upon sclence and technology. he most effective use<br>must be made of our supply of individuals having the special skills required to<br>develop and produce the necessary equipment and to use and maintain it in the<br>Armed Forces. ;</p>
