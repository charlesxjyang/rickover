      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This document contains Admiral Hyman G. Rickover&#x27;s comments from September 1, 1980, celebrating the successful conclusion of the USS Arkansas&#x27;s first propulsion sea trial, which included a 4-hour full power run exceeding 30 knots. Rickover commends the Tenneco management and the &quot;ready made and fine organization&quot; of designers, engineers, and trades people at Newport News, citing the yard&#x27;s historic motto, &quot;We will build good ships at a profit if we can, at a loss if we must, but always good ships,&quot; established by its founder, C.P. Huntington. He particularly praises the officers and men of the *Arkansas*, noting with admiration that an impressive 60% of the crew had no prior sea experience, yet they &quot;handled the ship like veterans&quot; and demonstrated outstanding capability.</p>

        <p>1 SEPTEMBER 1980<br>ADMIRAL RICKOVER‘s COMMENTS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE ARKANSAS<br>PROPULSION SEA TRIAL:</p>
<p>1, WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST SEA TRIAL OF THE ARKANSAS,</p>
<p>THE PROPULSION PLANT SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THE TRIALS, INCLUDING</p>
<p>A 4-HOUR FULL POWER RUN AT A SPEED GREATER THAN 30 KNOTS.</p>
<p>2, THE TENNECO MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT IT TOOK</p>
<p>OVER SUCH A READY MADE AND FINE ORGANIZATION OF DESIGNERS,<br>ENGINEERS, DRAFTMEN, AND TRADES PEOPLE. CHET LONG WHO HAS BEEN</p>
<p>IN CHARGE OF THE TRIALS FOR NEWPORT NEWS, IS AN EXAMPLE OF MANY<br>OTHERS WHO HAVE FOR YEARS DESIGNED AND BUILT GOOD SHIPS, THE<br>MOTTO OF NEWPORT NEWS USED TO BE “WE WILL BUILD Goon SHIPS AT</p>
<p>A PROFIT IF WE CAN, AT A LOSS IF WE MUST, BUT ALWAYS GOOD SHIPS,”<br>THIS MOTTO WAS SET BY MR. C.P, HUNTINGTON, THE RAILROAD MAN WHO<br>FOUNDED THE YARD IN THE 1880&#x27;s. IT USED TO BE DISPLAYED ON A |<br>ROCK IN THE SHIPYARD; IT IS NOW IN THE MUSEUM,</p>
<p>3. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL OF THE SKILLED PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS<br>SHIP. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SUPERVISOR OF SHIPBUILDING, THE<br>REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BOARD OF INSPECTION AND SURVEY, THE</p>
<p>NAVY AND THE CONTRACTOR REPRESENTATIVE, ALL WORKED HARD TO BRING<br>ABOUT THIS SUCCESSFUL TRIAL.</p>
<p>4, BUT PARTICULARLY I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE OFFICERS AND</p>
<p>MEN OF THE ARKANSAS. ANYONE WITNESSING THESE TRIALS WOULD FIND</p>
<p>IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 60% OF THE CREW HAVE HAD No PREVIOUS SEA<br>EXPERIENCE,</p>
<p>5. THE MEN AND OFFICERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEY ARE CAPABLE OF<br>DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB, YOU HANDLED THE SHIP LIKE VETERANS,</p>
<p>I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM YOUR DUTIES IN THE SAME<br>OUTSTANDING MANNER. OUR COUNTRY IS PROUD OF CAPTAIN REED,<br>HIS OFFICERS, AND HIS MEN,</p>
<p>6. IN BEHALF OF THE NAVY I THANK YOU FOR A JOB WELL DONE,</p>
<p>i</p>
