      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In a February 1959 speech to the North Carolina State College Union, VADM H. G. Rickover, a key figure in naval nuclear propulsion, underscored the vital link between national competence, technological progress, and a robust education system in a democracy. Drawing from his experience developing nuclear reactors for the Navy, he highlighted the demanding standards required for atomic energy, criticizing an &quot;educational lag&quot; in the U.S. that led to extended &quot;lead times&quot; compared to Russia. Rickover passionately advocated for a fundamental overhaul of American education, arguing against an &quot;easy subject&quot; curriculum and vocational training in favor of a rigorous, liberal education for all citizens. He asserted that a well-educated populace, capable of critical thought and understanding complex scientific and technical issues, is essential for a functioning democracy and for the nation to maintain its global standing, citing figures like Montesquieu and Jefferson to support his views on the necessity of widespread, high-quality education.</p>

<p>I am delighted to be here, in the home territory of my good<br>friend, the Honorable Carl Durham, and to speak to his many<br>friends in North Carolina. TI Should like first to pay tribute to<br>the Congressman and to his colleagues on the Joint Congressional<br>Committee on Atomic Energy. The members of this Committee have<br>an understanding of the technical aspects of nuclear fission and<br>a grasp of the potentialites of atomic energy for naval propulsion<br>today and for civilian power production tomorrow that is most<br>unusual among laymen; it is unusual even among engineers! Their<br>mastery of the complicated subject over which they exercise<br>legislative supervision is not, in my opinion, matched by any<br>other committee of the Congress. We are fortunate to have men<br>in the Congress who possess the vision to look beyond the present<br>power and affluence of our country to the needs of the future, and</p>
<p>who are prepared to take action te meet these needs in time,</p>
<p>Copyright 1959, H. a. Rickover<br>No permission needed for contemporaneous press use.</p>
<p>Above copyright notice to be used if most of Speech reprinted,</p>
<p>Nuclear reactors are, of course, but one of the many aspects<br>of atomic development with which the Committee concerns itself.<br>I speak from personal experience when I say that without the<br>Support that its members have unfailingly given to my group,<br>conversion of our fleet to atomic energy would have been delayed<br>and might have come too late to be of any practical use to the<br>United States,</p>
<p>I hope that Mr. Durham will not consider me presumptious if<br>I say that when the members of the Committee began their work--a<br>dozen or so years ago--they knew as little about nuclear physics<br>and engineering as I then did. We are, so to speak, classmates<br>fer we began to work with nuclear energy about the same time.<br>The Committee was given the unusual task of presiding over the<br>birth of a power revolution that will doubtlessly have far-reaching<br>effects equal to, if not sreater than, those wrought by the<br>revolutions that ushered in the ages of steam and electricity.<br>I know of no previous case of a congressional or parliamentary<br>committee being charged with responsibility for overseeing a<br>Similar enterprise. To carry out their assignment, the members<br>of the Committee had to master the equivalent of a college course<br>in a complicated technical sub ject and do it while carrying on<br>their regular work. Similarly, we in the naval nuclear propulsion<br>group had to learn this whole new subject through practical<br>experience on the Job. We kept passing on what we had learned to</p>
<p>new members of our group, thus Slowly building up a corps of</p>
<p>nuclear engineers, The entire reactor program was a bootstrap</p>
<p>operation from the start, Work, study, and teaching went on<br>Simultaneously. It didn&#x27;t come easy. Few of us were exactly<br>college age!</p>
<p>The specter of Russia&#x27;s giant Scientific strides lent urgency</p>
<p>to our work, We decided to save time by telescoping the procedures</p>
<p>usually followed in new engineering projects. As you know, the<br>Sequence normally runs from basic research to applied research,<br>to the laboratory or &quot;pread-board&quot; model, and finally to the<br>full-scale working model. We Skipped the stage when theory is<br>tried out on laboratory or &quot;pread-board&quot; models, and designed our<br>reactors to fit directly into Ships and power Stations. This was<br>@ gamble that we could not have undertaken had we not been<br>fortunate enough to receive the backing of the Joint Congressional<br>Committee, With their Support we were able to eut construction<br>time for the first atomic submarine by several years, The<br>NAUTILUS was in fact designed and built within the time usually<br>required for the building of a conventional submarine, Omitting<br>the laboratory model Stage did increase our difficulties, however,<br>To most laymen--and alas even more so to public relations<br>men--a laboratory model always seems to be practically equivalent<br>to the finished, working product, But, this is not So. We have<br>many laboratory reactors; reactors that produce some electricity<br>under ideal laboratory conditions, and much is to be learned from</p>
<p>them. There is a world of difference, however, between a research</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>or experimental reactor and one that must actually produce useful<br>power for a naval ship or a utility system. Whereas laboratory<br>conditions favor the new project, reality is troublesome.</p>
<p>It is troublesome because as soon as you move from the<br>laboratory to the practical world you must deal with people outside<br>your own group, over whose qualifications you exercise no control.</p>
<p>I use the utmost care in choosing the engineers--naval and civilian--<br>for my Own reactor group and I can, therefore, influence the quality<br>of their design work. But for construction of our reactors and of<br>the ships and power stations into which they are to be fitted, we<br>depend on governmental and industrial organizations that do not<br>Specialize in atomic energy. Most of their work is with<br>conventional types of ships and power plants. Their managers, as<br>@ rule, lack familiarity with the peculiarities of the atom.<br>Therefore, they tend to go about building reactors and nuclear<br>Ships in the old and tried ways that were appropriate for<br>conventional jobs. It has taken much time and effort to convince<br>them that nuclear power is a more exacting kind of energy than<br>steam or diesel power. Old established organizations develop<br>undue veneration for routines and protocol and it is extremely<br>difficult for their managers to realize that what suffices for<br>conventional work is quite insufficient for new engineering<br>projects. We had, and still have, the utmost difficulty getting<br>the idea across that technological breakthroughs ean never be</p>
<p>brought about by routine methods and protocel. The ‘essence of</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>all progress is a shedding of preconceived ideas and accustomed<br>ways of doing things and a venturing into the unknown where one<br>is necessarily guided more by intuition and imagination than by<br>established rules and regulations. How else can anything new be<br>created?</p>
<p>Every attempt to pioneer beyond established techniques has</p>
<p>to overcome two sets of problems. Both are the result of an</p>
<p>educational lag which leaves us unprepared to cope with the</p>
<p>increasing complexities of an ever rising level of technology.</p>
<p>hh<br>The first set of problems is technical, etic who works</p>
<p>on design or construction of new engineering projects must be far<br>more rigorously trained in their specialties than may have hitherto</p>
<p>been necessary. They must, in particular, be more thoroughly</p>
<p>grounded in basic principles. Furthermore, the mere ability to</p>
<p>apply these principles routinely which may suffice in performing</p>
<p>established engineering tasks does not suffice when engaged in</p>
<p>developing a novel project. Only after mastering these basic</p>
<p>principles, will they be able to devise the new ways of applying</p>
<p>these principles which will make a pioneering project feasible,<br>The second set of problems is general rather than technical.</p>
<p>Those in government and industry who administer or utilize novel</p>
<p>engineering projects must be far more competent in their own fields</p>
<p>of responsibility. Broader knowledge is also needed by the general<br>public if it is to guide technological progress in a wise and</p>
<p>efficient manner. We cannot advance unless we pay the price of |</p>
<p>5 |</p>
<p>progress’ whith ‘B°dncredsed ‘competence: and ability to think on higher</p>
<p>intellectual levels, Education alone--whe ther formal or self-<br>acquired--will enable us to rise to our new responsibilities ang<br>thus to move ahead rapidly.</p>
<p>The atom sets its own categorical imperatives which we have<br>ho choice but to accept, Specifically this means that the<br>engineers in my reactor Sroup must perform at higher levels of<br>engineering competence; industry must raise its standards of<br>management and productive accuracy well above those which suffice<br>for routine manufacturing and construction Jobs; the officers and<br>men who operate nuclear ships and the personnel who run the</p>
<p>Shippingport atomic power Station must be far more competent</p>
<p>policies, those in government who have to decide how reactors may</p>
<p>- best be used to the advantage of the United States must have a<br>thorough comprehension of the potentialities and limitations of<br>nuclear bower; above all, they must. be familiar with the Special<br>safety considerations involved in the use of this rélatively untried</p>
<p>new force of nature,</p>
<p>except by highly competent persons under rigid safety precautions,</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>cannot deal efficiently--or even safely--with new and increasingly</p>
<p>complex technical developments unless one has himself attained<br>greater technical knowledge and-achieved 4 higher level of human<br>competence, I do not exaggerate when I say that a major part of<br>my own time and that of my top engineers must be diverted from our<br>regular job and devoted to a never-ending battle for higher levels<br>of performance by people outside my own group who make decisions<br>about the building or use of nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>To those of us who have gone through the laborious process of<br>self-education on the job, which is required when one attempts a<br>technological advance, it is self-evident that the need for more<br>rigorous standards of performance is inherent in the nature of<br>atomic energy and has nothing personal about it. In fact,<br>personalities ought never to intrude into technical matters, They<br>do, however, because in this country we place extraordinary emphasis<br>on getting along with people, on conforming to accepted ways of<br>doing things, and on maintaining pleasant social relationships in<br>our business contacts.</p>
<p>Insistence on high standards of performance tends to be<br>regarded as impolite, even rude. One is therefore confronted with<br>the choice between letting standards Slide and so failing in onets<br>assigned task, or of incurring personal unpopularity. of course,<br>if it were generally understood that no new project can be pushed<br>through without exaction of new standards of performance, our</p>
<p>demand for higher standards would not be resented, It is ignorance</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>of the complexities of nuclear fission which causes friction and</p>
<p>a hostile attitude towards the rigorous specifications we are</p>
<p>compelled to exact.</p>
<p>The climb upward is always difficult and painful. It is<br>rendered still more onerous when one must periodically stop and<br>convince reluctant climbers that it is really necessary to reach<br>a higher plateau. Time thus lost in argument shows up in<br>lengthening lead times, that is in prolongation of the period which<br>elapses between conception of a new idea and it utilization in a<br>useful object; as for example, between Einsteints formulation<br>of the equation E = Mc* and completion of the first atomic bomb<br>or nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>The imaginative creativity of the theoretical scientist who<br>deals with abstract concepts is always ahead of the technical and<br>administrative competence of those who translate the abstract into<br>the concrete. How fast we progress technologically depends largely<br>on the time it takes us to put new scientific ideas to practical<br>use. Since the end of World War II, lead times have been<br>_ lengthening alarmingly in this country--from 24 years during the<br>war to ten years today. In Russia, meanwhile, lead time on military<br>items is said to have been reduced to but five years. This is a<br>serious matter for we are living in an era when technological<br>progress has become a necessity if we are to deal adequately with<br>the problems arising from population growth and resources</p>
<p>exhaustion,</p>
<p>Moreover, with the world situation as 4t is today, our country</p>
<p>must advance rapidly if it is to retain its present position of<br>power. Delay in utilizing new 4deas could spell disaster. Anyone<br>familiar with history knows that a slight advantage » grasped and<br>exploited by one side, has often totally altered power relationships.<br>Today changes occur faster than ever pefore. We can no longer<br>afford the luxury of ignorance of scientific and technical matters<br>which produces delays and lengthens our lead times. Leaders in<br>industry and government must acquire a petter understanding of<br>science and its inexorable laws so that they will find it less<br>repugnant to consult technical experts, even those who are their<br>subordinates.</p>
<p>The man of the future on whom we shall depend more and more<br>is the technical expert. Today he is still subservient to non-<br>technical administrators ana his work is hampered and sometimes<br>destroyed by men in whom is vested great power but who are unable<br>to understand the realities of the new, artificial world which<br>the scientific revolution is ereating almost overnight. In the<br>future, both a great deal more technical knowledge and a better<br>understanding of the world we live in will be required of all those<br>who run large organizations. The purely &quot;verbal&quot; men are on the<br>way out; the men who can handle the intricate mysteries of complex<br>setentific and engineering projects are on the way in. This applies<br>all along the line to the skilled workman on whose judgment,</p>
<p>concentrated attention, and sense of personal responsibility may</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>depend the functioning of some new and gigantic piece of engineering.<br>To put this in military terms, we shall need more technical sergeants<br>and - fewer martinets. In our naval nuclear program we have taken<br>cognizance of this demand for a different kind of man and we have |<br>set up schools to train the officers and men who will operate the<br>new atomic navy,</p>
<p>But the need for higher competence is not limited to leaders<br>who Supervise and direct large organizations, or to the professional<br>people who run our complex society, or to the scientists and<br>engineers who move us ahead technologically--this higher competence<br>is required of all of us. This is SO because ours is a democracy<br>and no democracy can function properly if the majority does not<br>understand what the minority does, In a thoughtful editorial<br>introducing their new series of articles entitled &quot;Adventures of<br>the Mind,&quot; the Saturday Evening Post Said, &quot;The fact is that what<br>the scholar thinks, the artist creates, the scientist discovers,<br>cannot achieve full reality without the rest of uS. Without us<br>no idea or institution can flourish.&quot; Democracy is in serious<br>danger if the mass of our eitizens whose beliefs and attitudes<br>Shape national policy and determine national meres are out of<br>teuch with the talented minority who push us ahead technologically<br>and from whose ranks come all the trained professionals who run<br>our complex Society. Life on a high level of technology cannot<br>be lived democratically unless all the people raise their human</p>
<p>Stature so that they may be competent to judge and direct the</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>mew forces that our creative brainworkers are bringing under<br>man&#x27;s control.</p>
<p>With atomic energy we have moved to the point where man<br>creates new elements; thus, we are now twice removed from the<br>natural raw material. Utilization of the power of nuclear fission</p>
<p>is but one of several projects now under way that involve moving</p>
<p>to higher technological levels. To understand and take part in</p>
<p>such efforts demands more of a people than the marvelous<br>practicality for which Americans have long been famous. In the<br>past, this practicality served us well, for our principal task was<br>the taming of this continent; the exploitation of the natural<br>wealth of this new land. To do this all we needed was ability</p>
<p>to adapt and apply scientific techniques developed elsewhere.</p>
<p>But this practical ability no longer suffices, for now our<br>principal task has become more complex and difficult. We are<br>presently engaged in making over the world to suit our needs--</p>
<p>a different objective altogether than merely making use of what</p>
<p>is at hand. As our population soars--at present rates it will<br>double in less than 40 years--and as our free space and our<br>natural resources shrink, we must turn more and more toward</p>
<p>science to devise substitutes for these resources. In a democracy,<br>the people must therefore understand enough about science and<br>scientists to direct scientific work toward socially desirable<br>ends. If the people shirk the effort to acquire this understanding</p>
<p>of science, they will not, in the long run, obtain maximum benefit</p>
<p>li</p>
<p>from seience and preserve their democratic rights as well,</p>
<p>Nor can a democratic people indulge in the luxury of<br>ignorance of the humanities, for these too become more important<br>as the world becomes more crowded and people and nations become<br>more dependent on one another. To sustain a free technological<br>Society today, the people must be informed in the fundamentals<br>of the sciences and of the humanities. No better foundation for<br>a modern democracy can be built than an educational system open<br>to all children that helps them to acquire civilized minds through<br>a liberal education.</p>
<p>More than two hundred years ago, Montesquieu remarked that<br>the principle of aristocratic forms of government is honor, of<br>tyrannies fear, and of democracies education, Although he<br>profoundly influenced our Founding Fathers, Montesquieuts<br>perception of the interdependence of democracy and education<br>appears to have been fully grasped only by Jefferson who drew<br>the correct conclusion that democracies must provide for the<br>education of all their citizens. The educational plan he drew<br>up for Virginia was far in advance of. then current ideas,<br>Everywhere education was then considered a private enterprise<br>catering solely to those destined to-become the future leaders of<br>the country, But in a democracy all the citizens are in a sense<br>the leaders of their country and hence all need the type of<br>education which has been found best for developing the qualities</p>
<p>needed to govern wisely. We cannot improve on Jeffersonts</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>categorical statement that &quot;if a nation expects to be ignorant</p>
<p>and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was<br>and never will be.&quot;</p>
<p>This is so because in a democracy sovereignty resides in<br>the people, They rule, though for practical purposes they do so<br>through their elected representatives, Only in very small states<br>has it proved practicable for the people to rule directly--as in<br>a few Swiss cantons and in the city states of classical Greece,<br>There each voter is intimately associated with the business of<br>governing, and therefore not likely to forget that he ig a puler,<br>When countries grow populous and gsovernment becomes huge and<br>unwieldy, we tend to forget that we must all conduct ourselves<br>as good rulers,</p>
<p>In his long. history, man has seldom had the good fortune to<br>be ruled wisely and competently. But when he has had rulers or<br>ruling elasses who governed well, it has almost always been<br>because they had been carefully educated for their responsibilities,<br>Since our children will all become rulers of this country, we<br>must educate them equally carefully for their responsibilities.<br>Every child should receive an education which enables him to<br>understand the world he lives in, the forces which shape his society,<br>and the.place his country occupies amone other nations, He must<br>be able to formulate intelligent and independent decisions based<br>on proven facts, and he must develop considerable toughness in</p>
<p>the face of flattery for he cannot afford to have illusions: he</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>must be a realist. He must also be a patriot. In final analysis,</p>
<p>the fate of every democracy depends on whether a majority of the<br>voters have so strong a sense of identification with their country<br>that they will voluntarily put national interest above personal</p>
<p>or group interests when the two conflict,</p>
<p>Democracy is the only government worthy of free men; it is<br>also the most difficult. It will not run well unless all the<br>people, or at least a majority, possess those qualities of mind<br>and character that in other forms of government are needed by<br>none but a small governing group. We are not born with these<br>qualities. We must acquire them through effort; we must be<br>carefully guided and taught by home, church, and school. Hence<br>the over-riding importance of education in a democracy, education<br>which enhances the human personality--not narrow vocational<br>training to equip young people with a saleable skill--for in a<br>democracy people are much more than mere breadwinners.</p>
<p>What is often lost sight of is that while technological<br>progress lightens the burden of earning one&#x27;s daily bread, it<br>simultaneously increases the burden of democratic éitizenship.<br>Life becomes complicated and artificial. National principles<br>must be constantly adapted to new circumstances if they are not<br>to become a dead letter. Equality, for example, is one of the<br>basic democratic principles which we are currently applying to<br>public education in a manner which tends to defeat the whole</p>
<p>purpose of education in a democracy. We seek to level children</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>into homogeneity by forcing identical education on all, vegardless</p>
<p>of whether this really educates them or not. Obviously, children<br>have different mental capacities, different motivations, and<br>different speeds of learning. If we lump them together in huge<br>comprehensive schools, we do justice to but the tiny minority<br>exactly in the center of the ability scale. We are thus using a<br>public agency--the school--to undo the inequality of intellectual<br>power conferred on us by the Lord.</p>
<p>It strikes me as somewhat blasphemous to do this. The only<br>real equality is equality of opportunity; that is, the lowering<br>by society of artificial barriers which would prevent a child<br>from obtaining the best education he is able to absorb. This is<br>what the European democracies have long since provided for their<br>youth. Sensibly, they realize that education is not a material<br>thing, or a prestige item that must be handed out in equal doses,<br>since it is valueless unless the receiver is willing and able to<br>benefit by education. Yet in this country we still brand European<br>education as aristotratic and we wax indignant at their practice<br>of sorting out children by ability and giving each the kind of<br>education he is best able to absorb.</p>
<p>In order to preserve a narrow and mistaken concept of<br>democratic education, we are currently depriving many of our<br>talented, and almost all our average children, of the benefits<br>of general or liberal education which enhances man&#x27;s stature and</p>
<p>therefore enables him to live a fuller, more interesting, and</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>more satisfying life. Because we cannot impart this general</p>
<p>education to all children simultaneously, we have downgraded<br>curricula in the direction of what are termed &quot;common needs of<br>youth&quot; ~-vocational training, and the teaching of manners, leisure<br>time skills, and the like. These do almost nothing to prepare<br>youth for the demands of the twentieth century, either in their<br>private lives or in their role as democratic citizens. These<br>courses do not &quot;bring the mina into form,&quot; to use the words of<br>John Henry Newman in which he expresses the objective of general<br>as opposed to vocational education, or what he called<br>&quot;entertainment&quot; education--teaching good grooming, how to fish,<br>or how to be socially popular, for example,</p>
<p>In aristocracies, the value of general or liberal education<br>has always been well understood by parents belonging to the<br>groups that provided national direction and leadership; so well<br>that almost all their children managed to acquire it, Those of<br>average ability did so by dint of parental encouragement, coaxing,<br>help, and Sometimes compulsion; by hard work and, when necessary,<br>repetition of grades, Somehow they acquired a liberal education<br>and it was well worth the effort and the occasional heartbreak<br>of individual failure. Parents dig not make the mistake so<br>common with us of leaving to the children themselves the planning<br>of their education. It is nothing but maudlin sentimentality<br>and an unrealistic notion of the child&#x27;s “democratic rights&quot;</p>
<p>which keep so many of our children from acquiring the solid</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>e@wantages of a proad general education.</p>
<p>The law everywhere recognizes the Limited judgment of minors<br>end protects them against their own smmaturity but in American<br>education we not only fail to protect the minor against nis.<br>ammature desire for easy, snap courses, We actually seduce him<br>4nto abandoning the effort to reach the highest possible human<br>stature he can achieve by offering a veritable cafeteria of<br>tempting dishes requiring no effort at all on his part, and<br>especially little or no homework. These “easy sub ject dishes&quot;<br>also have the so-called &quot;Neavantage” that they do not show up<br>mental inequalities as do those of the liberal arts curriculum;<br>(also, they are easier to teach!}</p>
<p>We make a mockery of the noble concept of universal free<br>education when we eliminate from education everything that spurs<br>the child to effort. It is official educationist dogma that<br>&quot;there is no aristocracy of tgubjects!.. mathematics and mechanics;<br>art and agriculture, history and homemaking are all peers.&quot; All<br>win for the pupil the same credit toward his final diploma or<br>degree; all are open to every pupil regardless of his ability.<br>Thus do we eliminate competition and reward from the child&#x27;s<br>most important pusiness--growing up to be a worthwhile adult. In<br>every other human activity we recognize that people do their best<br>when they are challenged by competition. We know that effort will<br>pring reward. Not so in education. Here we actually pride</p>
<p>ourselves on sparing the lazy and the stupid ehild the</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>disappointment of failure. To save the sensibilities of the</p>
<p>incompetent, we neglect the talented. And even the average<br>child with sufficient motivation to absorb at least part of a<br>liberal education all too often misses out because he has not<br>been properly guided and spurred on to exert himself.</p>
<p>Todayts effort to wrap children in cotton wool and protect<br>them against every risk of school life contrasts with the way<br>children were raised in pioneer days. No parent would then<br>have dreamed of sparing his son the risk of possible accident<br>py not teaching him how to shoot a rifle. Survival in pioneer<br>days depended on being a handy shot; the risk of a ehild hurting |<br>himself had to be taken. Today survival depends on ability to<br>raise one&#x27;s intellectual capacities to higher levels than were<br>ever before needed; yet many American parents will not accept<br>the risk of their child hurting himself by failing in a tough<br>curriculum. Ability to think is as important today as ability<br>to shoot was yesterday. Although our folklore has little<br>admiration for the pampered child of rich parents, now that most<br>of us are rich beyond the dreams of people elsewhere in this<br>world; richer by far than most ruling classes were a few generations<br>ago--now we engage in that very pampering which we once scorned.</p>
<p>A peculiar sense of logic permits us to award the star<br>athlete all sorts of honors, thereby motivating him to practice<br>hard and continuously; while to do the same for children of</p>
<p>superior intelligence and scholastic achievement is &quot;undemocratic,&quot;</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>so we are told. We like to think of ourselves as a practical,</p>
<p>realistic people. Yet we cherish athletic prowess for which<br>there is limited use in today&#x27;s urban life and we deprecate<br>intellectual prowess of which we have too little and need a<br>great deal,</p>
<p>We want our children to lead a happy and rich life but<br>instead of teaching them to develop their inner resources we<br>waste their best learning years on training them how to be<br>socially popular and how to find a mate. Much of the<br>&quot;entertainment&quot; type education given in our schools could well<br>be given after school hours and at the expense of the interested<br>families. I am old-fashioned enough to feel that taxes ought<br>to be invested in educating children for real life and not for<br>having a good time.</p>
<p>In setting educational objectives, one may take the view<br>that these must achieve what is best for the individual, or one .<br>may take the view that they must aim at what is best for society.<br>In democracies, fortunately, that education which enables the<br>individual to make full use of every one. of his abilities<br>because all have been developed to their maximum potential - that<br>education also prepares him best for democratic citizenship.<br>There is much talk in educationist circles about educating the<br>“whole” child but unfortunately this is interpreted as education<br>which tries to take on the entire development of a child in the</p>
<p>short 180-day school year prevailing in this country. This.is</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>an impossible objective and must end in developing no part of</p>
<p>the child&#x27;s abilities properly, and in giving him merely a<br>smattering of unimportant know-how.</p>
<p>Bacon said that the mind of man is the man. If the schools<br>concentrated all their efforts toward developing the power of<br>the child&#x27;s mind, allowing only necessary time to developing his<br>physique, giving him a taste of music and art, and implanting<br>good principles of conduct, they would in fact be going far<br>toward developing the &quot;whole&quot; child.</p>
<p>A &quot;whole&quot; man uses all his faculties - none lie fallow.<br>Nothing makes life so interesting, so invigorating an adventure, -<br>as when we bring all our abilities into play. It must be that<br>we were meant to be &quot;active souls&quot; - to use Emerson&#x27;s famous<br>phrase. If we do not all live this way it is because the general<br>education which develops all our capabilities is acquired only<br>by great effort. It is seldom possible for a child to assess the<br>value of a good education, and by himself decide to acquire it.<br>But we, the people, can demand that our schools do everything in<br>their power to guide the child toward such an education. For so<br>good a purpose, we may properly use every means of persuasion,<br>including the child&#x27;s natural competitive instincts. We may<br>decide that our taxes should not be Spent on teaching children<br>to set a table or order a meal in a restaurant, but should be<br>. used only to impart education which develops the child&#x27;s total</p>
<p>personality; education which, in John Ruskin&#x27;s words, &quot;is the</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>leading of human souls to what is best, and making what is best</p>
<p>out of them; and these two objects are always attainable together,<br>and by the same means. The training which makes men happiest<br>in themselves also makes them most serviceable to others,&quot;</p>
<p>My tour of duty in Washington, and the many years I have<br>been at work trying to develop a new Source of energy, have<br>taught me one thing above all: Nothing worth having is ever<br>acquired without great effort. We tend in this country to<br>accept passively the good things which science, properly<br>exploited, can give us. We do not always realize that we must<br>in turn give something ourselves to insure that scientific<br>progress continues, This Something is the effort to raise ourselves<br>to higher levels of intellectual power and disinterested wisdom.<br>There will be no room in the new world which is just around the<br>corner for citizens--or nations--who are mentally lazy, selfish,<br>or uninformed. As we move up the ladder of civilization, we<br>must increase our over-all competence,</p>
<p>Roughly the sequence is as follows: first, man needg physical<br>strength and courage, and in pioneer societies these suffice for<br>Success in his personal life and as a democratic citizen; then<br>follows practical ability in handling concrete problems and<br>utilizing novel techniques for exploitation of natural resources<br>and production. of industrial goods; finally comes ability to<br>grasp abstract concepts of increasing complexity, As he moves</p>
<p>up the ladder, man does not discard the earlier competencies</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>but merely adds the new ones. In consequence he rises to a</p>
<p>higher level in his total humanity.</p>
<p>Today our national mores and the dogma of educationists<br>that all subjects are of equal value tend to obscure the fact<br>that one of the.great advantages of reaching a higher level of<br>education is that one escapes the narrow confines of a single<br>skill. The engineers in my group, for example, are able to do<br>extremely difficult design work, but they are also capable of<br>doing the work of technicians and mechanics. Consider the person<br>who has received a broad liberal education: he has been taught<br>no special vocational skill but the training he received has<br>made a precision tool of his intellect which equips him for the<br>study of any number of professional subjects. &quot;In all,&quot; wrote<br>Newman, &quot;what is gained by a liberal education is a faculty of<br>entering with comparative ease into any subject of thought, and<br>of taking up with aptitude any science and profession.” A<br>person&#x27;s native ability naturally affects the extent to which he ca<br>make use of his mind, but whatever his I.Q., a broad general<br>education will increase his mental capacity well above what it woul<br>be if he were merely given vocational or “entertainment” type<br>education.</p>
<p>The importance of general education for all the people tends<br>to be obscured because of the fact that its value is personal and<br>civic and not obviously utilitarian. We do not recognize its<br>value if we think of education as having no other purpose than</p>
<p>to increase our earning power. Looking at education in this</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>narrow--almost mercenary--way, we do not readily understand the</p>
<p>interrelation between technological advance and greater need<br>for higher educational levels. It is quite true that for the<br>majority of people it is now much easier to earn a good living<br>than, let us say, fifty years ago. Most people need fewer<br>special vocational Skills and will need still fewer when automation<br>takes over, Routine work is gradually being taken over by machines,<br>People are still needed to manipulate these machines, but little<br>in the way of education or specific skill is required of them,<br>We like to think that pushing buttons that start and stop machines<br>is a more dignified way of making a living than working with one&#x27;s<br>hands. No doubt it is pleasanter and physically less fatiguing.<br>But in the past when men worked with their hands, a good many of<br>them had to have special abilities and skills which set them<br>apart from others and gave them importance, Workers in<br>preindustrial’. societies had to possess more special knowledge<br>and skill than today&#x27;s machine tenders.</p>
<p>Consider the deep understanding of nature, of soil, of<br>plants and animals needed by a peasant: how carefully he must<br>plan for the future. Consider the artisan who must spend years<br>preparing himself for his particular trade. Such skilled men<br>are set apart from each other by their special abilities; they<br>are never &quot;interchangeable men,&quot; to use Robert Hutchins? term.<br>Modern man, however, tends to become merely a cog in a huge</p>
<p>production machine. Whatever vocational skill he needs can</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>usually be acquired on the job in a relatively short time. This</p>
<p>skill has been deliberately whittled down to a level where<br>practically everyone can attain it easily. There is no special<br>satisfaction to be gained from such a meager skill, other than<br>that it provides a good living for few hours of work,</p>
<p>When we substitute vocational training for general education<br>in our schools, we treat human beings as breadwinners pure and<br>simple. We leave out of consideration their needs as persons and<br>as citizens. This is an attitude often found in authoritarian<br>societies but it has no place in a democracy, particularly one<br>as rich as our country which can well afford to provide all its<br>children with a good general or liberal education. Though it<br>is not highly regarded by authoritarian governments, the<br>independence of mind which such an education develops is<br>indispensable in a democracy. Substituting vocationalism for<br>general education cheats a child of his right to become a<br>well-educated person. Let us by all means provide for all sorts<br>of extracurricular: activities which may be pleasant or marginally<br>useful to children; we can use the school buildings for this<br>after hours. But let us not substitute typewriting, metal shop<br>or driver training for history, languages, mathematics, and<br>sciences. Vocational skills were deemed sufficient for the<br>hewers of wood and the carriers of water in times gone past; they<br>are not sufficient for future democratic citizens.</p>
<p>How better can we use the wealth and the leisure which</p>
<p>e4</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>technological advances give than by investing them in a concerted</p>
<p>campaign to provide our children with the best schools and the<br>best educated teachers in the world so that all future American<br>citizens may absorb as much of a broad liberal education as is<br>humanly possible. Is there a worthier goal we can set for<br>ourselves than to help America&#x27;s youth become the most intelligent,<br>the most competent, the most patriotic, and the wisest of rulers</p>
<p>of this land of ours?</p>
