      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">In this August 30, 1974 speech to the National Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, Admiral H.G. Rickover delivers a scathing critique of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s post-World War II decline in technical competence, attributing it to an over-reliance on &quot;management systems&quot; and an excessive bureaucracy. He laments the lack of hands-on engineering experience among line officers and ship captains, contrasting this sharply with the rigorous qualification standards he implemented in the nuclear Navy. Rickover argues that the Naval Academy&#x27;s curriculum has shifted too far from engineering, citing a midshipman&#x27;s focus on &quot;mouse biorhythms&quot; as an example of misdirected education. He advocates for fundamental structural changes, including a return to a &quot;bilinear system&quot; where technical bureaus report directly to the Secretary of the Navy, the disbandment of the Chief of Naval Material&#x27;s office, and a renewed emphasis on developing in-house technical capability and long-term assignments for engineering personnel to ensure the Navy&#x27;s warfighting readiness.</p>

        <p>Wo<br>THIS SPEECH REFLECTS THE VIEWS FOR RELEASE 12:00 NOON (PDT)<br>OF THE AUTHOR AND DOES NOT FRIDAY, AUGUST 30, 1974<br>NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VIEWS<br>OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY<br>OR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY</p>
<p>Remarks by Admiral H. G. Rickover, USN before the National Society<br>of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;</p>
<p>Seattle, Washington; August 30, 1974</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, I have witnessed the deterioration<br>of the technical competence of the Navy when compared to the job the<br>Navy has todo. This deterioration has affected both the operating<br>engineers at sea and the design engineers ashore.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Navy has become lost in its organizational<br>complexity. New layers of administrators and managers, civilian and<br>naval are interposed between the high echelons of the Navy and the<br>people who are doing the actual work. These managers are empowered<br>to ask any and all questions and to stop technical work from proceeding.<br>Their endorsement must be obtained prior to forwarding a recommendation<br>to higher authority in the chain of command. But there is no one that I<br>can find in the Naval Material Command who has the authority to approve<br>proceeding with programs.</p>
<p>The growing dependence upon management systems has been another<br>characteristic which has evolved in the years since World War II.</p>
<p>Secretary McNamara, instead of requiring the Navy to build up its</p>
<p>in-house technical capability, decreed that it should depend on industry,<br>The Navy was to &quot;manage&quot; the projects which it assigned to industry,<br>His successors have followed the same path,</p>
<p>Management systems and gimmicks are now as endemic to the<br>Government as the Black Plague was in Medieval Europe,</p>
<p>What if Columbus had applied modern management systems to his<br>proposed voyage? He would have attended management seminars, He<br>would have studied tables with brightly colored Squares and broad arrows<br>to show which way plans, decisions, and problems were to go. He would<br>not have bothered with details such as navigation and seamanship. These<br>were technical matters, He would simply have &quot;managed&quot; the voyage. He<br>would have used a colored-plastic decision-making card. Further, his<br>analyst—I mean systems analyst—would have presented him with several<br>volumes proving that the venture was not cost-effective, America would</p>
<p>never have been discovered. We would all be Indians,</p>
<p>In my opinion, there has been no period in the past 50 years where<br>the Fleet has been in aS poor condition as it is today. It appears to me<br>that the prime reason for the inability of the officers of the Fleet to<br>Supervise their equipment is their lack of training.</p>
<p>On non-nuclear surface ships, officers are no longer required to<br>qualify as operating engineers. Contrary to the practice before World<br>War II, there are now no requirements for the captain of a ship even to</p>
<p>have served in the engineering department before he takes command.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The result is that many captains have little knowledge, respect, or<br>regard for their engineering plants; they do not know how to make a<br>critical inspection of these plants, nor can they even evaluate the<br>recommendations of their people. Is it any wonder that ships— even<br>new ones—are frequently found in poor material condition by outside<br>inspectors ?</p>
<p>The emphasis on operational experience is just the opposite in<br>nuclear ships. Since the beginning, I have required all nuclear ship</p>
<p>captains, as well as their subordinate officers, to qualify as operators</p>
<p>of the propulsion plant before being assigned to a ship. Prior to being<br>assigned as chief engineer, executive officer, or captain of a nuclear<br>ship, the nuclear trained officer must successfully complete a<br>comprehensive eight-hour written examination and a three-hour oral<br>examination at my headquarters in Washington. I personally approve<br>or disapprove all examination results. Before he is permitted to take<br>this examination, he must first have completed one year of academic<br>and operational training which includes qualification as a watch officer<br>on a fully operational, land prototype nuclear propulsion plant similar<br>to the ones we have at sea. An engineering department officer, once<br>he has completed his initial training, must qualify as a watch officer<br>in a nuclear ship and serve in the engineering department for at least<br>one year. To be eligible for the examination, he must also be</p>
<p>recommended by his commanding officer.</p>
<p>eso</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>These requirements produce line officers who are familiar with<br>the operating details of their propulsion plants and are not afraid to<br>get their hands dirty. When reports from subordinates conflict, or<br>where they doubt the accuracy, they know enough to look for themselves<br>and to put the weight of their own experience behind the decision.</p>
<p>Line officers must be taken out of technical positions they are not<br>qualified to hold. The aimless way in which the line officers have taken<br>over engineering in the Navy in the last ten years has just about destroyed<br>the engineering capacity of the Navy.</p>
<p>The staff of the Chief of Naval Operations has grown in recent years,<br>until it now includes 65 admirals. This is about twice as many as were<br>assigned to Fleet Admiral King&#x27;s staff at the height of World War IL.<br>These admirals, along with literally hundreds of other staff officers get<br>involved in technical matters for which they have no qualifications,<br>Recently, I attended a Chief of Naval Operations meeting at which the<br>only subject discussed was technical ship characteristics. In addition<br>to the large number of line admirals present, there was also a Marine<br>general—although the meeting had nothing to do with the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>He volunteered no comments; how could he?</p>
<p>Line officers ashore seem to spend much time on matters outside<br>of their responsibility or experience. This is reminiscent of a period<br>after World War I when, instead of devoting full time to the condition of<br>our ships, top Navy officials spent time on unimportant matters. As an<br>example, between World Wars I and II the Secretary of the Navy promulgated</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ss</p>
<p>a General Order—the highest type of official directive that can be issued—</p>
<p>concerning the Navy&#x27;s homing pigeon establishment. This Order divided<br>responsibilities for the care and operation of pigeons among the Bureau of<br>Engineering, the Bureau of Construction and Repair, the Bureau of<br>Navigation, and the Director of Naval Communications. All these<br>organizations were involved in pigeons at one time or another, Their<br>responsibilities included, among other things, pigeon population and banding,<br>transportation, housing and food. There were also plans and literature<br>concerning the pigeon service, miscellaneous equipment, and other</p>
<p>pigeon problems.<br>The pigeon service has now been abandoned by the Navy. That, along</p>
<p>with the disbanding of the last detachment of Indian Scouts in 1943, and the<br>requirement for Army aviators to wear spurs in 1938, is one of the rare<br>occasions in U.S. military history where a function has been abolished.</p>
<p>Today —with the inflated rank in the Navy— if we still had the pigeon<br>service—the senior pigeon in the pecking order would, I suppose, be a<br>line admiral. It would be claimed, as the argument so often goes, he<br>needed this rank to deal effectively with his peers in the Army, the Air<br>Force, and the other foreign pigeon services.</p>
<p>Today, many of our naval leaders are actually &quot;cheerleaders,&quot;<br>making heroic attempts to keep the Navy together with endless</p>
<p>exhortations and lectures on the value of leadership. Yet they,</p>
<p>themselves, are not knowledgeable enough to instruct or to see that</p>
<p>the work has been done properly. What we must recognize is that the<br>purpose of the Navy is to defend the country, not to provide a place<br>for comfortable careers. Because our officers are the cutting edge<br>of our military strength, we can make no compromise with their<br>ability.</p>
<p>Management is taught at Annapolis. This has done serious harm<br>to its young graduates. My people and I interview midshipmen before<br>they enter the nuclear program. One midshipman, who had taken<br>management courses, told me that he was able to learn my job in six<br>months; he could run General Electric in a year.</p>
<p>It was not his fault. It was no crime for him to give this answer.<br>He had been taught by his supposedly responsible and knowledgeable<br>professors that his job was to &quot;manage,&quot;&#x27;. . . that a naval officer<br>shouldn&#x27;t bother with technical details. Yet, the devil is in the details.</p>
<p>The service academies once gave professional education in<br>engineering. But since the end of World War II, Annapolis, at least,<br>has changed. It has added more and more social science courses so that<br>it now produces men more fitted for civilian life —if even for that—than<br>for a career in the Navy. Even rewards for scholastic ability do not</p>
<p>lead midshipmen further toward their careers. I recently learned of a</p>
<p>midshipman who will spend his senior year studying &#x27;&#x27;The Effects of</p>
<p>Low Frequency Electromagnetic Field on the Circadian Biorhythms of<br>Common Mice.&quot; We are raising a generation of naval officers who are<br>ill-equipped to carry out their jobs in peace or war. Does a naval officer<br>need to know the rhythms of mice ?</p>
<p>We should return to the bilinear system, in which the technical<br>bureaus reported directly to the Secretary of the Navy. They should<br>no longer report through the Chief of Naval Material to the Chief of<br>Naval Operations. The entire office of the Chief of Naval Material<br>with its huge staff should be recognized as the huge burden it is, and<br>disbanded. Not only would this step relieve those engaged in technical<br>work from unnecessary meetings and paperwork, it would allow the<br>Chief of Naval Operations to cut back on the size of his office. He<br>could then face his primary job: seeing to it that the Navy is ready for<br>war.</p>
<p>The line officer has a professional responsibility to learn how to<br>operate his ship and his fleet. From his experience, he should be able</p>
<p>to say what kinds of ships the Navy needs to meet its obligations.</p>
<p>Translating those requirements into operational hardware is the job<br>of the engineering officers and the civilian engineers. These men must<br>be forced to learn their job and assume responsibility for their work.</p>
<p>To do this requires long-term assignments. We can no longer permit</p>
<p>officers to hold their position for a short time before moving on to their<br>next job. The headquarters organization responsible for the design and<br>construction of ships should be reestablished as a technical organization<br>with its engineers returned to positions requiring them to be responsible<br>for the technical state of affairs instead of being field consultants. As</p>
<p>the Navy gains technical competence, it can build up its in-house technical<br>capability, and demand high quality work at reasonable cost from the</p>
<p>industrial contractors.</p>
<p>Unpleasant facts are unwelcome and no one builds statues to critics.<br>But today we are not quite as impatient of a critic as the ancient Locrians.<br>These people gave freedom of speech to all citizens. At public meetings<br>anyone could stand up and argue for changes in law or custom, on one<br>condition. A rope was placed around his neck before he began to speak<br>and, if what he said did not meet with public approval, he was forthwith<br>hanged. ‘That, no doubt, prevented disturbing the even tenor of familiar<br>customs and ways of life. Ihave encountered some in the Navy who look<br>with nostalgia on this ancient custom.</p>
<p>Today we have new leadership in the Navy and the Department of<br>Defense. I hope these men will give serious thought to reestablishing</p>
<p>engineering competence in the Navy.</p>
