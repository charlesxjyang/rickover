<p>For release Monday A. M. October 27, 1958</p>
<p>Of 26th fresident, teddy roosevelt</p>
<p>The nation will honor one of its most colorful Fresidents, Theodore Roosevelt, today, on the 100th anniversary of his birth.</p>
<p>Civic observances will be held throughout the country as Americans pause to pay tribute to their 26th President. The observances will mark the climax of a year-long centennial celebration which has been directed by a special Commission established by Congress.</p>
<p>Fresident Eisenhower issued a special Proclamation earlier in the year in which he called upon the American people to observe the 100th anniversary of TR's birth &quot;by appropriate activities and ceremonies, by the study of his life and teachings, and above all, by individual, personal rededication to those responsibilities of American citizenship which he so zestfully fulfilled.&quot;</p>
<p>President Eisenhower said further:</p>
<p>&quot;Theodore Roosevelt loved America with impassioned devotion and served her greatly in public office and as a private citizen, As President of the United States, his name is associated with epochal readjustments in the rela~ tions of govermment and industry, with the policy of con- servation which he established, with the building of the Fanama Canal, and with the peace that ended the Fusso- Japanese War, His appeals to conscience sank deep into the American heart and mind and wrought enduring changes,</p>
<p>&quot;A man of rich gifts in many fields, at home alike in</p>
<p>a ~=the..world..of—books.,..t id.of politics, and in the 000000</p>
<p>wild spaces where adventure called, he was historian and ranchman, huntsman and naturalist, Eough Pider, preacher, family man, and explorer, His contemporaries cherished</p>
<p>him as a two-fisted fighter who loved life, loved people, feared nobody, and was as much as ease with kings as with</p>
<p>cowboys, a wielder alike of the wingea pnrase ana Of Une sledge hammer, a dangerous antagonist, and an unforgetting, unforgettable friend,</p>
<p>&quot;Upon us who stand outside the circle of time in which men felt his personal spell, Theodore Roosevelt exercises a differ- ent and, perhaps, a deeper power. We see, and claim for our own, the word, the spirit, and the example that survive for us in this teasher of the principles underlying democratic insti- tutions--this summoner to participation in the procedures of free government, adjuring us, as he entreated the men and women of his own time, to accept the responsibilities of free citizenship. He was a man on fire for his country, who kindles</p>
<p>fires in our hearts, He was a prophet, calling upon us to fulfill our responsibilities not only for the sake of our own Nation and people but for the sake of those, throughout the world, who look to us for hope, inspiration, and leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>High point in the day's activities will be a dinner at Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace, 28 East 20th Street, New York, which is now headquarters for the Theodore Roosevelt Association.</p>
<p>General Alfred M. Gruenther and Vice Admiral Hyman G. Rickover will receive the Theodore Roosevelt Distinguished Service Medal, given by the Association.</p>
<p>The award was established in 1923 by the Association, &quot;to perpetuate his memory and to promote the development and application of his ideals for the benefit of the American people.&quot; The medals are given each year to distinguished citizens who have rendered outstanding public service in one of thirteen fields. General Gruenther and Admiral Rickover are to be honored for their singular con- tributions to the National Defense.</p>
<p>General Gruenther, now president of the American Red Cross, capped a long and brilliant military career with his service as NATO Commander-in-Chief, suc- ceeding his long time friend, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Admiral Rickover, still on active duty, is known as the &quot;father of the atomic submarine,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a particular pleasure to have the privilege of honoring these two great Americans,&quot; said Oscar S, Straus, President of the Association, &quot;for their devotion to the responsibilities of citizenship and to the nation's welfare are</p>
<p>typical of the qualities Mr. Roosevelt most admired,”</p>
<p>The Theodore Roosevelt Association was established in 1919, following the</p>
<p>death of the 26th President, and was granted a national charter by Act of Congress In the course of its existence, the Association has purchased Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River in Washington, D. C., and presented it to the nation.</p>
<p>It also has established a Memorial Park at Oyster Bay. The Association maintains</p>

<p>generals,,.who has made soft speaking its own compelling Big Stick,&quot;</p>
<p>Ex-officio: The President of the United States. The Vice-President Chairece The Ceeckee 4! the Un... wt</p>

<p>Washington's most bristling and fruitful genius.&quot;</p>
<p>Both General Gruenther and Admiral Rickover pointed out that Mr. Roosevelt's determination and his readiness to accept responsibility and hard work were qualities which made him an outstanding citizen, statesman and leader, Quoting the late President, Admiral Rickover said, &quot;The only life worth living is the life of effort...to attain what is worth striving for,&quot;</p>
